  "translation": "(10) Private conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve those who have believed,[1644] but he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allāh. And upon Allāh let the believers rely.",
  "footnotes": "[1644]- The reference may be to the sinful type of conversation, as mentioned in the previous verses, or to the practice of two persons speaking in confidence in the presence of a third, which might lead him to assume that he is the subject of their conversation.  Such behavior was prohibited by the Prophet (ﷺ) in narrations of al-Bukhārī and Muslim."
