    "translation": "(2) It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture[1651] from their homes at the first gathering.[1652] You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh; but [the decree of] Allāh came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision.",
    "footnotes": "[1651]- Referring to the Jews of Banun-Naḍeer, who broke their pact with the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).\n[1652]- This was the first tme they had ever been gathered and expelled."
