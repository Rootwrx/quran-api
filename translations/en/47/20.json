  "translation": "(20) Those who believe say, \"Why has a sūrah[1502] not been sent down?\" But when a precise sūrah is revealed and battle is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] looking at you with a look of one overcome by death. And more appropriate for them[1503] [would have been]",
  "footnotes": "[1502]- i.e., one in which permission is given the believers to fight their enemies.\n[1503]- The words \"awlā lahum\" can also be interpreted as \"woe to them!\"  In that case, the following verse would begin, \"[Better for them would have been] obedience and good words.\""
