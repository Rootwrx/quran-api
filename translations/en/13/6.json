    "translation": "(6) They impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good,[628] while there has already occurred before them similar punishments [to what they demand]. And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing, and indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty.",
    "footnotes": "[628]- They said, challenging the Prophet (ﷺ) in ridicule, \"Bring on the punishment, if you are truthful,\" rather than asking for mercy and forgiveness from Allāh."
