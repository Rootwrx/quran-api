  "translation": "(23) Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, and Allāh has sent him astray due to knowledge[1473] and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? So who will guide him after Allāh? Then will you not be reminded?",
  "footnotes": "[1473]- This can refer to Allāh's knowledge of that person and of his preference for his own inclinations or to that person's knowledge of the truth while he refuses it."
