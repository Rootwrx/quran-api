    "translation": "(138) And they say, \"These animals[349] and crops are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will,\" by their claim. And there are those [camels] whose backs are forbidden [by them][350] and those upon which the name of Allāh is not mentioned[351] - [all of this] an invention of untruth about Him.[352] He will punish them for what they were inventing.",
    "footnotes": "[349]- The four categories of grazing livestock called \"anʿām\" collectively.\n[350]- See 5:103.\n[351]- At the time of slaughter.  Rather, they are dedicated to others among their \"deities.\"\n[352]- i.e., false assertions that such practices are part of Allāh's religion."
