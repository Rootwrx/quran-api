  "translation": "(119) And why should you not eat of that upon which the name of Allāh has been mentioned while He has explained in detail to you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you are compelled.[340] And indeed do many lead [others] astray through their [own] inclinations without knowledge. Indeed, your Lord - He is most knowing of the transgressors.",
  "footnotes": "[340]- In cases of dire necessity, what is normally prohibited becomes permissible, but only to the extent of the need."
