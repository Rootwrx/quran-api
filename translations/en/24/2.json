  "translation": "(2) The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse[972] - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes,[973] and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion [i.e., law] of Allāh,[974] if you should believe in Allāh and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[972]- Either by voluntary confession of the offender or the testimony of four male witnesses to having actually seen the act take place.  Otherwise, there can be no conviction.\n[973]- The ruling in this verse is applicable to unmarried fornicators.  Execution by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for convicted adulterers.\n[974]- i.e., Do not let sympathy for a guilty person move you to alter anything ordained by Allāh, for in His law is protection of society as a whole."
