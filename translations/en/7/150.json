  "translation": "(150) And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, \"How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?\" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head, pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, indeed the people overpowered me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me[407] and do not place me among the wrongdoing people.\"",
  "footnotes": "[407]- i.e., over your humiliation of me."
