  "translation": "(20) They think the companies have not [yet] withdrawn.[1191] And if the companies should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins, inquiring [from afar] about your news. And if they should be among you, they would not fight except for a little.",
  "footnotes": "[1191]- In their excessive fear the cowardly hypocrites could not believe the enemy forces had been defeated."
