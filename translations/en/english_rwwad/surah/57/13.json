  "translation": "On that Day the hypocrite men and women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said, “Go back and seek light elsewhere[11].” Then a wall will be placed between them, which will have a gate[12], on the inside of which there will be mercy and on the outside there will be punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[11] i.e., the worldly life from where the light was acquired. [12] This wall is said to be the barrier between Paradise and Hell, which is called Al-A‘rāf (the heights). See 7:46-49."
