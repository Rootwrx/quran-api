  "translation": "The hypocrites will call out to the believers, “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, but you allowed yourselves[13] to succumb to temptations, you awaited [some misfortune to befall us], you doubted, and you were deceived by false hopes, until Allah’s decree came to pass. Thus the deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning Allah.",
  "footnotes": "[13] By hypocrisy."
