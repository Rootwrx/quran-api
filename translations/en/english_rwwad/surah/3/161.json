  "translation": "It is not for a prophet to misappropriate the spoils of war. Whoever misappropriates will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection[76]. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged.",
  "footnotes": "[76] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “By Allah none of you wrongfully appropriates part of it (war booty) without him meeting Allah on the Day of Judgment carrying it. I shall know everyone of you who meets Allah carrying a camel grunting, a cow bellowing, or a goat bleating...” [Al-Bukhārī: 6979, Muslim: 1832]. Al-Qurṭubī (4:256) comments: “He comes carrying it on his back and neck, tormented by its weight, horrified by its atrocious sound, and berated by making his dishonesty known to all people…”."
