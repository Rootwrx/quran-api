  "translation": "There has been a sign for you in the two groups who confronted each other: one fighting for the cause of Allah, and the other disbelievers; they saw them, with their own eyes twice their number[7]. But Allah strengthens with His help whom He wills. There is a lesson in this for those who have insight.",
  "footnotes": "[7] The believers saw the disbelievers to be double their own number preceding the battle of Badr, while, in fact, they were three times their number."
