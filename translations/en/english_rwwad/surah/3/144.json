    "translation": "Muhammad is no more than a messenger; there were messengers who passed away before him[63]. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels[64]? Anyone who turns back on his heels will not harm Allah in the least, but Allah will reward those who are grateful.",
    "footnotes": "[63] The laws of nature apply to them too.\n [64] This smacks the faltering position that some Muslims took when it was rumored during the Battle of Uhud that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) had met his death."
