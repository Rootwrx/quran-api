    "translation": "It is by Allah’s mercy that you [O Prophet] became lenient to them[74]. If you had been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from you. So pardon them, seek forgiveness for them, and consult them in important matters[75]. But once you have made a decision, put your trust in Allah, for Allah loves those who put their trust in Him.",
    "footnotes": "[74] In the Battle of Uhud, the Prophet (ﷺ) was made to show leniency to the believers who disobeyed his commands.\n [75] The principle of shūra (consultation) is a cornerstone and one of the greatest traits of the Islamic community."
