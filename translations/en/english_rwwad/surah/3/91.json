    "footnotes": "[39] The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"A disbeliever will be asked: ‘Suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth, would you offer it to ransom yourself (from the Hell-Fire)?’ He will reply, ‘Yes.’ Then it will be said to him, ‘You were asked for something less than that (to join none in worship) with Allah, but you refused. \" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 546]"
