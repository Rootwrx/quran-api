    "translation": "Do not think of those who are delighted with their misdeeds and love to be praised for what they have not done[90]; so do not think that they will be safe from the punishment, and for them there will be a painful punishment.",
    "footnotes": "[90] Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudrī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the reason for the revelation of this verse was such that: “Some hypocrites at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) would stay behind when he used to set out on forays, and they were pleased with this. Upon his return, they would forge excuses and swear to them. They even loved to be praised for what they did not do (i.e., being believers and part of the Prophet’s (ﷺ) army). Thus this verse was revealed”. [Al-Bukhārī: 4567, Muslim: 2777]"
