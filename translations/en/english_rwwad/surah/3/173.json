  "translation": "those[82] to whom people[83] said, “Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.” But it only increased them in faith, and they said, “Allah is Sufficient for us, and He is the best Protector[84].”",
  "footnotes": "[82] The believers.\n [83] The hypocrites. [84] This is one of the greatest Dhikr (remembrance) during times of hardship. Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “Hasbunā Allāh wa ni‘ma al-Wakīl (Allah suffices us, He is the best of Protectors), was said by Abraham (عليه السلام) when he was thrown in the fire and was said by Muhammad (ﷺ) when it was said: “People have regrouped for you, so fear them”, their belief grew firmer and they said: “Allah suffices us, He is the best of Protectors”.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4563]"
