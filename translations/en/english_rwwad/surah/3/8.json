  "footnotes": "[5] ’Umm Salamah (رضي الله عنها) reported: “The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray most by saying: “O He Who changes hearts, make my heart firm in Your religion” (yā Muqallib al-qulūb, thabbit qalbī ‘alā dīnik). When she asked him the reason for this, he (ﷺ) replied, saying: “Umm Salamah, know that every human’s heart is between two Fingers of Allah. Whoever He wills, He makes steadfast, and Whoever He wills He causes to deviate”. [Al-Tirmidhī: 3522]"
