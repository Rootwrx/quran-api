  "translation": "When she gave birth, she said, “My Lord, I have given birth to a female child,” – and Allah knew best what she had given birth to – “and the male is not like the female. I have named her Mary[16], and I seek refuge with You for her and her offspring from Satan[17], the accursed.”",
  "footnotes": "[16] Maryam (مريم) literally means: maidservant of Allah. [17] Allah answered her prayers. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Every newborn child is touched by the devil and they start off by wailing because of this touch, except Maryam and her son”. [Al-Bukhāri: 3231, Muslim: 2366]"
