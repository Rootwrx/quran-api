  "translation": "Allah would not leave the believers in the state you are in, until He distinguishes the evil from the good[86], nor would Allah reveal to you [believers] the unseen, but Allah chooses from His messengers[87] whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers; if you believe and fear Allah, you will have a great reward.",
  "footnotes": "[86] Hypocrites were initially living in the midst of the believers pretending to be believers and wishing for the worst to come upon the real believers. In order to separate the wheat from the chaff, Allah decreed the calamity in the Battle of Uhud; so the hypocrites could be told apart. [87] The unseen here was informing the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) about the real hypocrites so that he may be on guard against them."
