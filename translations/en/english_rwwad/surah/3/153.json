    "translation": "[Remember] when you were fleeing without even casting a glance at anyone, and the Messenger was calling you back. You were then given distress[69] upon distress, so you should not grieve for what you missed or for what you suffered. For Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
    "footnotes": "[69] The news of the rumored death of the Prophet (ﷺ) hit them after losing the ground in the battle, so they soon forgot the defeat that had been inflicted on them."
