  "footnotes": "[9] i.e., It is a Day that everyone will find before him great difficulty. According to a long and authentic Hadīth of Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudrī, \"the Shin\" refers to that of Allah Almighty, before which every believer will prostrate on the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers and hypocrites will not be able to prostrate. The text of the Hadith is as follows: \"... Then the Lord will uncover His Shank, so they will prostrate to Him...\"."
