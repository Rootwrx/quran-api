  "translation": "And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac[25], a prophet, and one of the righteous.",
  "footnotes": "[25] The birth of Isaac is mentioned after the story of sacrifice, which verifies that the firstborn son who was sacrificed was indeed Ishmael and not Isaac, contrary to what is claimed by the Jews and Christians. This is also supported by 11:71, where Sarah is told that she would give birth to Isaac, who would have a son by the name of Jacob."
