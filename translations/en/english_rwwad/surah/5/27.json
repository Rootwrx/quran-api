  "translation": "Relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth, when both offered a sacrifice; it was accepted from one [i.e., Abel] but not accepted from the other [i.e., Cain][25]. The latter said, “I will kill you.” The former said, “Allah only accepts from those who fear Him.",
  "footnotes": "[25] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “No soul ever gets killed unjustifiably, unless the early son of Adam (Cain) gets some of the burden of its blood, for he was the first human to spill blood”. [Al-Bukhārī: 3335, Muslim: 1677]"
