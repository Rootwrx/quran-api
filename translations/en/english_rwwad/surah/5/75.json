  "translation": "The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. There were messengers who passed away before him, and His mother was a woman of truth; they both ate food[58]. See how We make Our signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded!",
  "footnotes": "[58] They both were in need of sustenance, proving that they were not divine beings, unlike Allah Almighty Who is in no need of anything while everything is in need of Him."
