    "translation": "O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if they are made known to you, would only cause you hardship[67]. If you inquire about them while the Qur’an is being revealed, they will be made known to you. Allah has pardoned you for it. Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.",
    "footnotes": "[67] i.e., especially contrived questions, if responded to will widen the circle of divine ordinances, which might cause difficulty for the believers to act on them."
