  "translation": "nor do I think that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better than this[23].”",
  "footnotes": "[23] He thought should there be a tiny possibility of resurrection, based on his wrongful calculation that he was honored in this life because Allah loved him. Hence he fell into the fallacy that if he ever return to Him, he should only expect greater honoring, or he might have said that deridingly."
