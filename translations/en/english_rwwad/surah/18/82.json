    "translation": "As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was a treasure under it that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man, so your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and retrieve their treasure[39], as a mercy from your Lord; I did not do it of my own accord. This is the interpretation of that which you could not bear with patience.”",
    "footnotes": "[39] Had they not mended the wall, it would have subsequently fallen; they, being young, weak, and surrounded by mean people, would certainly have lost their treasure."
