  "footnotes": "[40] The Two-Horned Sovereign, about whom the Quraysh pagans asked the Prophet (ﷺ), along with that of the Companions of the Cave, testing his prophethood. He was named thus because he reached the rising point and the setting point of the sun; or two generations (qarns) of people passed away during his reign; or he had two long locks of hair; or his crown had two horns."
