    "translation": "And [remember] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all prostrated except Iblīs, who was one of the jinn, but he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors instead of Me[28], even though they are your enemies[29]? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers!",
    "footnotes": "[28] Demons could possess their idols and communicate through them; they also used to seek refuge from the evil of the jinn by appraising them and slaughtering sacrifices for them.\n [29] Satan along with his fellow demons continues to lead people astray from the right Path."
