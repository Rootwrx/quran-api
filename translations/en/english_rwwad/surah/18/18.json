    "translation": "You would have thought they were awake, although they were asleep. We turned them over on their right and left sides, when their dog stretched its forelegs at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have fled away from them, filled with horror[12].",
    "footnotes": "[12] Should anyone were to see them, he would see a group of awake men with a dog standing guarding them, and would surely be filled with horror, which was a factor in preserving them, so no one would dare to draw close to them."
