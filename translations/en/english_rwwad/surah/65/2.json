  "translation": "Then when they have approached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or part with them honorably[3]. Call two just men from among yourselves as witnesses, and give true testimony for the sake of Allah. This is an exhortation for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. Whoever fears Allah, He will make a way out for him[4],",
  "footnotes": "[3] A husband may return to his wife after the first or the second divorce (revocable divorce) or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period (Irrevocable divorce). The wife will have to marry and get divorced by another man before she can remarry her ex-husband. See 2:230.\n [4] i.e., relief from distress and inconvenience."
