    "translation": "Indeed, those who came up with the slander[7] are a group among you. Do not think that it is bad for you, rather it is good for you[8]. Each one of them is responsible for what he earned of the sin, and the one who played the major role[9], for him there will be a grave punishment.",
    "footnotes": "[7] It refers to the incident when the Prophet's wife ‘Ā’ishah was falsely accused by the hypocrites.\n [8] For its reward from Allah; believers being distinguished from hypocrites; and ‘Ā’ishah being absolved from false accusation, etc.\n [9] i.e., ‘Abdullah ibn ’Ubayy, leader of the hypocrites in Madinah."
