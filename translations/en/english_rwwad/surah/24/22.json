  "translation": "The people of virtue and affluence among you should not swear to withhold their aid from their relatives, the needy and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and overlook. Do you not like to be forgiven by Allah? For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful[13].",
  "footnotes": "[13] Abu Bakr As-Siddīq, ‘Ā’ishah’s father, swore to stop his financial help to his poor cousin, Mistah ibn Athāthah, for he took part in the rumors against ‘Ā’ishah. When this verse was revealed, Abu Bakr resumed his assistance to him."
