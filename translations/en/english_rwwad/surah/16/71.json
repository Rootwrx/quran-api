  "translation": "Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. Those who are favored will not share their provision with their slaves, so that they may become equal to them[46]. Do they then deny the favors of Allah?",
  "footnotes": "[46] If they would not accept to equally share their provision with their slaves, how would then they set up associates with Allah in worship?"
