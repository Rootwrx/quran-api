  "translation": "Allah’s decree is coming[1], so do not seek to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him[2]!",
  "footnotes": "[1] Allah’s punishment is imminent and certain, as the Hour is approaching.\n [2] Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is the most egregious of all sins, as He warned against it right after mentioning the imminence of the Hour. Allah stresses against Shirk or calls for pure Tawhīd (monotheism) in the two subsequent verses as well."
