  "translation": "And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god besides Him. Do not give short measure or weight[49]. I see that you are in prosperity, but I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing Day.",
  "footnotes": "[49] The cardinal sin of Lot’s people was lust, whereas the people of Shu‘ayb’s major sin was greed, for not being fair in trade."
