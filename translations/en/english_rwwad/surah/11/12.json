  "translation": "Perhaps you may disregard some of what is revealed to you [O Prophet][6], and may feel distressed because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down to him, or why has not an angel come with him?” You are only a warner[7], and Allah is in charge of all things.",
  "footnotes": "[6] i.e., things that they may find arduous to act upon. [7] The Prophet (ﷺ) is tasked only to deliver the message, not to fulfill their whimsical wishes."
