  "translation": "So when she came, she was asked, “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It looks as if it is the same. We were given knowledge beforehand[11], and have submitted [to Allah].”",
  "footnotes": "[11] Because he had refused our tribute sent to him, or we had known about his kingdom and authority before seeing this sign of bringing the throne from this long distance. Or \"We were given knowledge beforehand\" was Prophet Solomon’s statement, which means: We were given knowledge beforehand that she will come submitting to Allah, and we were submissive and obedient to Allah Almighty."
