  "translation": "But the one who had some knowledge of the scripture[10] said, “I will bring it to you in the blink of your eye.” When he saw it placed before him, he said, “This is a favor of my Lord, to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful, it is only for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”",
  "footnotes": "[10] i.e., A man of righteousness and knowledge of the scripture who also knew Allah's Magnificent Name (Al-’Ism Al-‘Azam), by Which if supplication was made would be answered."
