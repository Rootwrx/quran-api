  "translation": "And I will surely mislead them and arouse in them false hopes, and will order them to slit the ears of livestock, and will order them to change Allah’s creation[87].” Whoever takes Satan as a protector instead of Allah has surely suffered a manifest loss.",
  "footnotes": "[87] The Arab idolaters used to cut off the ears of cattle as a sign that such were dedicated to their gods, making them unlawful to eat; calling such cattle bahīrah. By doing so, they followed the path of Satan, not that of Allah Who made the eating of cattle lawful."
