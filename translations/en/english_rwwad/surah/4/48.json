  "translation": "Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him[34], but forgives anything less than that for whom He wills. Whoever associates partners with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin.",
  "footnotes": "[34] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Allah will say to that person of the Hellfire who will receive the least punishment, ‘If you had everything on the earth, would you give it as a ransom to free yourself?’ He will say, `Yes’. Then Allah will say, ‘While you were in the backbone of Adam, I asked you much less than this, (i.e., not to worship others besides Me), but you insisted on worshiping others besides me.’\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 551]"
