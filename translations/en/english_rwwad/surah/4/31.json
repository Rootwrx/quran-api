What are they?\" He said, \"(1) To associate partners with Allah, (2) sorcery; (3) to kill a person whom Allah has forbidden except for a just cause; (4) to consume Ribā (usury); (5) to eat up the property of an orphan; (6) to turn one’s back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of fighting and (7) to accuse innocent chaste women of immorality.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 840]"
