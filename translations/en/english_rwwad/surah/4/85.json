  "translation": "Whoever intercedes in a good cause will have a share in its reward, but whoever intercedes in an evil cause will have a share in its burden[64]. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.",
  "footnotes": "[64] Abu Mūsa al-Ash‘arī (رضي الله عنه) said: “When a person in need came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or when he was asked for something, he would announce: “Intercede; you will be rewarded!” [Al-Bukhārī: 1432] Yet when a person knowingly helps someone who intends evil is a partner in that misdeed and thus will reap a portion of that evil."
