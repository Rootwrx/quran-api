    "translation": "Have you not seen [O Prophet] those[45] who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, yet they seek the judgment of Tāghoot[46] [i.e., false judges][47], even though they were commanded to reject them? Satan wants to lead them far astray.",
    "footnotes": "[45] i.e., the hypocrites.\n [46] Tāghūt: See 2:256. [47] This verse was revealed about a group of the Aslam tribe, who professed Islam, then went to Abu Zurārah al-Aslamī, the soothsayer, to settle a dispute."
