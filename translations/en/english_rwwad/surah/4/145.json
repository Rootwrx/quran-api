Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. 4. Whenever he quarrels, he behaves in an insulting manner.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 33]. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"The worst people before Allah on the Day of Judgment will be the double-faced people who appear to some people with one face and to other people with another face.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 84]"
