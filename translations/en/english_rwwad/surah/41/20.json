  "footnotes": "[9] On the Day of Judgment, the wicked will deny the evil deeds in their record of deeds - in an attempt to escape the punishment. They will be asked if they accept Allah, the angels, or even their own families and neighbors as witnesses, but they will refuse. So Allah will make their organs testify against them. [Ibn Kathīr]"
