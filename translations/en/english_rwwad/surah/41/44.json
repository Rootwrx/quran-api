  "translation": "If We had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have said, “If only its verses were made clear? What! A non-Arabic [book] and an Arab [messenger]?” Say, “It is a guidance and healing for those who believe. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears and they are blind to [understand] it – it is as if they are being called from a far-off place[19].”",
  "footnotes": "[19] So they neither hear the call nor understand it."
