  "translation": "We assigned to them [evil] associates[10] who made appealing to them what was before them[11] and what was behind them[12], so the decree [of punishment] became due against them along with nations that passed before them of jinn and men, for indeed they were losers.",
  "footnotes": "[10] In this world among the jinn and men.\n [11] Of neglecting the reckoning and account in the Hereafter.\n [12] Of their disbelief and evil deeds in this world."
