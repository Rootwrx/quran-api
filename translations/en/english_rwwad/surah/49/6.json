    "footnotes": "[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) sent Al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ait to collect zakah (alms-tax) from the tribe of Bani Al-Mustaliq. They went out to receive Al-Walīd but he thought that they wanted to harm him. So, he quickly came back to the Prophet (ﷺ) with the bad news, so he wanted to punish them. After a while, a delegation from Bani Al-Mustaliq came to clear the misunderstanding."
