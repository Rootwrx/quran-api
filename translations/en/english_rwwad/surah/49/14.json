    "translation": "The Bedouins say, “We have believed.” Say, “You have not believed, but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts[8]. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from the reward of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
    "footnotes": "[8] There is a distinction between Islam and Imān (faith). Imān is a higher degree than Islam. This distinction is mentioned in an authentic Hadīth of the Prophet (ﷺ), known as the Hadīth of Gabriel."
