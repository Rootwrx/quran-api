  "translation": "He makes this comparison for you from your own lives: do you have among your slaves any partners who equally share with you whatever wealth we have given you[10], so you are fearing them as you fear one another[11]? This is how We make the verses clear for people who understand.",
  "footnotes": "[10] Here Allah says that humans would not let their slaves be their partners in their wealth, how can they accept helpless humans as partners with Allah Who owns the whole universe in His dominion?!\n [11] So you fear those slaves to share with you your wealth equally, similar to your fear of your free partners to share with you your wealth."
