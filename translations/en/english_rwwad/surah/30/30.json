  "translation": "Adhere sincerely to the true religion in all uprightness. This is the natural disposition[12] with which Allah has created mankind. There is no change in Allah’s creation. This is the straight religion, but most people do not know[13].",
  "footnotes": "[12] Fitrah: the natural inborn inclination of man to worship his Lord prior to the corruption of his nature by external influences. Thus, the Islamic monotheistic faith is described as the religion of fitrah - that of the inherent nature of humankind.\n [13] i.e., let people stay committed to their fitrah within the religion of Islam."
