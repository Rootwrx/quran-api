  "footnotes": "[1] These five verses (1-5) are the first ever verses revealed of the Qur’an. The Prophet (ﷺ) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Makkah when the angel Gabriel appeared before him, and ordered him to read. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) was unlettered, he would respond, “I cannot read.” Gabriel would then squeeze him tightly and order him again to read. Ultimately, Gabriel said to him: “Read in the name of your Lord …”."
