  "translation": "A believing man from the house of Pharaoh, who was concealing his faith, said, “Would you kill a man[6] simply because he says: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ even though he has come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, he will suffer the consequences of his lie, but if he is truthful, some of what he is threatening you with will befall you. Surely Allah does not guide anyone who is a transgressor and an utter liar.",
  "footnotes": "[6] i.e., Moses."
