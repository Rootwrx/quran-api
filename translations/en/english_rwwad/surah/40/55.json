    "translation": "So be patient, for Allah’s promise is true. Seek forgiveness for your sin[13], and glorify your Lord with His praise evening and morning.",
    "footnotes": "[13] Like all other prophets and messengers, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was infallible of sins, especially concerning what they conveyed from Allah. However, flaws or mistakes could happen with prophets, like all other human beings. The examples include the Prophet’s response to the blind man (80:1-10); Jonah’s departure from his people without Allah’s permission (21:87-88); and David’s suspicion and fear of the two men who scaled the wall of his chamber (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ﷺ) himself is urged to seek Allah’s forgiveness, then the believers are far more in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."
