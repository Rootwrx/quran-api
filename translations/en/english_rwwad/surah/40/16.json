  "translation": "the Day when they will be brought forth, nothing about them will be hidden from Allah. [He will say], “To whom does the dominion belong this Day[4]? To Allah, the One, the Subjugator!",
  "footnotes": "[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) said that everyone and everything that has ever existed will die on that Day, except for Allah, the Eternal. He will then ask, “To who belongs all authority this Day? Where are the kings of the world? I am the King.” Since no one will be there to answer, Allah will answer Himself, “To Allah, the One, the Supreme!” [Sahih Muslim]."
