  "translation": "It is He Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, and He has made between them a barrier and an insurmountable partition[29].",
  "footnotes": "[29] When salt and fresh waters meet, although both mix together, each still keeps its distinctive qualities, as if a barrier prevents them from mixing completely."
