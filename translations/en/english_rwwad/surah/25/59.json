  "translation": "it is He Who created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in six Days[33], then rose over the Throne[34]. He is the Most Compassionate, so ask about Him the One Who is All-Aware.",
  "footnotes": "[33] The \"six Days\" does not necessarily mean six 24 hours of time; for a heavenly Day is 1,000 years of our time. (see 22:47), whereas the Day of Judgment will be 50,000 years of our time (see 70:4). Hence, its duration is only known to Allah.\n [34] See footnote 7:54."
