  "footnotes": "[2] i.e., the strength of body and mind.\n [3] Archangel Gabriel appeared to the Prophet (ﷺ) only twice in his angelic form: once at the outset of the Prophet’s mission (as he manifested himself, filling the horizon, so the Prophet (ﷺ) lost his consciousness), and another time during the Prophet’s ascension to the seventh heaven where he directly received from Allah the order to pray five times a day. See 17:1."
