  "translation": "Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy themselves [in this world] and they eat as cattle eat[8]; their final abode is the Fire.",
  "footnotes": "[8] The disbelievers enjoy their life while they are oblivious of their consequences in the Hereafter, just like the cattle that graze in the pasture not knowing that they will probably be slaughtered soon."
