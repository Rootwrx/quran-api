    "translation": "Those who believe say, “If only a Chapter were sent down [about fighting]? But when a precise Chapter is sent down and fighting[15] is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking at you like someone who is about to die. It would have been better for them[16]",
    "footnotes": "[15] The believers longed for a Qur’anic revelation that would give them permission to fight their enemies.\n [16] It could also mean “Woe to them!” if disconnected from the next verse."
