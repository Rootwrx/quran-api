  "translation": "It is He Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book[1] from their homes as the first banishment[2]. You did not think that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But [the punishment of] Allah came upon them from where they did not expect and He cast dread in their hearts, destroying their homes with their own hands[3] and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O you people of insight.",
  "footnotes": "[1] It refers to the Jews of Banū Nadīr, who broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ).\n [2] This was the first time ever that they were gathered and expelled from Madinah to the Levant.\n [3] In order that the believers do not benefit from their homes."
