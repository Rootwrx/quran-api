    "translation": "Whatever palm trees you cut down[4] or left standing on their trunks[5], it was by Allah’s Will, so that He might disgrace the evildoers[6].",
    "footnotes": "[4] To enrage the enemies of Allah.\n [5] To benefit from them.\n [6] When the Muslim army was about to enter the fort of Banū Nadīr, they cut down some of their palm trees, so the Jews were terrified and alleged that this was corruption. So the Muslims disagreed about it; some of them said not to cut the trees, for these are gains that Allah has bestowed upon us, while some others said that we cut them off to enrage them. Hence, this verse was revealed to appease both parties of the Muslims, proclaiming that all this happened by the will of Allah. They were treated as such for their betrayal as they broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ)."
