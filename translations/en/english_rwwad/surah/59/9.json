  "translation": "As for those who were settled in the city [of Madinah][10] and embraced Islam before them, they love those who migrated to them and find no covetous desire in their hearts for what they were given. Rather they give them preference over themselves even though they may be in dire need. Whoever is protected from the covetousness of their souls, it is they who are successful.",
  "footnotes": "[10] Referring to the dwellers of Madinah, Ansār (the Helpers) who helped the believers and the Islamic cause since the inception of the Prophet’s mission."
