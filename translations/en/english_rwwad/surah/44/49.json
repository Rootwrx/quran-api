    "footnotes": "[12] Abu Jahl, the chief of pagans in Makkah, replied to the warning of punishment in the Hereafter by saying, “How can I be punished when I am the mighty and honorable one!” So Allah killed him in the Battle of Badr and humiliated him, and revealed this verse. He will be taunted with these words in Hell as a reminder of his own words and additional torment."
