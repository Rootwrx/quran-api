    "translation": "In his absence, the people of Moses took for worship an image of calf made from their jewelry that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor could it guide them[50] to any [straight] way? Yet they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers.",
    "footnotes": "[50] This mere body even lacked the basic attributes of being a god, as it was unable to speak to them or benefit them."
