  "translation": "Say, “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions[8] that Allah has brought forth for His slaves?” Say, “They are for the believers in the life of this world, and they will be exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection. This is how We make the verses clear for people who have knowledge.”",
  "footnotes": "[8] These adornments and lawful provisions may be enjoyed by both the believers and the disbelievers only in this life."
