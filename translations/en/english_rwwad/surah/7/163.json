    "translation": "Ask them [O Prophet] about the town which was by the sea and how they broke the Sabbath[63]. The fish would come to them appearing on the surface of the water on Sabbath days, but when it was not Sabbath, they would not come. This is how We tested them for their rebelliousness.",
