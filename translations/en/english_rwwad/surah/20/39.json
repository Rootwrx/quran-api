  "translation": "‘Put him into the casket, then cast it into the river. The river will carry it to the shore, and he will be picked up by one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him.’ I bestowed upon you love from Myself[9] so that you would be brought up under My [watchful] Eye.",
  "footnotes": "[9] Allah put his love into the hearts of people, so Pharaoh and his wife accepted to keep him or adopt him as a son when he was still a baby."
