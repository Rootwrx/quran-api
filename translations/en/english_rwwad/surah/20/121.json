  "translation": "So they both ate from the tree, then their nakedness was revealed to each other, and they began to put together leaves from Paradise to cover themselves. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error[45].",
  "footnotes": "[45] Unlike the Bible, the Qur’an does not put the blame on Eve for Adam’s sin, for which they were ousted from the Garden and sent down to the earth. See: (Genesis 3)."
