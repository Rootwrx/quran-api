    "translation": "When your sister was going along and said, ‘Shall I show you someone who will nurse him?’ Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that she may rejoice and not grieve[10]. Then you killed a man [by mistake][11], but We saved you from distress, and We put you through several trials. You stayed among the people of Midian for several years, then you came [here] at a destined time, O Moses.",
    "footnotes": "[10] Because Moses had refused all wet-nurses who were brought to nurse him beforehand.\n [11] The Coptic person died after Moses struck him."
