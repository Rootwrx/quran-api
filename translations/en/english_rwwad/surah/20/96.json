  "translation": "He said, “I saw something they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the hoof-print of the horse of the messenger [Gabriel] and cast it [into the fire][30]. This is what my mind prompted me.”",
  "footnotes": "[30] While Moses and the Children of Israel were crossing the sea, the Sāmiri saw Gabriel on a horse leading the way, so he took a handful of dust from the hoof-prints of his horse and later threw it at the calf that was made out of the melted ornaments so it started making a bellowing sound."
