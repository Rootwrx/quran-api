  "translation": "So Exalted is Allah, the True Sovereign[41]. Do not hasten to [recite] the Qur’an before its revelation to you is concluded[42], and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”",
  "footnotes": "[41] Of everything in existence.\n [42] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was eager to recite the Qur’an while it was being revealed, so Allah Almighty told him to avoid being in haste in order to learn them before the verses are properly delivered; rather, listen to them attentively."
