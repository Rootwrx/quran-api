  "translation": "Indeed, We tested Solomon and cast upon his throne a body, then he turned [to Allah][15].",
  "footnotes": "[15] The Prophet (ﷺ) said that one night Solomon said that each one of his wives would conceive a boy who would fight for the sake of Allah. He forgot to say ‘Allah willing,’ so only one of them gave birth to a deformed, dead baby. So Solomon sought Allah’s forgiveness. [Al-Bukhāri]"
