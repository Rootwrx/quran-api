  "translation": "[We said], “Take a bunch of grass in your hand, and strike [your wife] with it, and do not break your oath[19].” We truly found him patient – an excellent and faithful slave he was. He constantly turned [to Us].",
  "footnotes": "[19] When Job was afflicted with illness, everyone abandoned him except his wife. Once he became angry with her and vowed to punish her with one hundred lashes if he recovered. According to Allah's instruction, the oath was fulfilled by striking her once with one hundred blades of grass without harming his wife."
