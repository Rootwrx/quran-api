  "translation": "[He ordered], “Bring them back to me,” and he began striking [their] shanks and necks[14].",
  "footnotes": "[14] With his sword as expiation, for it might have been permissible in their law, especially if it had been for the sake of Allah such as missing prayer or the like; this is a more correct view. However, Ibn Jarīr favored the view that Solomon began to rub down their legs and necks with the hand, not by the sword."
