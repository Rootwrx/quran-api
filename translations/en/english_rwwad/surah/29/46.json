  "translation": "Do not argue with the People of the Book except in the best manner, unless with those of them who transgress[17] [against you]. And say, “We believe in what is sent down to us and what was sent down to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit.”",
  "footnotes": "[17] Those who are obstinate and oppressive against Muslims, should not be dealt with in the best manner, for it will make them persist in their disbelief and transgression."
