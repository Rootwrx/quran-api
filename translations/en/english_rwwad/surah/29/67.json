    "translation": "Do they not see that We have made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people around them are being snatched away?[20] Do they still believe in falsehood[21] and show ingratitude to Allah’s favors?",
    "footnotes": "[20] Makkah, especially Ka‘bah, was considered a sanctuary; as fighting was forbidden therein, and whoever entered it was safe. Whereas people were being killed and taken as captives in other cities of Arabia.\n [21] i.e., in idols and false gods."
