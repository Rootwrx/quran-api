  "translation": "Then when We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing showed them that he was dead except a creature of the earth[8] eating away his staff[9]. When he fell down, the jinn realized that if they had truly known the unseen, they would not have remained in the debasing servitude[10].",
  "footnotes": "[8] i.e., a termite was gnawing his staff. [9] Upon which he was leaning.\n [10] It is proof that the jinn do not have knowledge of the unseen."
