    "translation": "But they said, “Our Lord, make [the distance between] our journeys longer[14],” and they wronged themselves. So We made them tales [of the past], and dispersed them in all directions. Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is patient and grateful.",
    "footnotes": "[14] They were bored of a comfortable life and easy traveling. Similarly, the Children of Israel were bored of eating the manna and quails and sought other types of food such as onions, garlic, cucumber, etc. See 2:61."
