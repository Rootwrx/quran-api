  "translation": "Say, “Can any of your [so-called] partners guide to the truth[35]?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth.” Who is then more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth, or he who has no guidance unless he himself is guided? What is the matter with you, that you judge so[36]?",
  "footnotes": "[35] Failure of idols is further exposed that they are unable to guide to the straight path.\n [36] How errantly you judge and equate between Allah and your idols?!"
