  "translation": "When hardship befalls man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side, sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he turns a blind eye as though he had never called upon Us to remove his hardship[16]. This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors are made appealing to them.",
  "footnotes": "[16] “When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.” See 41:51."
