  "translation": "It is He Who made the sun a radiant light[7] and the moon a reflected light[8], and precisely determined its phases, so that you may know the number of years and account [of time][9]. Allah has not created all of this except for a true purpose[10]. He makes the signs clear for people who know.",
  "footnotes": "[7] Diyā’ is glowing with glaring light.\n [8] Nūr is reflected light. [9] It provides concrete signs of Allah’s Lordship.\n [10] The wisdom is to lead people to realize the Oneness of Allah."
