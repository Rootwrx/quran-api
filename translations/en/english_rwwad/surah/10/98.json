  "translation": "There had never been any town that believed [after seeing the punishment] and benefited from its faith except the people of Jonah[65]. When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world, and let them enjoy themselves for a while.",
  "footnotes": "[65] An exception to this law was given to the people of Jonah (عليه السلام); their sincere faith delivered them at the very last moment."
