  "translation": "The whole of mankind was but a single community, then they differed[21]. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, a decisive judgment would have been passed between them concerning their differences[22].",
  "footnotes": "[21] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضى الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. Throughout these, people were on the right path of Allah, but then they started disputing [over matters of Faith, i.e., idol worshiping]. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. [Al-Hākim, Al-Mustadrak: 2:546, cf. Al-Tabarī]\n [22] i.e., not to punish anyone before evidence has come to him, or not to judge between them in this life."
