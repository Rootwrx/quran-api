  "translation": "He said, “I have been given all this because of the knowledge that I have.” Did he not know that Allah destroyed some generations before him who were superior to him in power and greater in accumulating [wealth]? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins[35].",
  "footnotes": "[35] Since Allah already knows their sins; they will only be interrogated as a form of censure and rebuke."
