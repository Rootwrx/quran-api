  "translation": "But We brought forth many generations [after Moses], and a long time passed on them[19]. And you [O Prophet] did not dwell among the people of Midian, rehearsing with them Our verses[20], but it is We Who sent you as a messenger [and revealed to you their stories].",
  "footnotes": "[19] So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of Allah over time.\n [20] The Prophet (ﷺ) had no way of knowing these stories except through the revelation from Allah."
