    "translation": "Once he entered the city unnoticed by its people[9], and found two men fighting: one of his own people and the other of his enemies. The one from his own people called him for help against his enemy, so Moses struck him with his fist, causing his death. Moses said, “This is of Satan’s work; he is a sworn enemy who mislead people.”",
    "footnotes": "[9] i.e., as it was the time of rest at noon."
