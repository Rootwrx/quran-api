  "translation": "Indeed, Korah[34] was one of the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had given him such treasures that their keys would weigh down a group of strong men. When his people said to him, “Do not exult, for Allah does not like the exultant.",
  "footnotes": "[34] Korah was Moses’ cousin. Instead of helping his people, he behaved arrogantly toward them."
