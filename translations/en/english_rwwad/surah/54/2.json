  "translation": "Whenever they see a sign[2], they turn away and say, “Same old magic!”",
  "footnotes": "[2] The prophets were given signs or miracles as a proof that they were commissioned by Allah. Moses (عليه السلام) was given the miracles of staff and a bright hand. Jesus (عليه السلام) would give life to the dead and heal the blind and the leper. Muhammad (ﷺ) was given the Qur’an, a literary miracle, challenging the masters of Arabic eloquence. Nonetheless, he (ﷺ) performed other miracles such as splitting the moon, increasing food and water, and healing some ailments."
