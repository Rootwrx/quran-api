  "translation": "The Hour has drawn near and the moon has split asunder[1].",
  "footnotes": "[1] The Quraysh pagans challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) to split the moon in two so that they believe in him. The moon was split as they requested and then re-joined, and the incident was reported by several eyewitnesses in different parts of the land; however, they still refused to believe, considering it magic."
