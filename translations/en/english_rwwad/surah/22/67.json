  "translation": "For every community We ordained ways[35] of worship which they follow, so do not let them dispute with you [O Prophet] in this matter. But call them to your Lord, for you are indeed on the straight guidance.",
  "footnotes": "[35] All prophets came with the same message of worshiping only One God, doing good and shunning evil; nonetheless, each faith-community had their own law."
