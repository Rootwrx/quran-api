  "translation": "Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken besides Him protectors, those who have no power to benefit or harm themselves[15]?” Say, “Can the blind person be equal to the seeing[16], or can the darkness be equal to the light?” Or do they ascribe to Allah partners who created the like of His creation[17], so they are confused between two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.”",
  "footnotes": "[15] The claimed partners cannot be compared to Allah in any way.\n [16] Disbelievers are ‘blind’ to the Truth and the believers can see the Truth plainly as it is.\n [17] Their so-called ‘gods’ could not answer their prayers or do them good or harm, let alone perform such a great act as that of creation."
