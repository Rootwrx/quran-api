    "translation": "Have you not considered the one[155] who argued with Abraham about his Lord, as Allah had given him kingship? When Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who gives life and causes death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” Abraham said, “It is Allah Who brings the sun from the east, so bring it from the west.” Thus the disbeliever was dumbfounded, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people[156].",
    "footnotes": "[155] He is said to be the Biblical King Nimrod. [156] Were they really in search of the Truth, Allah would surely have led them to the right path."
