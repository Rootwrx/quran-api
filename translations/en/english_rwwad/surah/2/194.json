  "translation": "[Battle in] a sacred month[93] is for [aggression committed in] a sacred month, and violations are subject to retribution. So if anyone commits aggression against you, return the aggression against him in the same manner as he showed against you. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.",
  "footnotes": "[93] The sacred months: Dhul-Qi‘dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab."
