    "translation": "Thereafter, if he divorces her [the third time], it is not lawful for him to remarry her until she marries another man[122]. Should he divorce her, then there is no sin on them to return to each other[123], provided that they would maintain the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes clear to people who understand.",
    "footnotes": "[122] With the intention of permanence, not merely in order to return to the previous husband.\n [123] Going back to her earlier husband if the divorce from her subsequent husband is sealed."
