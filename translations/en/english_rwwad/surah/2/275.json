  "translation": "Those who consume usury will not stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except like those being beaten by Satan. That is because they say, “Trade is just like usury[169].” But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever desists because of receiving admonition from his Lord may keep his past gains, and his case is left to Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.",
  "footnotes": "[169] The image given here of a person possessed by the devil staggering while standing and walking unsteadily as they are resurrected for the Day of Judgment. It is a just requital because it mimics their insatiable lust for money in this life, twisting the laws ordained by Allah as they declared lawful what is not."
