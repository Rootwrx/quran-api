  "translation": "O Children of Israel[23], remember My favor that I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant; I will fulfill your covenant[24], and fear none but Me.",
  "footnotes": "[23] Israel is Prophet Jacob (عليه السلام). The use of the epithet ‘Children of Israel’ for the Israelites is to remind them to follow their ancestor from whom they are descended.\n [24] This mutual pledge is as follows: If the Children of Israel keep up the prayer, give zakah, believe in and support the prophets, and spend in the cause of Allah, Allah will, in return, expiate their sins and admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow, i.e., Paradise."
