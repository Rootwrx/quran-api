  "translation": "Divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles[118]. It is not permissible for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs[119] if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have the greater right to take them back within that period[120] if they want reconciliation. Women have rights similar to the rights over them in a reasonable manner, although men have a higher degree [of responsibility] over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[118] Either menstrual periods or periods of purity between menstruation; to ensure that no pregnancy has taken place.\n [119] That is to conceal pregnancy during their waiting period (‘iddah), with the intention of concluding the divorce.\n [120] During the ‘iddah period of a first and second divorce without a new marriage contract."
