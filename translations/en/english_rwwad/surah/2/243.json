    "translation": "Have you not seen those who left their homes, while they were in thousands for fear of death? Then Allah said to them, “Die,” and then He brought them back to life[135]. For Allah is ever Gracious to people, but most people are ungrateful.",
    "footnotes": "[135] In order to show them that they could not escape His Judgment and make them realize that He is capable of bringing about their worst fears, only then to give them their lives back again."
