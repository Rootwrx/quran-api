  "translation": "If the debtor is in hardship, give him respite until it is easy for him to pay back. But if you waive it as charity[171], that is better for you, if only you knew.",
  "footnotes": "[171] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: \"A man used to give loans to the people, and used to say to his servant, ‘If the debtor is poor, forgive him, so that Allah may forgive us.’ When he met Allah (after his death), Allah forgave him.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 687]"
