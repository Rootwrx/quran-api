  "translation": "And fight them wherever you find them[89], and drive them out from where they drove you out[90], for persecution[91] is far worse than fighting. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there. However, if they fight you, then fight them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.",
  "footnotes": "[89] i.e., the disbelievers who raised arms against you. [90] i.e., the land of Makkah from which the Muslims were expelled. [91] Among the meanings of \"fitnah\" are: disbelief and its imposition on others, dissension, trial, and torment."
