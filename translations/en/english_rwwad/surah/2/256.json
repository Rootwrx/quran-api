  "text": "لَآ إِكۡرَاهَ فِي ٱلدِّينِۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ ٱلرُّشۡدُ مِنَ ٱلۡغَيِّۚ فَمَن يَكۡفُرۡ بِٱلطَّٰغُوتِ وَيُؤۡمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱسۡتَمۡسَكَ بِٱلۡعُرۡوَةِ ٱلۡوُثۡقَىٰ لَا ٱنفِصَامَ لَهَاۗ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ",
  "translation": "There is no compulsion in religion[151]; the truth has been made distinct from falsehood. Whoever rejects Tāghoot [152][i.e., false gods] and believes in Allah, has indeed grasped the strong handhold that never breaks[153]. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
  "footnotes": "[151] This is a great Islamic principle whereby no one is to be coerced to believe, but it is the duty of the believers to make sure that people know what is right and what is wrong.\n [152] False objects of worship, such as devils, idols, stones, sun, stars, angels, saints, graves, rulers, etc.\n [153] This verse immediately follows Āyat al-Kursī for good reason, as the previous verse contains clear proofs of the Oneness and Greatness of Allah, which purges Godliness from all that are worshiped besides Allah (Tāghoot)."
