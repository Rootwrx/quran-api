    "translation": "When the example of the son of Mary was given, your people laughed and jeered[22],",
    "footnotes": "[22] When 21:98 was revealed, warning the pagans that all what they worship besides Allah will be in Hell, a poet who was a staunch enemy of Islam, Abdullah ibn az-Ziba‘ra, along with other pagans jeered and laughed arguing that Jesus will be in Hell as well! The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that the verse was talking exclusively about idols, adding that Jesus himself did not ask to be worshiped. Verse 21:101 was later revealed in support of the Prophet declaring that they are exempted."
