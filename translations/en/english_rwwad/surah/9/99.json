  "translation": "However, there are some among the Bedouins who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider what they spend as a means of drawing closer to Allah, and of deserving the invocations of the Messenger. It is certainly a means of drawing closer for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
