  "translation": "The postponement of [Sacred Months] is an act of disbelief[35], which leads them further astray. They declare a month lawful in one year and sacred the next year, in order to match the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, thus making lawful what Allah has made forbidden[36]; their evil deeds have been made appealing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",
  "footnotes": "[35] Fighting during a sacred month.\n [36] If they found it advantageous to violate a sacred month, they would do so, designating another month sacrosanct instead to observe the restrictions of fighting."
