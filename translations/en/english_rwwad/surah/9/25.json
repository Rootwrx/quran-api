  "translation": "Allah has given you victory in many battlefields, and on the day of Hunayn[20] when you took pride in your great number, but they were of no use to you; the earth, despite its vastness, became constricted to you, then you turned back running away.",
  "footnotes": "[20] In the battle of Hunayn, the Prophet (ﷺ) fought along with his noble Companions, when they were certain of victory due to their number and said: “We shall not be defeated today because of our number”, so they were made to suffer retreat."
