    "translation": "Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth, and in return they will have Paradise[82]; they fight in the cause of Allah and they kill or are killed. This is a true promise, given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur’an. Who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice then in the transaction you have made with Him; that is the supreme triumph.",
    "footnotes": "[82] Jābir ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنهما) reported: \"On the day of the battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: \"Can you tell me where I will be if I am martyred?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied: \"In Paradise.\" The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand, and fought till he was martyred.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 377]"
