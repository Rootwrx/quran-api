  "translation": "If it had been an easy win within reach and a short journey, those [hypocrites] would have followed you, but the distance seemed too far for them. They will swear by Allah[43], “If we had been able, we would have surely joined you,” destroying themselves [through false oaths], and Allah knows that they are liars.",
  "footnotes": "[43] When you return from the Tabūk expedition in which the hypocrites did not participate."
