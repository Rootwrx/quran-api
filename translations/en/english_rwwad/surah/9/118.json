  "translation": "[And Allah also turned in mercy to] the three who stayed behind[86], until the earth became constrained to them, despite its vastness, and their souls became a burden to them, and they realized that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy, so that they might repent, for Allah is the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful.",
  "footnotes": "[86] Or whose cases were deferred. They were: Ka‘b ibn Mālik, Hilāl ibn ’Umayyah and Murārah ibn al-Rabī‘, who were sincere Companions but failed to join the Messenger’s (ﷺ) campaign in Tabūk Expedition. When he came back, unlike the hypocrites, they told the truth that they had no excuse. So, the Messenger (ﷺ) imposed a ban on them and forbade people to talk to them. This lasted for fifty nights until this verse was revealed. During this time, they endured huge mental anguish for being ostracized by the whole society. [For further details see: Al-Bukhārī: 4418, and Muslim: 2769]"
