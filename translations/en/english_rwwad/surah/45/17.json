  "translation": "We gave them clear directions in matters [of religion]. They did not differ except after the knowledge had come to them out of transgression against one another[5]. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences.",
  "footnotes": "[5] No community split into factions until there came to them a prophet with divine knowledge; some of them believed and most of them disbelieved out of arrogance and pursuit of worldly benefits."
