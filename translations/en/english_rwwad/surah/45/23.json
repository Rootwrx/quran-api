  "translation": "Have you seen the one who took his whims as his god, and Allah caused him to stray despite having knowledge[6], and sealed up his hearing and heart, and put a cover over his sight? Who can guide him after Allah? Will you not then take heed?",
  "footnotes": "[6] Or Allah’s eternal knowledge of that person's preference for his own inclinations over divine guidance."
