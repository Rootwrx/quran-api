  "translation": "And He gave you of all that you have asked for[24]. If you try to count the blessings of Allah, you cannot count them[25]. Indeed, mankind is truly unjust and ungrateful.",
  "footnotes": "[24] It is not only these grand favors that Allah grants people, but their prayers are also answered, be they uttered or merely wished for.\n [25] If a person were to ever try to count Allah’s blessings on him, he would never be able to count them, let alone be duly grateful for them."
