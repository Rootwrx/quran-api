    "translation": "But an evil word[16] is like an evil tree[17], uprooted from the surface of the earth, having no stability.",
    "footnotes": "[16] i.e., the word of disbelief and polytheism.\n [17] i.e., the tree of colocynth; it has no stable root and its stalks are so feeble; such is disbelief which is shaky in the heart, and their deeds are not raised to benefit them in the Hereafter."
