  "translation": "We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign[19] and sheltered them on a hillside – a place of rest and a flowing stream[20].",
  "footnotes": "[19] The miraculous birth of Jesus is clear proof of Allah's Omnipotence that Mary gave birth to him without male interference.\n [20] Other Prophets were rejected for being human beings; whereas, people went to two extremes regarding Jesus: some considered him as divine, while some others went to the other extreme by accusing Mary of unchastity, although they were witnesses of the miraculous birth of Jesus and had heard him speak in the cradle."
