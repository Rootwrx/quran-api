  "translation": "Who created seven heavens one above another; you will not see any imperfection[1] in the creation of the Most Compassionate. Look again; can you see any flaw?",
  "footnotes": "[1] All parts of the universe are well connected and in perfect harmony and coordination. There is no indiscipline, disorder and discordance in the universe, and nothing is disjointed and out of proportion in the creation of Allah. As for birth defects, genetic mutations and other things that we see in the world are part of this great creation, for perfection cannot be noticed except if the opposite is seen, also as a test for humans."
