    "translation": "So be patient, as the Messengers of Firm Resolve[15] were patient, and do not seek to hasten [punishment] for them. On the Day when they see what they were warned of, it will be as if they had only stayed [in this world] for an hour of a day[16]. This is a warning. Will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?",
    "footnotes": "[15] They are Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all).\n [16] i.e., for a short period of time."
