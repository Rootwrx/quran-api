  "translation": "And [remember, O Prophet] when you were saying to the one[30] who was favored by Allah[31] and favored by you[32], “Keep your wife and fear Allah.” You were concealing in your heart what Allah was going to reveal[33], and you were fearing people[34], while it was more fitting that you should fear Allah[35]. When Zayd no longer had desire for her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no restraint for the believers in marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have desire for them. And Allah’s decree is bound to be fulfilled.",
  "footnotes": "[30] It refers to the Prophet's adopted son, Zayd ibn Hārithah, before the adoption was abolished.\n [31] By guiding him to Islam.\n [32] By emancipating him from bondage.\n [33] i.e., the command of Allah to the Prophet (ﷺ) to marry Zaynab bint Jahsh after Zayd divorced her; in order to make clear to people that a man can marry a woman previously married to his adopted son.\n [34] i.e., fear that people may say that he married the former wife of his adopted son.\n [35] By making Allah’s command known to people."
