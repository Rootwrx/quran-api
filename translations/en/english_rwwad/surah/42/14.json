  "translation": "They did not become divided except after the knowledge had come to them[10], out of envious rivalry between them. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord until an appointed term[11], a decisive judgment would already have been passed between them. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture[12] after them are in disquieting doubt about it.",
  "footnotes": "[10] No community split into factions except after receiving the knowledge given to them by their prophet, out of transgression and obstinacy towards the truth.\n [11] That He will delay their punishment to the judgment Day.\n [12] i.e., the Jews and the Christians."
