    "translation": "Therefore call to that [religion, O Prophet] and keep to the straight path as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in every Scripture that Allah has sent down, and I have been commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds[13]. Let there be no [further] argument between us and you[14]; Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the final return.”",
    "footnotes": "[13] i.e., the consequences thereof.\n [14] Since the truth and falsehood have become clear, but those who refuse the truth do so only out of obstinacy or pursuing worldly interests."
