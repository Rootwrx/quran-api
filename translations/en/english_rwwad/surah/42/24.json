  "translation": "Or do they say, “He has fabricated lies about Allah[18]!”? But if Allah willed, He could seal up your heart[19]. Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",
  "footnotes": "[18] While they are certain of his truthfulness and honesty.\n [19] Allah could seal up the whole message by sealing up his heart; then he would not understand anything, so the whole message would then stop if He so willed."
