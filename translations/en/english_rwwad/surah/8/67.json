  "translation": "It is not befitting for a prophet to take captives[41] until he thoroughly subdues [the enemy] in the land. You desire the gains of this world[42], but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[41] It is referring to the disbelievers of Quraysh who were taken as captives by the Prophet (ﷺ) in the wake of Badr.\n [42] i.e., material benefits, such as the ransom paid by prisoners."
