  "translation": "If you [disbelievers] were seeking the decision, it has come to you[9]. If you desist, it will be better for you, but if you return [to war], We too will return. And your forces – no matter how great in number they are – will not avail you anything, for Allah is with the believers.",
  "footnotes": "[9] The disbelievers implored Allah against Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and Muslims (alleging that they were wrongdoers), so His decision came."
