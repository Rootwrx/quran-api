  "footnotes": "[12] A better life with faith both in this life and in the Hereafter.\n [13] Beware of rejecting the command of Allah when it comes to you, for Allah may not enable you to respond to his command afterward, as the hearts are between the two Fingers of Allah Who changes it as He wishes."
