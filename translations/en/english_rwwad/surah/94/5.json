    "footnotes": "[4] In Arabic grammar, if a definite noun is repeated, it is referring to the same thing. However, if an indefinite noun is repeated, it is referring to two different things. So here in this and the coming verse they refer to one hardship (a definite noun) and two eases (an indefinite noun), which manifests Allah's favors upon His servants even in times of hardships."
