    "translation": "They assign to Allah a portion of the crops and livestock He created, saying, “This is for Allah” – as they claim – “and this is for our partners [i.e., idols].” But that which is assigned for their partners does not reach Allah, while that which is assigned for Allah reaches their partners[44]. How unfair their judgment is!",
    "footnotes": "[44] It was an Arab heathen ritual to allocate two shares out of their livestock; a share for God and a share for idols. If a portion of God’s share was mixed with that of their idols, they would not deduct it, saying that God is in no need of it. Yet if a portion of their idols’ share fell with that of God’s they would readily cut it and add it on to their idols’ share."
