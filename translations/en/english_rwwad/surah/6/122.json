    "translation": "Is the one who was dead and We gave him life [by faith] and gave him a light with which he walks among people like the one in darkness from which he can never escape[40]? This is how the deeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.",
    "footnotes": "[40] The simile given here is about someone who is guided by light of guidance and someone who is bereft of the light of guidance."
