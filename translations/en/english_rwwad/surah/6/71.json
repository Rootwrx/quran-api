  "translation": "Say, “Shall we invoke[22] besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm us, and shall we turn back to disbelief after being guided by Allah? Just like the one whom devils have tempted in the land leaving him bewildered, although he has companions inviting him to guidance[23], “Come to us.” Say, “Allah’s guidance is the [true] guidance, and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds,",
  "footnotes": "[22] i.e., worship.\n [23] The example given is of one who lost his way and is further confused by evil ones, tempting him to follow various directions, all leading to destruction; although his sincere friends call him to the right direction, but he ignores them."
