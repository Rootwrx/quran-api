    "translation": "Has your Lord favored you with sons and has taken for Himself angels as daughters[37]? You are indeed making a monstrous claim.",
    "footnotes": "[37] Their feeble argument is debunked and refuted concerning the issue of purity of Faith and Monotheism. Although preferring male over female is a heathen way; yet, how would Allah, the Omnipotent Creator, accept for Himself what they do not accept for themselves? (cf. 37:149-155). They worshiped the angels based on the claim that they were Allah’s daughters. (cf. 43:19-20)."
