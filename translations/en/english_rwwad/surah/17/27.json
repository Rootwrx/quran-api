  "footnotes": "[24] Islam is a religion of moderation and good consideration; neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderate.\n [25] Disbelievers are the most ungrateful ones as they rebel against Allah's commands instead of showing obedience to Him, for they follow the way of the devil towards Allah."
