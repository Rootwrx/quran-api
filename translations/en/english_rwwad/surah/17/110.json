  "text": "قُلِ ٱدۡعُواْ ٱللَّهَ أَوِ ٱدۡعُواْ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنَۖ أَيّٗا مَّا تَدۡعُواْ فَلَهُ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءُ ٱلۡحُسۡنَىٰۚ وَلَا تَجۡهَرۡ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتۡ بِهَا وَٱبۡتَغِ بَيۡنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلٗا",
  "translation": "Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate[87] – whichever name you call, to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not be too loud in your prayer, nor too quiet, but seek a way in between[88].",
  "footnotes": "[87] The Makkans heard the Prophet (ﷺ) praying to Allah, once as Allah and on another occasion as Al-Rahmān, and claimed that he was praying to two different gods. [Majmū‘ al-Fatāwā, Ibn Taymiyyah, 14:15] Both are two Names for Allah, the One and Only God.\n [88] Abdullāh ibn Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported the reason behind the revelation of this verse: “It came down when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was lying low in Makkah. When he used to lead his Companions in Prayer and raise his voice and the pagans heard him, they would curse the Qur’an and He Who sent it down. So Allah said to His Messenger: “Do not raise your voice is Prayer upon which the pagans would hear you, yet not too quiet that your Companions may not hear you. Make them hear the Qur’an but do not raise your voice to that extent; seeking a middle way between them.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4722; Muslim: 446]."
