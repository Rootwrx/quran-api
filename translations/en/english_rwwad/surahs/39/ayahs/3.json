  "translation": "Indeed, sincere devotion is due to Allah alone[1]. As for those who take others as guardians besides Him, [saying], “We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to Allah.” Allah will judge between them[2] concerning that over which they differ. Allah does not guide anyone who is a liar and a persistent disbeliever.",
  "footnotes": "[1] i.e., He only accepts sincere worship and obedience.\n [2] i.e., between those who were devoted to Allah alone and those who associated partners with Him."
