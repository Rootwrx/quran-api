  "translation": "They will say, “All praise be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us inherit the land[22] to dwell wherever we please in Paradise.” How excellent is the reward of those who do [good]!",
  "footnotes": "[22] Allah will award Paradise to the believers to be its residents forever. See 21:105. Some commentators say that the word “inherit” is used because when Allah created Paradise and Hell, He made places for all humans in both. Those who go to Paradise will inherit the places of the disbelievers who go to Hell, and those who go to Hell will inherit the places of those who go to Paradise."
