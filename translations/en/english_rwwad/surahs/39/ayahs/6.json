  "translation": "He created you from a single soul[3], then He made from it its mate[4], and He created for you eight types of livestock[5]. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers [in stages], creation after creation, in three layers of darkness[6]. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the dominion; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. So how are you averted?",
  "footnotes": "[3] i.e., Adam. [4] i.e., Eve. [5] The eight types of livestock: (four males and females): a pair of sheep, a pair of goats, a pair of camels, and a pair of oxen. See 6:143-144.\n [6] These three layers: the belly, the womb, and the amniotic membrane."
