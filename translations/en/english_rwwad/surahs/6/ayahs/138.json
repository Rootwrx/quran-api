  "translation": "They say, “These livestock and crops are reserved, none may eat them except those[46] whom we wish,” – as they claim – and there are livestock whose backs are forbidden [from labor][47], and livestock over whom they do not mention the name of Allah [while slaughtering] – fabricating lies against Him[48]. He will punish them for their lies.",
  "footnotes": "[46] i.e., the servants of idols and others.\n [47] The four categories of grazing livestock were dedicated to their idols and false deities, and they were forbidden from riding and labor. See 5:103.\n [48] i.e., false claims that these practices are part of Allah’s religion."
