  "translation": "Has he fabricated a lie against Allah, or is he mad?”[5] No, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment, and they are extremely misguided.",
  "footnotes": "[5] People knew that the Prophet (ﷺ) was the most truthful person, as he was known to be the wisest person among them too; so Allah did not refute these two baseless accusations; rather, He only made mention of their consequence of denying the life after death."
