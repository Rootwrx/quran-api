  "translation": "Indeed, We have given you [O Prophet] a clear conquest[1],",
  "footnotes": "[1] This surah takes its name \"Surah al-Fath\" (Surah of Conquest) from the clear conquest mentioned in this verse. This treaty was signed in 6 A.H./628 C.E. Ibn Mas‘ūd said, \"You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah.\" Al-Barā’ bin ‘Āzib said something similar to this as reported by Al-Bukhāri. Although the companions initially regarded this treaty as a setback, yet in effect, it helped promote the spread of Islam, as thousands of people from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. This treaty was in fact a precursor to the conquest of Makkah two years later."
