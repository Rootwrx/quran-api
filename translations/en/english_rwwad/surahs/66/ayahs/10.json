  "translation": "Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous slaves, but they betrayed them[3]. Their husbands could not avail them anything against Allah, and they both were told, “Enter the Fire along with those who enter!”",
  "footnotes": "[3] In the matter of religion, for they both were disbelievers."
