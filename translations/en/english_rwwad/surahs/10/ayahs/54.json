  "translation": "If every wrongdoer were to possess all that is on earth, he would surely offer it to ransom himself. They will hide their remorse[46] when they see the punishment. They will be judged in all fairness, and they will not be wronged.",
  "footnotes": "[46] Profound remorse and sorrow is a type of self-punishment, which is not less severe than imposed punishment."
