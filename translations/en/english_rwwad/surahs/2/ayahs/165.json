  "translation": "And among people, there are some who take others as equals to Allah[72]: they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers could see the punishment, they would surely realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[72] In spite of all these clear signs, some people still worship false deities besides Allah."
