  "translation": "As for the woman and the man who commit fornication; flog each of them a hundred lashes. Do not let pity for them make you lenient concerning the law of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment[1].",
  "footnotes": "[1] Fornication has to be proven either by confession or the testimony of four reliable witnesses to having actually seen the act take place. This ruling is applicable to unmarried fornicators. Execution by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for married adulterers."
