  "translation": "Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will make them successors in the land, as He made those who came before them, and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and He will surely change their state of fear into security; that they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves[33] after that, it is they who are the rebellious.",
  "footnotes": "[33] i.e., denies Allah's favor or does not live by His ordinance."
