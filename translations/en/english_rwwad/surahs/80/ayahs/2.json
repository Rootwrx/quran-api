  "translation": "when the blind man came to him[1].",
  "footnotes": "[1] Abdullah ibn Um Maktūm, an early Muslim who was blind, came to the Prophet (ﷺ) seeking to learn, while the Prophet (ﷺ) was in the middle of a discussion with a leading pagan of Makkah, calling him to Islam. Abdullah was so impatient that he interrupted their discussion. The Prophet (ﷺ) frowned and turned his attention to that pagan. So this Makkan surah was revealed, telling the Prophet (ﷺ) that the faithful blind man was more worthy of attention than that disbeliever."
