  "translation": "When you see them, their outward appearance pleases you, and when they speak, you listen to what they say. But they are like planks of wood leaned [against the wall][1]. They deem every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?",
  "footnotes": "[1] They are like bodies with empty minds and hearts."
