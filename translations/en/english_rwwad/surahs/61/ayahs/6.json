  "translation": "And [remember] when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Children of Israel, I am truly a messenger of Allah to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving glad tidings of a messenger after me whose name will be Ahmad[1].” But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is clear magic.”",
  "footnotes": "[1] Another name of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Both are derived from \"hamd\" which means praise. Some scholars believe that this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete, to be with you forever.” Paraclete in Greek means ‘the praised one.’ Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) name is mentioned several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which the Christian authorities deem as apocryphal Bible."
