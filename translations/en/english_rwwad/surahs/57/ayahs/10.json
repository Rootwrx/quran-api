  "translation": "Why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when Allah alone will inherit the heavens and earth? Those of you who spent and fought before the conquest [of Makkah and those who did not] are not equal. They are much greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterward[9]. Yet Allah has promised each a fine reward, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
  "footnotes": "[9] Muslims were perceived as weak before the conquest of Makkah. Therefore, those believers who donated and fought in times of weakness and hardship deserve more rewards than those who did so when Muslims were victors and had an upper hand against the enemies."
