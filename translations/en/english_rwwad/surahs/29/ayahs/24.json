  "translation": "His people’s only response was to say, “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire[6]. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe.",
  "footnotes": "[6] The people of Abraham tried to burn him because he called them to worship Allah alone without associating others with Him; eventually, he smashed their idols. For the full story see 21:51-71."
