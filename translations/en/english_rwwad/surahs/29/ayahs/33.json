  "translation": "When Our angel-messengers came to Lot, he was distressed by their coming and felt troubled on their account[10], but they said, “Do not fear nor grieve; we will surely save you and your family, except your wife; she is one of those who will remain behind.”",
  "footnotes": "[10] Because they came in the form of handsome men, so Prophet Lot was worried for the dignity of his guests from his wicked people."
