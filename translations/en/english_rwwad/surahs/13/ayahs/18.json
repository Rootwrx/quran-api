  "translation": "Those who respond to their Lord will have the best reward[19]. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess all that is on earth and the likes thereof, they would surely offer it to ransom themselves; they will have the worst reckoning[20], and their abode will be Hell. What a terrible resting place!",
  "footnotes": "[19] al-Husnā (lit. the best reward) is a good reward in this life and Paradise in the Hereafter.\n [20] Their good deeds will not be accepted from them and they will be asked about their minute misdeeds."
