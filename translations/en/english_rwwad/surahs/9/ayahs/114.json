  "translation": "As for the prayer of Abraham for his father’s forgiveness, it was only because of a promise he had made to him. However, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him[84]. Indeed, Abraham was tender-hearted and forbearing.",
  "footnotes": "[84] This prohibition is not exclusive to Islam as it has been in effect since the time of Abraham (عليه السلام)"
