  "translation": "Those who disparage the believers who voluntarily give charities and ridicule them for having nothing to give except their effort[63]. Allah will ridicule them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[63] They hurtle sneering comments on both the well-off who give generously, saying that they do so out of show off, and those who can only help with the very little they have, and deride them for it."
