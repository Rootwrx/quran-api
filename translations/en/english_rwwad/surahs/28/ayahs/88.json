  "translation": "Do not invoke with Allah another god; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. Everything will perish except His Face[38]. His is the Judgment and to Him you will all be brought back.",
  "footnotes": "[38] i.e., except Himself. The commentators have two interpretations here: 1. that Allah is Permanent and Eternal, for everything will perish except Himself. 2. that everything will perish except what is done for the sake (Face) of Allah."
