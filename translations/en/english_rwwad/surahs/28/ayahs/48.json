  "translation": "But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses before[21].” Did they not reject what was given to Moses before? They say, “Both [revelations] are works of magic, supporting each other”, adding, “We truly reject both of them[22].”",
  "footnotes": "[21] The pagans of Makkah demanded that the Qur’an should have been revealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) should have brought us tangible miracles like Moses’ staff, illuminating hand, etc.\n [22] It refers to the pagans of Makkah concerning the Qur’an and the Torah."
