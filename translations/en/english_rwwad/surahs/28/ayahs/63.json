  "translation": "Those against whom the word will be fulfilled[30] will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray; we led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We disassociate ourselves [from them] before You; it was not us that they used to worship[31].”",
  "footnotes": "[30] i.e., the disbelievers upon whom the decree of punishment has been passed.\n [31] i.e., We did not force them, nor did they obey us; rather, they obeyed their own desires."
