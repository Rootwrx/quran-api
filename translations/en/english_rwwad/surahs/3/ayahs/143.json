  "translation": "You did wish for martyrdom[62] before facing it, and now you have seen it with your own eyes.",
  "footnotes": "[62] This is a reminder to the believers, who missed the Battle of Badr, of their talk about wishing to meet the enemy and being martyred. The Battle of Uhud is being alluded to here, as solid intentions and steadfastness are what actually win battles, not mere fancy talk."
