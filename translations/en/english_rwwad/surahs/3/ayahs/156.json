  "translation": "O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers who traveled through the land or engaged in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed[72].” Allah makes that a cause of distress in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and causes death, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
  "footnotes": "[72] A believer should know for certain that all matters, including life and death, are in the Hands of Allah alone."
