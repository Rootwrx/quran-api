  "translation": "In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham[44]; whoever enters it will be safe. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to Allah upon all people who are able to make their way to it; whoever disbelieves, then Allah is in no need for the worlds[45].",
  "footnotes": "[44] It is the stone on which Abraham (عليه السلام) stood while building the Ka‘ba. It is an everlasting sign of the relationship of Islam to Abraham’s creed. [45] He is in no need for His servants’ worship; it is they who are in need of Him."
