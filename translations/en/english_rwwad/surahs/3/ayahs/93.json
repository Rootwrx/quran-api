  "translation": "All food was permissible for the Children of Israel except what Israel [i.e., Jacob] made impermissible for himself[41] before the Torah was sent down. Say, “Bring the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful.”",
  "footnotes": "[41] Israel (Jacob) became very ill and his illness dragged on for a long time, then he vowed that he would make unlawful for himself the drink and food he loved most should Allah cure him. The best food for him was camel meat and the drink he loved most was camel milk."
