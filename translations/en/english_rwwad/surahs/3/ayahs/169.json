  "translation": "Never think of those who are killed in Allah’s way as dead; rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision[80],",
  "footnotes": "[80] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “When your brothers were killed in the Battle of Badr, Allah placed their souls in the (abdominal) cavities of green fowls, drinking from the rivers of Paradise, eating from its fruits and coming back at the end of the day to repose in chandeliers hung in the Shadow of the Majestic Throne. For all of this, they said: “Who would tell our brothers about us; that we are in Paradise being provided for so that they may not give up fighting in the way of Allah or cower in war?” Allah Almighty said: “I will tell them on your behalf”. Then He revealed: “Do not think that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead. Nay but they are alive with their Lord being provided for”. [Abū Dāwūd: 2520, Ahmad: 2388; another version is found in Muslim: 1887]"
