  "translation": "Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, “Bring your proof. Here is the Book of those who are with me, and the Book of those who came before me[12].” Yet most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away.",
  "footnotes": "[12] The Prophet (ﷺ) is addressed to challenge the pagans to produce their proof for the existence of other gods; whereas, the Qur’an, the Torah, and the Gospel are in agreement that there is no god but Allah alone."
