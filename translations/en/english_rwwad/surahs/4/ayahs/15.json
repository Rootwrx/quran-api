  "translation": "Those of your women who commit adultery, call four witnesses against them[12] from amongst you. If they testify, confine them to their homes until they die or Allah ordains for them [another] way[13].",
  "footnotes": "[12] The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.\n [13] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the verse of Surat an-Nūr (24:2), ordaining lashing for the unmarried and stoning to death for the married."
