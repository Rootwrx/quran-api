  "translation": "And We raised above them the Mount [to remind them] of their covenant, and We said to them, “Enter the gate [of Jerusalem] lowering your heads[104]”, and said to them: “Do not break the Sabbath”, and We took from them a solemn covenant.",
  "footnotes": "[104] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"It was said to Bani Israel, ‘Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility and say: ‘Repentance’, but they changed the word and entered crawling on their buttocks and said: ‘A wheat grain in the hair’.\" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 615]. They said so just to ridicule Allah’s order, as they were disobedient to Him. So Allah punished them severely, most probably with a plague."
