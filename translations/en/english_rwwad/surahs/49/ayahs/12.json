  "translation": "O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, for some suspicions are sin. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother[6]? You would surely abhor it. So fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
  "footnotes": "[6] Backbiting people is likened to eating their dead bodies, for the dead do not feel the pain if their flesh is eaten; likewise, the one who is absent does not feel the pain of backbiting. So, backbiting someone is like eating his flesh while he is dead."
