  "footnotes": "[1] Khawlah bint Tha‘labah and her husband Aws ibn As-Sāmit had a disagreement. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that her husband made her unlawful to himself as the zahr (back) of his mother, which was a famous type of divorce in Arabia, called zihār. He (ﷺ) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard. Finally, this Madinian surah was revealed, and abolished this ancient practice."
