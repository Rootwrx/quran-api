  "translation": "(19) And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he[1098] said, \"O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders.\"",
  "footnotes": "[1098]- i.e., the Israelite, thinking that Moses meant to strike him.  Some commentators have attributed the words to the Copt; however, the Israelite was the only one who knew of the previous occurrence."
