  "translation": "(29) And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, \"Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.\"",
