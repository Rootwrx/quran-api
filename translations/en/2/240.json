  "translation": "(240) And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - for their wives is a bequest: maintenance for one year without turning [them] out. But if they leave [of their own accord], then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way.[96] And Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[96]- This directive was abrogated by those later revealed in 2:234 and 4:12."
