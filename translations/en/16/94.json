  "translation": "(94) And do not take your oaths as [means of] deceit between you, lest a foot slip after it was [once] firm, and you would taste evil [in this world] for what [people] you diverted from the way of Allāh,[714] and you would have [in the Hereafter] a great punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[714]- Referring to those who would be dissuaded from Islām as a result of a Muslim's deceit and treachery."
