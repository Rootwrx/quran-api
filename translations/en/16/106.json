  "translation": "(106) Whoever disbelieves in [i.e., denies] Allāh after his belief...[716] except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from Allāh, and for them is a great punishment;",
  "footnotes": "[716]- Based upon the conclusion of this verse, the omitted phrase concerning the apostate is understood to be \"...has earned the wrath of Allāh...\""
