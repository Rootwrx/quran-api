  "translation": " 18. For those who answered their Lord’s Call [believed in the Oneness of Allâh and followed His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم i.e. Islâmic Monotheism] is Al-Husnâ (i.e. Paradise). But those who answered not His Call (disbelieved in the Oneness of Allâh and followed not His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), if they had all that is in the earth together with its like, they would offer it in order to save themselves (from the torment, but it will be in vain). For them there will be the terrible reckoning. Their dwelling-place will be Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.[2]",
