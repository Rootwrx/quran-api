(And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allâh benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and irrigating the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allâh’s religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah عز وجل has revealed through me (the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) and learns and then teaches it to others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allâh’s Guidance revealed through me: (He is like that barren land).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadîth No.79).\nB. Guidance is of two kinds:\na) Guidance of Taufîq and it is totally from Allâh, i.e. Allâh opens one’s heart to receive the truth (from disbelief to Belief in Islamic Monotheism).\nb) Guidance of Irshâd i.e. through preaching by Allâh’s Messengers and pious preachers who preach the truth i.e. Islamic Monotheism."
