  "translation": " 9. Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)[2].",
  "footnotes": "(V.15:9) This Verse is a challenge to mankind and everyone is obliged to believe in the miracles of this Qur’ân. It is a clear fact that more than 1400 years have elapsed and not a single word of this Qur’ân has been changed, although the disbelievers tried their utmost to change it in every way, but they failed miserably in their efforts. As it is mentioned in this holy Verse: \"We will guard it.\" By Allâh! He has guarded it. On the contrary, all the other holy Books [the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel).] have been corrupted in the form of additions or subtractions or alterations in the original text."
