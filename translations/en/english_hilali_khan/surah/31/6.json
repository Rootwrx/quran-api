    "translation": " 6. And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allâh without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allâh, or the Verses of the Qur’ân) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).[2]",
    "footnotes": "(V.31:6) What is said regarding the one who regards an alcoholic drink lawful to drink, and calls it by another name.\nNarrated Abu ‘Âmir or Abu Malik Al-Ash‘ari that he heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: \"From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and the use of musical instruments as lawful. And (from them), there will be some who will stay near the side of a mountain, and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him: ‘Return to us tomorrow.’ Allâh will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs; and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Hadith No. 494B)."
