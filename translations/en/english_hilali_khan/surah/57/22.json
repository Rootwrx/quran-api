    "footnotes": "(V.57:22) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbas رضي الله عنهما : Once I was behind the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and he said: \"O boy, I will teach you a few words:\n(a) Be loyal and obedient to Allâh [worship Him (Alone)], remember Him always, obey His Orders. He will save you from every evil and will take care of you in all the spheres of life.\n(b) Be loyal and obedient to Allâh, you will find Him near (in front of you) i.e. He will respond to your requests.\n(c) If you ask, ask Allâh.\n(d) If you seek help, seek help from Allâh.\n(e) Know that if all the people get together in order to benefit you with something, they will not be able to benefit you in anything except what Allâh has decreed for you. And if they all get together in order to harm you with something, they will not be able to harm you in anything except what Allâh has decreed for you.\nThe pens have stopped writings [Divine (Allâh’s) Preordainments]. And (the ink over) the papers (Book of Decrees) has dried.\" [This Hadith is quoted in Sahih At-Tirmidhi].\n"
