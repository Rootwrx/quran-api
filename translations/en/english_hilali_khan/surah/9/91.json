  "translation": " 91. There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to spend [in holy fighting (Jihâd)], if they are sincere and true (in duty) to Allâh and His Messenger.[1] No ground (of complaint) can there be against the Muhsinûn (good-doers - See the footnote of V.9:120). And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
