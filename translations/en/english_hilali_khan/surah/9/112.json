    "translation": " 112. (The believers whose lives Allâh has purchased are) those who turn to Allâh in repentance (from polytheism and hypocrisy, etc.), who worship (Him), who praise (Him), who fast (or go out in Allâh’s Cause), who bow down (in prayer), who prostrate themselves (in prayer), who enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all what Islâm has ordained) and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds and all that Islâm has forbidden), and who observe the limits set by Allâh (do all that Allâh has ordained and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allâh has forbidden). And give glad tidings to the believers.[1]",
    "footnotes": "(V.9:112) Narrated Sahl bin Sa‘d: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever can guarantee (the chastity of) what is between his two jaw-bones and what is between his two legs (i.e., his mouth, tongue and his private parts)*. I guarantee Paradise for him.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.481)\n* i.e. whoever protects his tongue from illegal talk e.g., to tell lies, or backbiting, etc., and his mouth from eating and drinking forbidden illegal things, and his private parts from illegal sexual acts."
