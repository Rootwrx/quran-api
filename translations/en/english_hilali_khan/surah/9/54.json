  "translation": " 54. And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and that they came not to As-Salât (the prayer) except in a lazy state,[2] and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.",
  "footnotes": "(V.9:54) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"No Salât (prayer) is more heavy (harder) for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Ishâ prayer; but if they knew the reward for these Salât (prayers) at their respective times, they would certainly, present themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to crawl.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"Certainly, I intended (or was about) to order the Mu‘adhdhin (call-maker) to pronounce Iqâmah and order a man to lead the Salât (prayer), and then take a fire flame to burn all those (men along with their houses) who had not yet left their houses for the Salât (prayer) (in the mosques).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No. 626)."
