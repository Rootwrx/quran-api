Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"By Him (Allâh) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.\" (Sahih Muslim, the Book of Faith, Vol. 1, Chapter No.240). See also (V.3:85) and (V.3:116)."
