  "footnotes": "(V.111:1) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما : \"When the Verse, ‘And warn your tribe (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near kindred.’ (V.26:214) was revealed, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم went out, and when he had ascended As-Safâ mountain, he shouted, ‘Yâ Sabâhâh !’* The people said, ‘What is that?’ Then they gathered around him, whereupon he said, ‘Do you see? If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?’ They said, ‘We have never heard you telling a lie.’ Then he said, ‘I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.’ Abû Lahab said, ‘May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason?’ Then Abu Lahab went away. So [Sûrat Al-Masad] ‘Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!’ was revealed. (V.111:1). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadith No.495).\n* \"Yâ Sabâhâh!\" is an Arabic expression used when one appeals for help or draws the attention of others to some danger."
