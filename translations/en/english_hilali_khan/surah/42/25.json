    "footnotes": "(V.42:25)\nNarrated Shaddâd bin Aus رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \" The most superior way of asking for forgiveness from Allah is: Allâhumma anta Rabbî, lâ ilâha illâ Anta. Anta khalaqtanî wa ana ‘abduka, wa ana ‘alâ ‘ahdika wa wa‘dika mastata‘tu. A‘ûdhu bika min sharri ma sana‘tu, Abû’u laka bi ni‘matika ‘alaiya, wa abû’u laka bi dhanbi faghfirlî fa innahu lâ yaghfiru dhdhunûba illâ Anta ’\" * The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added: \"If somebody recites it during the day with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No.318).\n* O Allah, You are my Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You."
