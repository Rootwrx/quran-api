  "translation": "45. And you will see them brought forward to it (Hell) made humble by disgrace,[1] (and) looking with stealthy glance. And those who believe will say: \"Verily, the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, the Zâlimûn [i.e. Al-Kâfirûn (disbelievers in Allâh, in His Oneness and in His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم, polytheists, wrong-doers)] will be in a lasting torment. (Tafsir At-Tabari).",
  "footnotes": "(V.42:45) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: A man said, \"O Allah’s Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Will Allah gather a disbeliever prone on his face on the Day of Resurrection?\" He صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Will not the One Who made him walk on his feet in this world, be able to make him walk on his face on the Day of Resurrection?\" (Qatâdah, a subnarrator, said : \"Yes, by the Power of Our Lord!\") (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.283)."
