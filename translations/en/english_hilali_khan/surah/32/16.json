  "footnotes": "(V.32:16) Narrated Mu‘âdh bin Jabal رضي الله عنه: The Prophet (Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم) said to him: \"May I show you the gates of goodness? (They are): (1) Fasting is a screen from Hell. (2) As-Sadaqâh (deeds of charity in Allâh’s Cause) extinguishes (removes) the sins, as the water extinguishes the fire. (3) Standing in Salât (performing of prayers) by a person during the middle (or the last third) part of a night.\" Then Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم recited: \"Their sides forsake their beds.\" (V.32:16) (Abu Dâwûd and Tirmidhi) (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubî)."
