    "translation": " 12. (It will be said): \"This is because, when Allâh Alone was invoked (in worship) you disbelieved (denied), but when partners were joined to Him, you believed! So the judgement is only with Allâh, the Most High, the Most Great![1]\"",
    "footnotes": "(V.40:12) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: \"The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said one statement and I said another. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allâh as a rival to Allâh, will enter Hell (Fire).\" And I said, ‘Whoever dies without invoking anything as a rival to Allâh, will enter Paradise.’\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadith No. 24)."
