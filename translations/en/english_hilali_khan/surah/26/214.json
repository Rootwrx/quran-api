  "translation": " 214. And warn your tribe (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near kindred.[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.26:214) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: When the Verse: \"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near kindred.\" (V.26:214) was revealed, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم went out, and when he had ascended As-Safa mountain, he shouted, \"Yâ Sabâhâh!*\" The people said, \"Who is that?\" \"Then they gathered around him, whereupon he said, \"Do you see? If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?\" They said, \"We have never heard you telling a lie.\" Then he said, \"I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.\" Abû Lahab said: \"May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason?\" Then Abû Lahab went away. So Sûrat Al-Masad \"Perish the hands of Abû Lahab!\" (V.111:1) was revealed. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.495).\n* \"Yâ Sabâhâh!\" is an Arabic expression used when one appeals for help or draws the attention of others to some danger."
