    "translation": " 121. Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allâh’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allâh). And certainly, the Shayâtîn (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them[1] [by making Al-Maitah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikûn (polytheists); [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allâh has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them; and to worship others besides Allâh is polytheism].",
    "footnotes": "(V.6:121) Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Jarîr: Once while Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was reciting the Verse (9:31) ‘Adî bin Hâtim said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! They do not worship them (i.e., rabbis and monks).\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"They certainly do. They (i.e., rabbis and monks) made lawful things as unlawful, and unlawful things as lawful, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them; and by doing so, they really worshipped them.\" (Tafsir At-Tabari )."
