  "footnotes": "(V.19:39) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, death will be brought forward in the shape of a black and white ram. Then a call-maker will call, ‘O people of Paradise!’ Thereupon they will stretch their necks and look carefully. The caller will say, ‘Do you know this?’ They will say: ‘Yes, this is death.’ By then all of them would have seen it. Then it will be announced again, ‘O people of Hell!’ They will stretch their necks and look carefully. The caller will say, ‘Do you know this?’ They will say, ‘Yes, this is death.’ \" And by then all of them would have seen it. Then it (that ram) will be slaughtered and the caller will say. ‘O people of Paradise! Eternity for you and no death. O people of Hell! Eternity for you and no death.’ Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم recited: \"And warn them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of the Day of grief and regrets when the case has been decided, while (now) they (i.e. the people of the world) are in a state of carelessness and they believe not.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No. 254)."
