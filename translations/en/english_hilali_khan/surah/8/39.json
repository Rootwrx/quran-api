  "translation": " 39. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world[1]]. But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allâh), then certainly, Allâh is All-Seer of what they do.[2]",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.8:39) It is mentioned by some of the Islâmic religious scholars that, that will be at the time when ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليهما السلام, will descend on the earth, and he will not accept any other religion except Islâm - The True Religion of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism).\n[2] (V.8:39)\nA) See the footnote of (V.2:193).\nB) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"By Him (Allâh) in whose Hand my soul is, surely, the son of Maryam (Mary) [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] عليهما السلامwill shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims), and will judge mankind justly by the Law of the Qur’ân (as a just ruler), and will break the cross and kill the pigs and abolish the Jizyah [a tax taken from the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) who are under the protection of a Muslim government. This Jizyah tax will not be accepted by ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام and all mankind will be required to embrace Islâm with no other alternative]. Then there will be abundance of money and nobody will accept charitable gifts.\" (See Fath Al-Bari, Vol. 7, Pages No.304 and 305 for details). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.3 Hadîth No.425)."
