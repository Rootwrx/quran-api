    "translation": " 103. And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allâh (i.e. this Qur’ân), and be not divided among yourselves[1], and remember Allâh’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islâmic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allâh makes His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.",
    "footnotes": "(V.3:103) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه in the Hadîth Books (At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Mâjah and Abu Dâwûd) that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"The Jews and Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two religious sects, and this nation will be divided into seventy-three religious sects - all in Hell, except one, and that one is the one on which I and my Companions are today [i.e. following the Qur’ân and the Prophet’s Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)].\""
