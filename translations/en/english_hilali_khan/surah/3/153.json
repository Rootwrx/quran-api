  "translation": " 153. (And remember) when you ran away (dreadfully) without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) was in your rear calling you back. There did Allâh give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, nor for that which had befallen you. And Allâh is Well-Aware of all that you do.",
