    "footnotes": " (V.3:149) What is said about residence (staying) in the land of Ash-Shirk (polytheism i.e. the land where polytheism is practised). Narrated Samurah bin Jundubرضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Anybody (from among the Muslims) who meets, gathers together, lives, and stays (permanently) with a Mushrik (polytheist or a disbeliever in the Oneness of Allâh, etc.) and agrees to his ways, opinion, etc. and (enjoys) his living with him (Mushrik) then he (that Muslim) is like him (Mushrik). (This Hadîth indicates that a Muslim should not stay in a non-Muslim country, he must emigrate to a Muslim country, where Islâm is practised.)\" [The Book of Jihâd, Abu Dâwûd]."
