  "footnotes": "[1] (V.3:134) Narrated Abu Hurairahرضي الله عنه : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, \"Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a human being\".* If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding animal by helping him to ride on it or by lifting his luggage on to it, all this will be regarded as charity. A good word, and every step one takes to offer the compulsory congregational prayer is regarded as charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.141).\n* To show gratitude to Allâh for keeping your body safe and sound, you should give in charity or do charitable deeds. \n[2]  (V.3:134) Narrated Abu Hurairahرضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger(صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, \"The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.135).\n[3] (V.3:134) Al-Muhsinûn: Doers of good, those who perform good deeds totally for Allâh’s sake only without any show-off or to gain praise or fame and they do them in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of Allâh’s Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)."
