Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.[1]",

Where are they taking it (me)?’ Its voice is heard by everything except man, and if he heard it, he would fall unconscious.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2,Hadith No.400)."
