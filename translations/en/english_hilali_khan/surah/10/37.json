    "translation": " 37. And this Qur’ân is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allâh (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation)[1] which was before it [i.e. the Taurât (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)], and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. laws, decreed for mankind) - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).",
    "footnotes": "(V.10:37) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"There was no Prophet among the Prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I have been given is the Divine Revelation which Allâh has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other Prophet on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.379)."
