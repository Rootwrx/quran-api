    "translation": " 19. Mankind were but one community (i.e. on one religion - Islâmic Monotheism), then they differed (later); and had not it been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, it would have been settled between them regarding what they differed[1].",
    "footnotes": "(V.10:19) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Every child is born on Al-Fitrah [true faith of Islâmic Monotheism (i.e. to worship none but Allâh Alone)], but his parents convert him to Judaism or Christianity or Magianism, as an animal gives birth to a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadith No.467). [See also the Qur’ân, Verse 30:30]"
