This has been narrated by ‘Ali رضي الله عنه on the authority of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.\nNarrated ‘Âsim: I said to Anas, \"Did Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم make Al-Madinah a sanctuary?\" He replied, \"Yes, Al-Madinah is a sanctuary from such and such place to such and such place. It is forbidden to cut its trees, and whoever innovates a heresy in it or commits a sin therein, will incur the Curse of Allâh, the angels, and all the people,\" Then Mûsâ bin Anas told me that Anas added, \"... or gives refuge to such a heretic or a sinner ...\"\n(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.409)."
