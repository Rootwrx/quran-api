  "translation": " 18. And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allâh. Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord!\" No doubt! the curse of Allâh is on the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers, oppressors).[2]",
  "footnotes": "(V.11:18) The Statement of Allâh عز وجل: \"The witnesses will say: ‘These are the ones who lied against their Lord...’\"\nNarrated Safwân bin Muhriz: While Ibn ‘Umar was performing the Tawâf (around the Ka‘bah), a man came up to him and said, \"O Abu ‘Abdur-Rahmân!\" or said, \"O Ibn ‘Umar! Did you hear anything from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم about An-Najwâ?\"* Ibn ‘Umar said, \"I heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘The believer will be brought near his Lord.’\" (Hishâm, a subnarrator said, reporting the Prophet’s words), \"The believer will come near (his Lord) till his Lord covers him with His Screen and makes him confess his sins. (Allâh will ask him). ‘Do you know (that you did) such-and-such a sin.’ He will say twice, ‘Yes, I know I did commit those sins.’ Then Allâh will say, ‘I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today.’ Then the record of his good deeds will be folded up [i.e. the record (Book) of his good deeds will be given to him]. As for the others or the disbelievers, it will be announced publicly before the witnesses: ‘These are the ones who lied against their Lord.’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.207).\n* An-Najwâ: the private talk between Allâh and His slave on the Day of Resurrection. It also means, a secret counsel or conference or consultation."
