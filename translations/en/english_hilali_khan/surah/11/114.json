  "translation": " 114. And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salât (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [2]",
  "footnotes": "(V.11:114):\n(A) Narrated Ibn Mas‘ûd رضي الله عنه: A man kissed a woman and then came to Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and told him of that. So this Divine Revelation was revealed to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم \"And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ) at the two ends of the day, and in some hours of the night; [i.e. the (five) compulsory Salât (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (small sins). That is a reminder for the mindful.\" (V.11:114). The man said, \"Is this instruction for me only?\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"It is for all those of my followers who encounter a similar situation.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No: 209).\n(B) Narrated Abu Dharr رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said to me: \"(a) Be afraid of Allâh and keep your duty to him wherever you may be. (b) And follow up the evil deeds with the good deeds, (verily) the good deeds remove (blot out) the evil deeds. (c) And (treat) behave with the people in a high standard of character.\" (This Hadith is quoted by At-Tirmidhi)."
