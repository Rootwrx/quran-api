  "translation": " 7. And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death,\" those who disbelieve would be sure to say, \"This is nothing but obvious magic.[1]\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.11:7) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"The Right (Hand) of Allâh is full, and (its fullness) is not affected by the continuous spending night and day. Do you see what He has spent since He created the heavens and the earth? Yet all that has not decreased what is in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His other Hand is the Bounty or the Power to bring about death, and He raises some people and brings others down.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.515)"
