  "footnotes": "(V.23:60) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها (the wife of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), I asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم about this (following Verse): \"And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear ...\" (V.23:60).\nShe added: \"Are these who drink alcoholic drinks and steal?\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: \"No! O the daughter of As-Siddîq, but they are those who fast, pray, and practise charity and they are afraid that (their good) deeds may not be accepted (by Allâh) from them. ‘It is these who hasten in good deeds.’ \" (Sunan At-Tirmidhi Hadith No.3225), (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubî)."
