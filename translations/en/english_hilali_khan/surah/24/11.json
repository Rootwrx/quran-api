  "translation": " 11. Verily those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها the wife of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) are a group among you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.",
