    "translation": " 41. Verily! Allâh grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.[2]",
    "footnotes": "(V.35:41) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, \"(On the Day of Resurrection) Allah will grasp the whole planet of earth (by His Hand), and roll all the heavens up with His Right Hand, and then He will say, ‘I am the King; where are the kings of the earth?’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.336)."
