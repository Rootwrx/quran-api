  "translation": " 68. And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allâh wills. Then it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be standing, looking on (waiting).[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.39:68).\na) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"I will be the first to raise my head after the second blowing of the Trumpet and will see Mûsâ (Moses) holding or clinging to the Throne; and I will not know whether he had been in that state all the time or after the blowing of the Trumpet.\" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.337).\nb) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Between the two blowings of the Trumpet there will be forty.\" The people said, \"O Abû Hurairah! Forty days?\" I refused to reply. They said, \"Forty years?\" I refused to reply. They said, \"Forty Months?\" I refused to reply and added: Everything of a human body will waste away, perish or decay except the last coccyx bone (of the tail) and from that bone Allâh will reconstruct the whole body. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.338)."
