    "translation": " 44. And if We had sent this as a Qur’ân in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: \"Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?\" Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur’ân) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand).\"",
