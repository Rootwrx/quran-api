  "translation": " 30. Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allâh (Alone),\" and then they stand firm,[1] on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!",
  "footnotes": "(V.41:30) In Arabic Istaqâmû: Stand firm i.e. they followed (really) the religion of Islamic Monotheism, believed in the Oneness of Allâh, and worshipped none but Him (Alone), and performed all that was ordained by Allâh (good deeds) and abstained from all that was forbidden by Allâh (sins and evil deeds)."
