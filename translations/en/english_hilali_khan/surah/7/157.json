  "translation": " 157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) whom they find written with them in the Taurât (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John xiv, 16)[1], - he commands them for Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allâh’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’ân) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful[2].",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.7:157) There exists in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), even after the original text has been distorted, clear prophecies indicating the coming of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , e.g. Deut. 18: 18,21:21; Psl. 118:22-23; Isa. 42: 1-13; Hab.3:3-4; Matt. 21:42-43; Jn.14: 12-17, 26-28, 16: 7-14.\n[2] (V.7:157):\nA) \"O you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammadصلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is (already) with you, before We efface faces [by making them (faces) like the backs of the necks; without nose, mouth and eyes], and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath -breakers. And the Commandment of Allâh is always executed.\" (V.4:47).\nB) See (V.57:28), and its footnote."
