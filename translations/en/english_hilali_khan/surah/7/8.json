They are: سبحان الله وبحمده - سبحان الله العظيم\nSubhân Allâhi-wa bihamdihi - Subhân Allâhil-‘Azîm’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol. 9. hadîth No.652).\n‘Glorified be Allâh and praised be He’ - ‘Glorified be Allâh, the Most Great.’ (or I deem Allâh above all those unsuitable things ascribed to Him, and free Him from resembling anything whatsoever, and I glorify His Praises! I deem Allâh, the Most Great above all those unsuitable things ascribed to Him and free Him from resembling anything whatsoever)."
