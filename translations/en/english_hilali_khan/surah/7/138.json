    "translation": "138. And We brought the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea, and they came upon a people devoted to some of their idols (in worship). They said: \"O Mûsâ (Moses)! Make for us an ilâh[1] (a god) as they have âlihah (gods).\" He said: \"Verily, you are a people who know not (the Majesty and Greatness of Allâh and what is obligatory upon you, i.e. to worship none but Allâh Alone, the One and the Only God of all that exists).\"",
    "footnotes": "(V.7:138) Ilâh: Who has all the right to be worshipped."
