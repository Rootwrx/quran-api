  "translation": " 26. O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, that they may remember (i.e. leave falsehood and follow truth[1]).",
  "footnotes": "(V.7:26) It is said that the pagan Arabs in the Pre-Islâmic Period of Ignorance used to do Tawâf (going round) of the Ka‘bah in a naked state. So when Islâm became victorious and Makkah was conquered, the pagans and the polytheists were forbidden to enter Makkah, and none was allowed to do Tawâf of the Ka‘bah in a naked state."
