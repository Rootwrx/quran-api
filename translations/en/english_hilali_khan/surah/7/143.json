  "translation": " 143. And when Mûsâ (Moses) came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord (Allah) spoke to him; he said: \"O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.\" Allâh said: \"You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.\" So when his Lord appeared to the mountain[2], He made it collapse to dust, and Mûsâ (Moses) fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.7:143) The appearance of Allâh جل جلاله to the mountain was very little of Him. It was approximately equal to the tip of one’s little finger as explained by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم when he recited this Verse. (This hadîth is quoted by Tirmidhi)."
