  "translation": " 71. (And remember) the Day when We shall call together call human beings with their (respective) Imâm [their Prophets, or their records of good and bad deeds, or their Holy Books like the Qur’ân, the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the leaders whom the people followed in this world.]. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.",
