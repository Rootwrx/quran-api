    "footnotes": "(V.17:67) Ibn Kathir in his Book of Tafsîr as regards this Verse (17:67) said: ‘Ikrimah bin Abî Jahl fled from Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم (at the time) when Makkah was conquered. He rode over the (Red) Sea to cross over to Ethiopia, but (as they proceeded), a heavy stormy wind overtook their boat, and huge waves came to them from all sides, and they thought that they are encircled therein. The people of the boat said to one another \"None can save you except Allâh (the Only True God of the heavens and earth). So invoke (call upon) Him (Allâh) (by making your Faith pure for Him Alone and none else) to deliver you safe (from drowning).\" ‘Ikrimah said to himself. ‘By Allâh if none can benefit in the sea except Allâh (Alone) then no doubt none can benefit over the land except Allâh (Alone). O Allâh! I promise You that if You delivered me safe from this, I will go and put my hands in the hands of (Prophet) Muhammad and surely I will find him full of pity, kindness and mercy.’ So they were delivered safe (by Allâh), and returned to their sea-shore and came out of the sea. ‘Ikrimah then proceeded to Allâh’s Messenger, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (narrated his story), embraced Islâm (just as he promised Allâh), and became a perfect Muslim.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)."
