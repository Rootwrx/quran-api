    "translation": " 159. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allâh and a human being][1] before his [‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام) or a Jew’s or a Christian’s] death[2] (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.",
    "footnotes": "[1] (V.4:159) See the footnote of (V.3:55).\n[2] (V.4:159) - \"Before his death,\" has two interpretations: before Jesus’ death after his descent from the heavens, or a Jew’s or a Christian’s death, at the time of the appearance of the Angel of Death when he will realize that ‘Îsâ (Jesus) was only a Messenger of Allâh, and had no share in Divinity."
