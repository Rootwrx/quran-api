  "translation": " 171. O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allâh aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allâh and His Word, (\"Be!\" - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rûh )[1] created by Him; so believe in Allâh and His Messengers. Say not: \"Three (trinity)!\" Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allâh is (the only) One Ilâh (God), glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allâh is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.[2]",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.4:171) Rûh-ullâh: According to the early religious scholars from among the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and their students and the Mujtahidûn , there is a rule to distinguish between the two nouns in the genitive construction:\na) When one of the two nouns is Allâh, and the other is a person or a thing, e.g. Allâh’s House (Bait-ullâh); Allâh’s Messenger (Rasul-ullâh): Allâh’s slave (‘Abdullâh): Allâh’s spirit (Rûh-ullâh), the rule for the above words is that the second noun, e.g., house, messenger, slave, spirit is created by Allâh and is honourable in His Sight, and similarly, Allâh’s spirit may be understood as the spirit of Allâh, in fact it is a soul created by Allâh, i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus). And it was His Word: \"Be!\" -and he was.[i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus) was created like Adam].\nb) But when one of the two is Allâh and the second is neither a person nor a thing, then it is not a created thing but is a quality of Allâh e.g. Allâh’s Knowledge (‘Ilm-ullâh); Allâh’s Life (Hayât-ullâh); Allâh’s Statement (Kalâm-ullâh); Allâh’s Self (Dhat-ullâh).\n[2] (V.4:171) Narrated ‘Ubadah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"If anyone testifies that lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh Alone) Who has no partners, and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is His slave and His Messenger, and that Jesus عليه السلام is Allâh’s slave and His Messenger and His Word (\"Be!\" - and he was) which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit (Rûh) created by Him, and that Paradise is the truth, and Hell is the truth - Allâh will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those deeds were few.\" (Junadah, the subnarrator said; \"Ubâdah added: ‘Such a person can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes.’ \") (Sahih Al Bukhârî, Vol. 4, Hadîth No. 644)."
