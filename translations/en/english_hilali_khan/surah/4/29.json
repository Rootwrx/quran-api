    "footnotes": " (V.4:29) What is said about committing suicide.\nNarrated Thâbit bin Ad-Dahhak رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever intentionally swears falsely by a religion other than Islâm, then he is what he had said, (e.g. if he says, ‘If such thing is not true then I am a Jew, ‘he is really a Jew if he is a liar). And whoever commits suicide with a piece of iron, will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell-fire.\"\nNarrated Jundub: The Prophetصلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so Allâh said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 2, Hadîth No.445).\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophetصلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell-fire, and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-fire.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.2, Hadîth No.446)."
