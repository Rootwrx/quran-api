  "translation": " 154. And for their covenant, We raised over them the Mount and (on the other occasion) We said: \"Enter the gate prostrating (or bowing) with humility;\" and We commanded them: \"Transgress not (by doing worldly works) on the Sabbath (Saturday).\" And We took from them a firm covenant[1].",
  "footnotes": "(V.4:154) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"It was said to Banî Israel, ‘Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility (prostrating yourselves) and say: ‘Repentance’, but they changed the word and entered the town crawling on their buttocks and said: ‘A wheat grain in the hair’*.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 615).\n*They said so just to ridicule Allâh’s Order as they were disobedient to Him. So Allâh punished them severely by sending on them punishment, most probably in the form of (an epidemic of) plague (See Tafsir At-Tabari )."
