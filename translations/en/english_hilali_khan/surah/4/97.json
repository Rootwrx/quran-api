  "translation": " 97. Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): \"In what (condition) were you?\" They reply: \"We were weak and oppressed on the earth.\" They (angels) say: \"Was not the earth of Allâh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?\" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination![1]",
