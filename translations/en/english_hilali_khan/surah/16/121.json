    "translation": " 121. (He was) thankful for His (Allâh’s) Favours. He (Allâh) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a Straight Path (Islâmic Monotheism - neither Judaism nor Christianity[1]).",
    "footnotes": "(V.16:121) (A) Ibrâhîim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism - to worship none but Allâh Alone) and he joined none in worship with Allâh. [The Qur’an, Verse 3: 67]\n(B) See the footnote (B) of (V.16:71).\n(C) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام did not tell a lie except on three occasions. Twice for the sake of Allâh عز وجل when he said, \"I am sick,\" and he said, \"(I have not done this but) the big idol has done it.\"* The (third was) that while Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and Sârah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant from among the tyrants. Someone said to the tyrant, \"This man (i.e. Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام) is accompanied by a very charming lady.\" So, he sent for Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and asked him about Sârah saying, \"Who is this lady?\" Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, \"She is my sister.\" Ibrâhîm (Abraham) went to Sârah and said, ‘O Sârah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don’t contradict my statement.\" The tyrant then called Sârah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sârah, \"Pray to Allâh for me, and I shall not harm you.\" So Sârah asked Allâh to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again requested Sârah, \"Pray to Allâh for me, and I will not harm you,\" Sârah asked Allâh again and he became right. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, \"You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil.\" The tyrant then gave Hâjar as a girl-servant to Sârah. Sârah came back [to Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] while he was praying. Ibrâhîm (Abraham), gesturing with his hand, asked, \"What has happened?\" She replied \"Allâh has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hâjar for service\". (Abu Hurairah then addressed his listeners saying, \"That (Hâjar) was your mother, O Banî Mâ’-is-Samâ’ (i.e. the Arabs).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.578)\n* The idolaters invited Ibrâhîm (Abraham) to join them in their celebrations outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was left alone, he came to their idols and broke them into pieces. When the idolaters questioned him, he claimed that he had not destroyed their idols but the chief idol had, which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) left undisturbed and on whose shoulder he had put an axe to lay the accusation on it."
