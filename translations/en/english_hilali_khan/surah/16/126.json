    "translation": " 126. And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allâh), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-Sâbirûn (the patient).[3]",
    "footnotes": "(V.16:126)\na) The Statement of Allâh: \"Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning\" (V.39:10)\nNarrated Abu Mûsâ رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"None is more patient than Allâh against the harmful saying He hears from the people, they ascribe a son (or offspring) to Him, yet He gives them health and (supplies them with) provision.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.121)\nb) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم divided and distributed something as he used to do with some of his distributions. A man from the Ansâr said, \"By Allâh! in this division the pleasure of Allâh has not been intended.\" I said, \"I will definitely tell this to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. \" So I went to him while he was sitting with his companions and told him of it secretly. That was hard upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the colour of his face changed, and he became so angry that I wished I had not told him. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then said, \"Mûsâ (Moses) was harmed with more than this, yet he remained patient.\" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.122)"
