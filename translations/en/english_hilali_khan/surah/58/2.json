  "translation": " 2. Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by (Zihâr الظهار)[1] (i.e. by saying to them \"You are like my mother’s back,\") they cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie. And verily, Allâh is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.",
  "footnotes": "(V.58:2) Az-Zihâr الظهار is the saying of a husband to his wife: You are to me like the back of my mother (i.e. unlawful for me to approach)."
