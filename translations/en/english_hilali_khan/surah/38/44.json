  "translation": " 44. \"And take in your hand a bundle of thin grass and strike therewith (your wife), and break not your oath.[1] Truly! We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!",
  "footnotes": "(V.38:44) During the ailment of Ayyûb (Job), his wife used to beg for him, and Satan told her a word of disbelief to say and she told her husband [Ayyûb (Job)]; so he became angry with her and took an oath to strike her one hundred lashes. So Allah ordered Ayyûb (Job) to fulfil his oath by striking her with the bundle of thin grass. (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubi,)."
