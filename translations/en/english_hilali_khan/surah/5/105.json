    "translation": " 105. O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves[1]. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error. The return of you all is to Allâh, then He will inform you about (all) that which you used to do.",
    "footnotes": "(V.5:105) Take care of yourselves i.e. do righteous deeds, fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)."
