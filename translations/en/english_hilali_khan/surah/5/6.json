    "translation": "6. O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salât (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to ankles[1]. If you are in a state of Janâba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands.[2] Allâh does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful.",
    "footnotes": "[1] (V.5:6) The superiority of ablution. And Al-Ghurr-ul Muhajjalûn (the parts of the body of the Muslims washed in ablution will shine on the Day of Resurrection and the angels will call them by that name) from the traces of ablution.\nNarrated Nu‘aim Al-Mujmir: Once I went up the roof of the mosque along with Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه. He performed ablution and said, \"I heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘On the Day of Resurrection, my followers will be called Al-Ghurr-ul-Muhajjalûn from the traces of ablution and whoever can increase the area of his radiance* should do so (by performing ablution in the most perfect manner).’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.138).\n*The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم did not increase the area more than what is washed of the body parts while doing ablution as Allâh ordered to be washed in the Qur’ân. [For details about Wudu (ablution), see Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, (The Book of Ablution)].\n[2] (V.5:6) Strike your hands on the earth and then pass the palm of each on the back of the other and then blow off the dust from them and then pass (rub) them on your face: this is called Tayammum"
