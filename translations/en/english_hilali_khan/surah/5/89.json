    "translation": " 89. Allâh will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation feed ten Masâkîn (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn[1]. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)[2]. Thus Allâh make clear to you His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful.",
    "footnotes": "[1] (V.5:89) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"We (Muslims) are the last (to come) in the world, but (will be) foremost on the Day of Resurrection.\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم also said, \"By Allâh, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allâh’s consideration than that of dissolving his oath and making its expiation with that which Allâh has commanded. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.621).\n[2] (V.5:89) It is better not to take oaths, but if you have taken it, and later you find a better solution for the problem, then act according to the better one and give expiation for the oath."
