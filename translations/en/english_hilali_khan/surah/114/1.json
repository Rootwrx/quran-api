  "footnotes": "(V.114:1) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها: whenever Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم went to bed, he used to recite Sûrat Al-Ikhlâs (112), Sûrat Al-Falaq (113) and Sûrat An-Nâs (114) and then blow on his palms and pass them over his face and those parts of his body that his hands could reach. And when he fell ill, he used to order me to do like that for him. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadith No.644)."
