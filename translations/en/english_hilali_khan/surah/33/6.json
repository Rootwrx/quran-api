    "translation": " 6. The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves,[3] and his wives are their (believers’) mothers (as regards respect and marriage). And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allâh (regarding inheritance) than (the brotherhood of) the believers and the Muhâjirûn (emigrants from Makkah), except that you do kindness to those brothers (when the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم joined them in brotherhood ties). This has been written in the (Allâh’s Book of Divine) Decrees - (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).\"",
    "footnotes": "(V.33:6) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin Hishâm رضي الله عنه: We were with the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and he was holding the hand of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb. ‘Umar said to Him. \"O Allâh’s Messenger! You are dearer to me than everything except my ownself.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, (you will not have complete Faith) till I am dearer to you than your ownself.\" Then ‘Umar said to him, now, by Allâh, you are dearer to me than my ownself.\" The Prophet said, \" Now, O ‘Umar, (now you are a believer).\" Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No.682)."
