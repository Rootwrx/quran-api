  "footnotes": "(V.33:35)\na) \"Remember Allâh\" (while sitting, standing, lying for more than 300 times extra over the remembrance of Allâh during the five compulsory congregational prayer) or praying extra additional nawâfil prayers of night in the last part of night.)\nb) See the footnote of (V.13:28).\nc) Narrated Abû Huraira رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh has some angels who look for those who remember (glorify the Praises of) Allâh on the roads and paths. And when they find some people remembering (glorifying the Praises of) Allâh, they call each others, saying, ‘Come to the object of your pursuit’.\" He added, \"Then the angels encircle them with their wings up to the nearest Heaven to us.\" He added, \"[After those people remembered (glorified the Praises of) Allâh, and the angels go back to Allâh, their Lord عز وجلasks them (those angels) - though He knows better than them - ‘What do My slaves say?’ The angels reply, ‘They say: Subhân Allâh, Allâh Akbar, and Alham-du-lillâh’ Allâh then says, ‘Did they see Me?’ The angels reply, ‘No! By Allâh, they didn’t see You.’ Allâh says, ‘How it would have been if they saw Me?’ The angels reply, ‘If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and remember You (glorify Your Praises) more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to any thing more often,’ Allâh says (to the angels), ‘What do they ask Me for?’ The angels reply, ‘They ask You for Paradise.’ Allâh says (to the angels), ‘Did they see it?’ The angels say, ‘No! By Allâh, O Lord They didn’t see it.’ Allâh says: ‘How it would have been if they saw it?’ The angels say, ‘If they saw it, they would have greater covetousness for it and would seek it for greater zeal and would have greater desire for it.’ Allâh says, ‘From what do they seek refuge?’ The angels reply, ‘They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.’ Allâh says, ‘Did they see it?’ The angels say, ‘No! By Allâh, O Lord! They didn’t see it.’ Allâh says, ‘How it would have been if they saw it?’ The angels say, ‘If they saw it, they would flee from it with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.’ Then Allâh says, ‘I make you witness that I have forgiven them’.\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"One of the angels would say, ‘There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he had just come for some need.’ Allâh would say, ‘These are those people whose companions will not be reduced to misery’.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No.417)."
