  "translation": " 33. And when Our Messengers came to Lût (Lot), he was grieved because of them, and felt straitened on their account. They said: \"Have no fear, and do not grieve! Truly, we shall save you and your family, except your wife: she will be of those who remain behind (i.e. she will be destroyed along with those who will be destroyed from her folk).",
