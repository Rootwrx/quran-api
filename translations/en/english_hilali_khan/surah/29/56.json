He repeated this call three times and then said, \"Do you know what Allâh’s Right on His slaves is?\" I replied \"No.\" He said, \"Allâh’s Right on His slaves is that they should worship Him (Alone) and should not join partners in worship with Him.\" He proceeded for a while and then said, \"O Mu‘âdh!\" I replied, \"Labbaik wa Sa‘daik (I respond to your call and I am obedient to your orders).\" He said, \"Do you know what the right of (Allâh’s) slaves on Allah is, if they do that (worship Him Alone and join none in His worship)? It is that He will not punish them.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No. 283)."
