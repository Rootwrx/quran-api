  "translation": " 26. And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts; but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayât (Allâh’s Prophets and their Prophethood, proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations) of Allâh, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!",
