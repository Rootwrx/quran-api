    "translation": " 35. Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will[2] and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! this Qur’ân is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are Al-Fâsiqûn (the rebellious against Allâh’s Command, the disobedient to Allâh)?",
    "footnotes": "(V.46:35) There are many Prophets and Messengers of Allah, about twenty-five of them are mentioned in the Qur’an; out of these twenty-five, only five are of strong will: namely, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, Nûh (Noah), Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses) and ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليها السلام ."
