    "translation": " 35. This, because you took the revelations of Allâh (this Qur’ân) in mockery, and the life of the world deceived you. So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there (Hell),[1] nor shall they be returned to the worldly life, (so that they repent to Allâh, and beg His Pardon for their sins).",

Qat ! (enough! enough!) By Your ‘Izzat (Honour and Power) and Your Karam (Generosity)!’ Paradise will remain spacious enough to accommodate more people until Allâh will create some more people and let them dwell in the superfluous (empty) space of Paradise.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.481).\nc) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, \"I seek refuge (with You) By Your ‘Izzat (Honour and Power) Lâ ilâha illâ Anta (none has the right to be worshipped but You); Who does not die, while the jinn and the human beings die.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.480)."
