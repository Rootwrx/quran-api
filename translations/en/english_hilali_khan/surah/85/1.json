  "footnotes": "(V.85:1) (About the) Stars, Abu Qatâdah mentioning Allâh’s Statement:\n\"And We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps,\" and said, \"The creation of these stars is for three purposes, i.e., as decoration of the heaven, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travellers. So, if anybody tries to find a different interpretation, he is mistaken and just wastes his efforts, and troubles himself with what is beyond his limited knowledge.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Chapter 3)."
