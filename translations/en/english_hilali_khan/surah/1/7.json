    "translation": " 7. The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace[4] , not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger [5] (i.e. those who knew the Truth, but did not follow it) nor of those who went astray (i.e. those who did not follow the Truth out of ignorance and error). [6], [7]",
    "footnotes": "[4] (V.1:7) i.e. the way of the Prophets, the Siddîqûn (i.e. those followers of the Prophet, who were first and foremost to believe in him, like Abu Bakr As-Siddîq), the martyrs and the righteous, [as Allâh عز وجل said: \"And whoso obeys Allâh and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allâh has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddîqûn, the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!\" (V.4:69)].\n[5] (V.1:7) Narrated ‘Adi bin Hâtim رضي الله عنه: I asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , about the Statement of Allâh: 1. \" غير المغضوب عليهم Ghairil-maghdûbi ‘alaihim (not the way of those who earned Your Anger),\" he صلى الله عليه وسلم replied \"They are the Jews\". And 2. ولا الضالين Walad dâllîn (nor of those who went astray),\" he صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: \"The Christians, and they are the ones who went astray\" [This Hadith is quoted by At-Tirmidhi and Musnad Abu Dâwûd ].\n[6] (V.1:7): Narrated ‘Ubâdah bin As-Sâmit رضي الله عنه Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever does not recite Sûrat Al-Fâtihah in his prayer, his prayer is invalid. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No. 723). \n[7] (V.1:7): Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâ h’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"When the Imâm says: Ghairi l-maghdûbi ‘alaihim Walad-dâllîn [i.e. not the way of those who earned Your Anger, nor the way of those who went astray (1:7)], then you must say, Amîn , for if one’s utterance of Amîn coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No. 2)."
