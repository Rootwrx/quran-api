So if you can avoid missing (through sleep or business) a prayer before the sunrise (Fajr) and a prayer before sunset (‘Asr ), you must do so’. ‘He then recited Allah’s Statement:\n\"And glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before (its) setting.\" (V.50:39).\nIsmâ‘îl said: \"Offer those prayers and do not miss them.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadîth No.529)\nb) See the footnote of (V.32:16)."
