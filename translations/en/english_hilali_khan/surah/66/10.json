  "translation": " 10. Allâh sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Nûh (Noah) and the wife of Lût (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed them (their husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they [Nûh (Noah) and Lût (Lot) عليهما السلام] availed them (their respective wives) not against Allâh and it was said: \"Enter the Fire along with those who enter!\"",
