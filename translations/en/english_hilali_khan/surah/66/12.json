  "translation": " 12. And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imrân who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Rûh [i.e. Jibrîl (Gabriel)[3]], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of Allâh: \"Be!\" - and he was; that is ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of Allâh], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qânitûn (i.e. obedient to Allâh)[4].",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.66:12) \"And (remember) she who guarded her chastity [Virgin Maryam (Mary)], We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) [through Our Rûh (Jibrîl - Gabriel)]*, and We made her and her son (Jesus) a sign for Al-‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn).\" [The Qur’ân, (V.21:91)]\n* It is said that Jibrîl (Gabriel) had merely breathed in the sleeve of Maryam’s (Mary) shirt, and thus she conceived.\n[2] (V.66:12) The Statement of Allâh عز وجل:\n‘And Allâh has set forth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh ... (up to) ... and she was of the obedient to Allâh.’ (V.66:11 and 12).\nNarrated Abû Mûsâ رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Many amongst men reached (the level of) perfection but none amongst the women reached this level except Âsiyah, Pharaoh’s wife, and Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imrân. And no doubt, the superiority of ‘Âishah to other women is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e. a meat and bread dish) to other meals.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadith No.623)."
