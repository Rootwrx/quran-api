    "translation": " 59. But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijz (a punishment)[1] from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh’s obedience. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",
    "footnotes": " (V.2:59) Narrated Usâmah bin Zaid رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Plague was a means of torture sent on a group of Israelis (or on some people before you). So if you hear of its spread in a land, don’t approach it, and if plague should appear in a land where you are present, then don’t leave that land in order to run away from it (i.e. plague).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri Vol.4, Hadîth No.679)."
