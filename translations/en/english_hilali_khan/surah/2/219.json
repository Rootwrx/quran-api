    "translation": " 219. They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling.[4] Say: \"In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they ought to spend. Say: \"That which is beyond your needs.\" Thus Allâh makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought.\" [5]",
    "footnotes": "(V.2:219):\n[1] a) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever takes an oath in which he (forgetfully), mentions Lat and ‘Uzza (i.e. two idols of Arab pagans) should say: \"La ilaha illallâh\" (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and whoever says to his companion, ‘Come along, let us gamble,’ must give alms (as an expiation).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No.383).\nb) Narrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever drinks alcoholic drinks in this world and does not repent (i.e. stops drinking alcoholic drinks, and begs Allâh to forgive him before his death) will be deprived of it in the Hereafter.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No 481).\nc) Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: I heard from Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم a narration which none other than I will narrate to you. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"From among the portents of the Hour are the following: General ignorance (in religious affairs) will prevail, (religious) knowledge will decrease, illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, alcoholic drinks will be drunk (in abundance), men will decrease and women will increase so much so that for every fifty women there will be one man to look after them.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No. 483)\nd) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"An adulterer-fornicator, at the time he is committing illegal sexual intercourse is not a believer; and a person, at the time of drinking an alcoholic drink is not a believer; and a thief, at the time of stealing, is not a believer.\"\nIbn Shihâb said: ‘Abdul-Mâlik bin Abî-Bakr bin ‘Abdur-Rahmân bin Al-Hârith bin Hishâm told me that Abu Bakr used to narrate that narration to him on the authority of Abu Hurairah. He used to add that Abu Bakr used to mention, besides the above cases: \"And he who robs (takes illegally something by force) while the people are looking at him, is not a believer at the time he is robbing (taking it).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No. 484). \n[2] (V.2:219) The provision of this Verse concerning alcoholic drinks and gambling has been abrogated by the Verse 5:90."
