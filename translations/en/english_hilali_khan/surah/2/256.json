  "translation": " 256. There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Tâghût [2] and believes in Allâh, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:256) الطاغوت هو كل ما عبد من دون الله إلا من لم يرض بعبادته فلا يعتبر طاغوتا The word Tâghût covers a wide range of meanings: It means anything worshipped other than the Real God (Allâh), but the one who does not accept to be worshipped will not be considered as a Tâghût, i.e. all the false deities. It may be Satan, devils, idols, stones, sun, stars, angels, human beings, who were falsely worshipped and taken as Tâghûts Likewise saints, graves, rulers, leaders, etc., are falsely worshipped and wrongly followed. Sometimes \"Tâghût\" means a false judge who gives a false judgement (see V.4:60). [See Tafsir Ibn Kathir and (V.4:51)]."
