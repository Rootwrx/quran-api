  "footnotes": "(V.2:152)\na) See the footnote of (V.13:28).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh عز وجل says, I am just as My slave thinks I am, (i.e. I am Able to do for him what he thinks I can do for him) and I am with him if he remembers Me. If he remembers Me in himself, I too, remember him in Myself; and if he remembers Me in a group of people, I remember him in a group that is better than them; and if he comes one span nearer to Me, I go one cubit nearer to him; and if he comes one cubit nearer to Me, I go a distance of two outstretched arms nearer to him; and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.502)."
