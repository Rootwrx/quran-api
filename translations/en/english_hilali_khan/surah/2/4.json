To testify that \" Lâ ilâha illallâh wa anna Muhammad-ur-Rasûl Allâh \" (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the Messenger of Allâh). \n2. Iqâmat-as-Salât: to perform the five (compulsory congregational) Salât (prayers). \n3. To pay Zakât \n4. To perform Hajj (i.e. pilgrimage to Makkah). \n5. To observe Saum (fasting) during the month of Ramadan. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 7)."
