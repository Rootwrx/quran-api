  "footnotes": "(V.2:226) Narrated Nâfi‘: Ibn ‘Umar used to say about Al-’Îla’ (الإيلاء)* which Allâh defined (in the Holy Book), \"If the period of Al-’Îla’ (الإيلاء) expires, then the husband has either to retain his wife in a handsome manner or to divorce her as Allâh [عز وجل] has ordered.\" Ibn ‘Umar added, \"When the period of four months has expired, the husband should divorce his wife, but the divorce does not occur unless the husband himself declares it. This has been mentioned by ‘Uthmân, ‘Alî, Abu Ad-Dardâ’, ‘Âishah and twelve other Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No. 213).\n* Al-’Îla’ (الإيلاء): means the oath taken by a husband that he would not approach his wife for a certain period."
