  "translation": "197. The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islâmic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj[1] therein (by assuming Ihrâm), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) Allâh knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:197) What is said regarding Hajj At-Tamattu‘, Hajj Al-Qirân, and Haij Al-Ifrâd. And whoever has not brought a Hady with him, he should finish the Ihrâm of Hajj, and make it as ‘Umrah, (and then assume another Ihrâm for Hajj from Makkah, etc.) There are three ways of performing Hajj - as follows:\na) Hajj At-Tamattu‘: It means that you have no Hady with you and you assume Ihrâm only for ‘Umrah first and after ‘Umrah you finish your Ihrâm and assume another Ihrâm for performing Hajj, from Makkah, but you have to slaughter a Hady.\nb) Hajj Al-Qirân: It means that one should have a Hady with him and should perform ‘Umrah and then Hajj with the same state of Ihrâm .\nc) Hajj AI-Ifrâd: It means that one assumes Ihrâm with the intention of performing Hajj only and does not perform ‘Umrah."
