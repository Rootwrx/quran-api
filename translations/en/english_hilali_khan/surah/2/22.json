  "translation": " 22. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allâh (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).[1]",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.2:22) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: I asked the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , \"What is the greatest sin in consideration with Allâh?\" He said, \"That you set up a rival unto Allâh though He Alone created you.\" I said, \"That is indeed a great sin.\" Then I asked, \"What is next?\" He said \"To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.\" I asked, \"What is next?\" He said, \"To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbour.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No. 4)."
