  "translation": " 44. Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves,[3] while you recite the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:44) Narrated Abu Wâ’il رضي الله عنه: Someone said to Usâma, Will you not talk to this (‘Uthmân)?\" Usâma said, \"I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go round and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him ‘O so and so! Didn‘t you use to order others for Al-Ma‘rûf (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good) and forbid them from Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and that is evil)?’ That man will say, ‘I used to order others to do Al-Ma‘rûf (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good) but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that is evil) but I myself used to do Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that is evil)’\". (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 9, Hadîth No. 218)."
