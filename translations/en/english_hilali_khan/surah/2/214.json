  "translation": " 214. Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, \"When (will come) the Help of Allâh?\" Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allâh is near!",
