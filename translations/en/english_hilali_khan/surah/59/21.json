    "footnotes": "(V.59:21) Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansâri woman or man said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we make a pulpit for you?\" He replied, \"If you wish.\" So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit [for delivering the Khutbah (religious talk)]. The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم descended (from the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near it.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 784)."
