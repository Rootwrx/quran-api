    "translation": "6. And (remember) when ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: \"O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allâh unto you, confirming the Taurât [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.[1] But when he (Ahmad i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) came to them with clear proofs, they said: \"This is plain magic.\"[2]",
    "footnotes": "[1] (V.61:6) i.e. the second name of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and it (Ahmad) literally means: \"One who praises Allâh more than others\". \n[2] (V.61:6) A) Narrated Jubair bin Mut‘im رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"I have five names: I am Muhammad and Ahmad; I am Al-Mahî through whom Allâh will eliminate Al-Kufr (infidelity); I am Al-Hashir who will be the first to be resurrected, the people being resurrected thereafter; and I am also Al-‘Âqib (i.e. there will be no Prophet after me).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadîfh No.732).\nB) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"By Him (Allâh) in Whose Hand my soul is, surely, the son of Mary [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] عليهما السلام * will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims), and will judge mankind justly by the Law of the Qur’ân (as a just ruler), and will break the Cross and kill the pigs and abolish the Jizyah [a tax taken from the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians), who are under the protection of a Muslim government. This Jizyah tax will not be accepted by ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام and all mankind will be required to embrace Islam with no other alternative]. Then there will be abundance of money and nobody will accept charitable gifts.\" (See Fath Al-Bari , Page No. 304 and 305, Vol. 7), (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Hadîth No.425).\n* ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary) عليهما السلام will descend as a leader of the Muslims and it is a severe warning to the Christians who claim to be the followers of ‘Îsâ (Jesus) and he will break the Cross and kill the pigs, and he will abolish the Jizyah (tax); and all mankind will be required to embrace Islam with no other alternative."
