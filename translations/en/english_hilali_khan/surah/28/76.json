  "translation": " 76. Verily, Qârûn (Korah) was of Mûsâ’s (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: \"Do not exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). Verily Allâh likes not those who exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh).",
