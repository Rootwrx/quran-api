And if any man of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) believes in his own Prophet and then believes in me (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) too, he will (also) get a double reward. And any slave who fulfils his duty to his master and to his Lord (Allah), will (also) get a double reward.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadîth No.20).\nb) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
