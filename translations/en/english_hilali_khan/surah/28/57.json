    "translation": " 57. And they say: \"If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.\" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not.[4]",
    "footnotes": "(V.28:57)\na) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: On the day of the conquest of Makkah, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Allâh has made this town a sanctuary. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, its game should not be chased, and its fallen things should not be picked up except by one who would announce them publicly.\" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadîth No.657).\nb) See the footnote of (V.2:191)."
