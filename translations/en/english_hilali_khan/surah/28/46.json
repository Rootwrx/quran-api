  "translation": " 46. And you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) were not at the side of the Tûr (Mount) when We did call: [it is said that Allâh called the followers of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, and they answered His Call, or that Allâh called Mûsâ (Moses)]. But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you: in order that they may remember or receive admonition. [Tafsir At-Tabarî].",
