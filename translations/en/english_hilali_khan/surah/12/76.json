  "translation": " 76. So he [Yûsuf (Joseph)] began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. Thus did We plan for Yûsuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), except that Allâh willed it. (So Allâh made the brothers to bind themselves with their way of \"punishment, i.e. enslaving of a thief.\") We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allâh).",
