    "translation": " 77. They [(Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brothers] said: \"If he steals, there was a brother of his [Yûsuf (Joseph)] who did steal before (him).\" But these things did Yûsuf (Joseph) keep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He said (within himself): \"You are in worst case, and Allâh is the Best Knower of that which you describe!\"",
