  "footnotes": "(V.21:100) Ibn Mas‘ûd رضي الله عنه recited this Verse and then said: \"When those (who are destined to remain in the Hell-fire forever) will be thrown in the Hell-fire, each of them will be put in a separate Tabût (box) of Fire, so that he will not see anyone punished in the Hell fire except himself.\" Then Ibn Mas‘ûd recited this Verse (21:100). [Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tabari and Qurtubî]."
