    "translation": " 14. And they belied them (those Ayât) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their ownselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayât ) are from Allâh, and Mûsâ (Moses) is the Messenger of Allâh in truth, but they disliked to obey Mûsâ (Moses), and hated to believe in his Message of Monotheism]. So see what was the end of the Mufsidûn (disbelievers, disobedient to Allâh, evil-doers and liars.).",
