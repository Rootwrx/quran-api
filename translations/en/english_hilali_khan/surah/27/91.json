  "translation": " 91. I (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this city (Makkah), Who has sanctified it and to Whom belongs everything. And I am commanded to be from among the Muslims (those who submit to Allâh in Islâm).[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.27:91)\na) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما : On the day of the conquest of Makkah, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Allâh has made this town a sanctuary. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, its game should not be chased, and its fallen things should not be picked up except by one who would announce them publicly.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadîth No.657).\nb) See the footnote of (V.2:191)."
