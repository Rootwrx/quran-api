  "translation": " 40. One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: \"I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!\" Then when he [Sulaimân (Solomon)] saw it placed before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his ownself; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself). Certainly my Lord is Rich (Free of all needs), Bountiful.\"",
