  "translation": " 36. In houses (mosques) which Allâh has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhan, Iqamah, Salât (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’ân etc.]. Therein glorify Him (Allah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.24:36).\na) Narrated Abu Qatâdah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"If anyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two Rak‘at (Tahiyyat-al-Masjid) before sitting.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.435).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"The reward of the Salât (prayer) offered by a person in congregation is multiplied twenty- five times as much than that of the Salât (prayer) offered in one’s house or in the market (alone). And this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque, with the sole intention of praying: then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his Salât (prayer), the angels keep on asking Allâh’s Blessings and Allâh’s Forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musallâ (place of prayer). They say: ‘O Allâh! Bestow Your Blessings upon him, be merciful and kind to him.’ And one is regarded in Salât (prayer) as long as one is waiting for the Salât (prayer).\" (Sahih Al Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadith No.620)."
