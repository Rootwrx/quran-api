  "translation": " 43. (The son) replied: \"I will betake myself to some mountain; it will save me from the water.\" Nûh (Noah) said: \"This day there is no saviour[1] from the Decree of Allâh except him on whom He has mercy.\" And waves came in between them, so he (the son) was among the drowned.",
  "footnotes": "(V.11:43) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"No Caliph is appointed but has two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it: and Al-Ma‘sûm (the sinless or the saved or the protected) is the one whom Allâh protects.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.608)."
