  "translation": " 17. And on the Day when He will gather them together and that which they worship besides Allâh [idols, angels, pious men, saints][1]. He will say: \"Was it you who misled these My slaves or did they (themselves) stray from the (Right) Path?\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.25:17) Narrated Mu‘âdh bin Jabal رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"O Mu‘âdh! Do you know what Allâh’s Right upon His slaves is?\" I said, \"Allâh and His Messenger know better.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"To worship Him (Allâh) Alone and to join none in worship with Him (Allâh). Do you know what their right upon Him is?\" I replied, \"Allâh and His Messenger know better.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Not to punish them (if they did so).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Hadith No. 470)."
