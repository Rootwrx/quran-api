  "footnotes": "(V.82:10) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Angels come (to you) in succession by night and day, and all of them get together at the time of the Fajr and ‘Asr prayers. Then those who have stayed with you overnight, ascend unto Allâh, Who asks them (and He knows the answer better than they): \"How have you left My slaves?\" They reply, \"We left them while they were praying and we came to them while they were praying\". The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added: \"If anyone of you says Amîn (during the prayer at the end of the recitation of Sûrat Al-Fâtihah), and the angels in heaven say the same, and the two sayings coincide, all his past sins will be forgiven\". (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.446)."
