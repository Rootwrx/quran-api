  "footnotes": "(V.82:11) Whoever intended to do a good deed or a bad deed.\nNarrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم narrating about his Lord عز وجل said, \"Allâh ordered (the angels appointed over you) that the good and the bad deeds be written, and He then showed (the way) how (to write). If somebody intends to do a good deed and he does not do it, then Allâh will write for him a full good deed (in his account with Him); and if he intends to do a good deed and actually does it, then Allâh will write for him (in his account) with Him (its reward equal) from ten to seven hundred times, to many more times; and if somebody intends to do a bad deed and he does not do it, then Allâh will write a full good deed (in his account) with Him, and if he intends to do it (a bad deed) and actually does it, then Allâh will write one bad deed (in his account).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.498)."
