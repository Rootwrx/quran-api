  "footnotes": "(V.12:92) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, \"Verily Allâh created mercy. The day He created it, He made it into one hundred parts. He withheld with Him ninety-nine parts, and sent its one part to all His creatures. Had a disbeliever known of all the mercy which is in the Hands of Allâh, he would not have lost hope of entering Paradise, and had a believer known of all the punishment which is present with Allâh, he would not have considered himself safe from the Hell-fire.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.476)."
