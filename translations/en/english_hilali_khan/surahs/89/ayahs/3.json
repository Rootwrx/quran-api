Some say: Even is the Day of Slaughtering of the Sacrifices, i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah, and Odd is the Day of ‘Arafah (Hajj ), i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijjah. Others say: Even is all the creatures and Odd is Allâh. Some say it is the compulsory congregational prayer, i.e. Maghrib is Witr , and the other four prayers are Shaf‘"
