  "translation": " 27. Allâh will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allâh Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter.[1] And Allâh will cause to go astray those who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers), and Allâh does what He wills.[2]",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.14:27) i.e. immediately after their death (in their graves, etc.), when the angels (Munkar and Nakîr ) will ask them three questions: As to: (1) Who is your Lord? (2) What is your religion? and (3) What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) who was sent to you? The believers will give the correct answers, i.e. (1) My Lord is Allâh; (2) My religion is Islâm; and (3) This man Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger, and he came to us with clear signs and we believed in him, - while the wrong-doers who believed not in the Message of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم will not be able to answer these questions. [See Tafsir Ibn Kathir].\n[2] (V.14:27) See the footnotes of (V.3:85) and (V.6:93)."
