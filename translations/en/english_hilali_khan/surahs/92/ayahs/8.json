  "footnotes": "(V.92:8) Narrated ‘Alî رضي الله عنه : We were in the company of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and he said, \"There is none among you but has his place written for him, either in Paradise or in the Hell-fire.\" We said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we depend (on this fact and give up work)?\" He replied, \"No! Carry on doing good deeds, for everybody will find easy (to do) such deeds as will lead him to his destined place.\" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم recited: \"As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allâh and fears Him, and believes in Al-Husnâ. We will make smooth for him the path of ease...\" (V.92: 5-10) (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.472)."
