  "translation": " 158. Do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord (Allâh) should come, or that some of the Signs of your Lord should come (i.e. portents of the Hour e.g., rising of the sun from the west)! The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith. Say: \"Wait you! we (too) are waiting.\"[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.6:158):\nA) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"The Hour will not be established until the sun rises from the west; and when the people see it, then whoever will be living on the surface of the earth, will have faith, and that is (the time) when no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before.\" (6:158) (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.6, Hadîth No.159).\nB) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said; \"When the following three signs appear, no good will it do to a person to believe then if he believed not before:\n1) Rising of the sun from the west.\n2) (The coming of Al-Masîh) Ad-Dajjal.\n3) (The coming out of the) Dâbbat-ul-Ard (i.e. a beast from the earth).\" (Sahih Muslim - The Book of Fitan - The Signs of the coming of the Hour).\nC). Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"No Prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Al-Masîh-Ad-Dajjâl). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord is not so, and there will be written between his (Al-Masîh Ad-Dajiâl’s) eyes (the word) Kâfir (i.e., disbeliever).\" [This Hadîth is also quoted by Abu Hurairah and Ibn ‘Abbâs. (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.9, Hadîth No.245)]."
