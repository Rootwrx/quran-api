  "footnotes": "(V.6:74) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"On the Day of Resurrection Ibrâhîm (Abraham) will meet his father Âzar whose face will be dark and covered with dust. (The Prophet) Ibrâhîm (Abraham) will say (to him): ‘Didn’t I tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will reply: ‘Today I will not disobey you.’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) will say: ‘O Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonouring my father?’ Then Allâh تعالى will say (to him): ‘I have forbidden Paradise for the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrâhîm (Abraham)! Look! What is underneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a Dhîkh (Hyena,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.569)."
