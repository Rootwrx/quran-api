  "translation": " 93. And who can be more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allâh, or says: \"A revelation has come to me\" whereas no revelation has come to him in anything ; and who says, \"I will reveal the like of what Allâh has revealed.\" And if you could but see when the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allâh other than the truth. And you used to reject His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) with disrespect![1]\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.6:93) A. What is said regarding the punishment in the grave. And the Statement of Allâh عز وجل:\n\"If you could but see when the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) are in the agonies of death while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): \"Deliver your souls. This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation.\" (V.6:93)\nAnd also the Statement of Allâh تعالى : \"Twice shall We punish them and thereafter, they shall be brought back to a great (horrible) torment.\" (V.9:101).\nAnd also the Statement of Allâh تعالى :\n\"While an evil torment encompassed Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)’s people; the Fire, they are exposed to it morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)’s people to enter the severest torment.’\" (V.40: 4546).\nNarrated Al-Barâ’ bin ‘Âzib: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"When a faithful believer is made to sit in his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that Lâ ilâha illallâh wa Anna Muhammad-ur-Rasuûl Allâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh and Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the Messenger of Allâh). And that corresponds to Allâh’s Statement: ‘Allâh will keep firm those who believe with the word that stands firm.’ (V.14:27).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.2, Hadîth No.450).\nB. Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"When a human being is laid in his grave and his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels come to him and make him sit and ask him: ‘What did you use to say about this man, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ?’ He will say: ‘I testify that he is Allâh’s slave and His Messenger.’ Then it will be said to him, ‘Look at your place in the Hell-Fire. Allâh has changed for you a place in Paradise instead of it.’\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"The dead person will see both his places. But a disbeliever or a hypocrite will say to the angels, ‘I do not know, but I used to say what the people used to say!’ It will be said to him, ‘Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by following the Qur’ân).’ Then he will be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will cry and that cry will be heard by whatsoever is near to him except human beings and jinn.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.2, Hadîth No.422)"
