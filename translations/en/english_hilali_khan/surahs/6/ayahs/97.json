  "translation": " 97. It is He Who has set the stars[1] for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea. We have (indeed) explained in detail Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, Revelations, etc.) for people who know.",
  "footnotes": "(V.6:97) (About the) Stars. Abu Qatâdah mentioned Allâh’s Statement: \"And We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps,\" (V.67:5) and said, \"The creation of these stars is for three purposes, i.e. as decoration of the (nearest) heaven, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travellers. So, if anybody tries to find a different interpretation, he is mistaken and just wastes his efforts, and troubles himself with what is beyond his limited knowledge.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.4, Chap. 3, P.282)."
