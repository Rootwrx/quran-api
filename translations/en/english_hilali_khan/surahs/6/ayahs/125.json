  "translation": " 125. And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not.[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.6:125) If Allâh تعالى wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion [the understanding of the Qur’ân and the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم].\nNarrated Mu‘âwiya رضي الله عنه in a Khuthah (religious talk): I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, \"If Allâh wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion [the understanding of the Qur’ân and the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم]. I am just a distributor, but the grant is from Allâh. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims, real followers of Islâmic Monotheism) will remain obedient to Allâh’s Orders [i.e., following strictly Allâh’s Book (the Qur’ân) and the Prophet’s Sunnah (legal ways)] and they will not be harmed by anyone who will oppose them (going on a different path) till Allâh’s Order (Day of Judgement) is established.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.71)."
