  "translation": " 30. And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allâh, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allâh. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allâh’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth![3]",

They do not worship them (i.e. the rabbis and monks).\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"They certainly do. [They (i.e. the rabbis and monks) made lawful things as unlawful and unlawful things as lawful, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them; and by doing so, they really worshipped them].\" (Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Jarîr)."
