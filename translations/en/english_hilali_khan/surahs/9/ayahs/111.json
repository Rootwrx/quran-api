  "translation": " 111. Verily, Allâh has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allâh’s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Qur’ân. And who is truer to his covenant than Allâh? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.9:111)\na) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh guarantees him who strives in His Cause and whose motivation for going out is nothing but Jihâd in His Cause and belief in His Words (Islamic Monotheism), that He will admit him into Paradise (if martyred) or bring him back to his dwelling place whence he has come out with what he gains of reward or booty.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.352).\nb) Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنهما : On the day of the battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and said, \"Can you tell me where I will be if I should get martyred?\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"In Paradise.\" The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand, and fought till he was martyred. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.5, Hadith No.377).\nc) Narrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying \"If you (1) practise Bai‘ Al-‘Inah (the ‘Inah transaction i.e. selling goods to a person for a certain price and then buying them back from him for a far less price); (2) and followed the tails of the cows (i.e. indulged in agriculture and became content with it), (3) and deserted the Jihâd (holy fighting) in Allâh’s Cause, Allâh will cover you with humiliation, and it will not be removed till you return back to your religion.\" (Abu Dâwûd, Vol.3, Hadith No.3462)."
