  "translation": " 38. O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of Allâh (i.e. Jihâd) you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared to the Hereafter.[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.9:38) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Nobody who dies and finds good from Allâh (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world, even if he were given the whole world and whatever is in it except the martyr who, on seeing the superiority of martyrdom would like to come back to the world and get killed again (in Allâh’s Cause).\" (Sahih Al Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.53-A)."
