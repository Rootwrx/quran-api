I asked my father why he had done so. He replied, \"The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade the acceptance of the price of a dog or blood, and also forbade the profession of tattooing, or getting tattooed and receiving or giving Ribâ (usury), and cursed the picture-makers.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 3, Hadîth No.299).\nb) Narrated Abu Juhaifah that he had bought a slave whose profession was cupping and then said: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade taking the price of blood and the price of a dog and the earnings of a prostitute, and cursed the one who took or gave Ribâ (usury), and the lady who tattooed others or got herself tattooed, and the picture-maker. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 7, Hadîth No.845)."
