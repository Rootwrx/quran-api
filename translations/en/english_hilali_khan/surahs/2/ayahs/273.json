  "translation": " 273. (Charity is) for Fuqarâ (the poor), who in Allâh’s Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land (for trade or work). The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not beg of people at all.[1] And whatever you spend in good, surely, Allâh knows it well.",
  "footnotes": " (V.2:273) The Arabic word Ilhâfa literally means: \"to beg with importunity,\" but Imâm Tabari in his Tafsir and the majority of the religious scholars agree that the Verse means: \"They do not beg of people at all.\""
