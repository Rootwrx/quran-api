  "translation": " 229. The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allâh (e.g. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allâh, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul‘ (divorce)[2]. These are the limits ordained by Allâh, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allâh, then such are the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers).",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:229) Al-Khul‘ * الخلع and how a divorce is given according to it.\nNarrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: The wife of Thâbit bin Qais came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! I do not blame Thâbit for defects in his character or his religion, but I, being a Muslim, dislike to behave in an un-Islâmic manner (if I remain with him)\". On that Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said (to her), \"Will you give back the garden which your husband has given you as Mahr )?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to Thâbit, \"O Thabît! Accept your garden, and divorce her once.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No. 197).\n* Al-Khul‘ الخلع means the parting of a wife from her husband by giving him a certain compensation."
