  "translation": " 248. And their Prophet (Samuel عليه السلام) said to them: Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tâbût (a wooden box), wherein is Sakînah [1] (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Mûsâ (Moses) and Hârûn (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.",
  "footnotes": " (V.2:248) Narrated Al-Barâ’: A man was reciting Sûrah Al-Kahf and his horse was tied with two ropes beside him. A cloud came down and spread over that man, and it kept on coming closer and closer to him till his horse started jumping (as if afraid of something). When it was morning, the man came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and told him of that experience. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"That was As-Sakînah (tranquillity or peace and reassurance along with angels), which descended because of (the recitation of) the Qur’ân.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.531)."
