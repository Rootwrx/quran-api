  "translation": " 116. And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allâh has begotten a son (children or offspring)[1]. Glory be to Him (Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him). Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, and all surrender with obedience (in worship) to Him.",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:116) \"They (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allâh has begotten a son (children, offspring). Glory be to Him ... Nay....\" Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh said, ‘The son of Adam tells lies against Me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for telling lies against Me, he claims that I cannot re-create him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me: it is his statement that I have a son (or offspring) No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or a son (or offspring).’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, Hadîth No. 9)."
