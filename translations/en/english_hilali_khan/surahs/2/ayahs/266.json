  "translation": " 266. Would any of you wish to have a garden with date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is striken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does Allâh make clear His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) to you that you may give thought.[1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.2:266) ‘Umar رضي الله عنه said, \"This is an example for a rich man who does good deeds out of obedience to Allâh, and then Allâh sends him Satan whereupon he commits sins till all his good deeds are lost.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.62)."
