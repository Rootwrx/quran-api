  "translation": " 184. [Observing Saum (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskîn (poor person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know.[2]",
  "footnotes": " (V.2:184) The provision of this Verse has been abrogated by the next Verse: 185, with few exceptions, i.e., very old person, or pregnancy, etc."
