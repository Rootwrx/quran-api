  "footnotes": "(V.18:39): What is said regarding the statement: Lâ haulâ walâ quwwata illa billâh (i.e. There is neither might nor power except with Allâh).\nNarrated Abu Mûsâ Al-Ash‘ari: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم started ascending a high place or a hill. A man (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice. Lâ ilâha illal-lahu wallâhu Akbar* (At that time) Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was riding his mule. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"You are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one.\" and added, \"O Abu Mûsâ (or, O ‘Abdullâh)! Shall I tell you a sentence from the treasure of Paradise?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said,\"Lâ haulâ walâ quwwata illa billâh\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 418).\n*None has the right to be worshipped but Allâh, and Allâh is the Most Great."
