  "translation": " 94. They said: \"O Dhul-Qarnain! Verily Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog)[1] are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.18:94) Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj [Gog and Magog (people)]: To know about them in detail - please see Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, Vol. II, Pages 55-58.\nNarrated Zainab bint Jahsh that one day Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم entered upon her in a state of fear and said, \" Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh)! Woe to the Arabs from the great evil that has approached (them). Today a hole has been opened in the dam of Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog) like this.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم made a circle with his index finger and thumb. Zainab bint Jahsh added: I said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger!, Shall we be destroyed though there will be righteous people among us?\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"Yes if Al-Khabath * (evil persons) increased.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.249).\n*The word Al-Khabath is interpreted as illegal sexual intercourse and illegitimate children and every kind of evil deed. (See Fath Al-Bari, Vol. 16, Page 225)."
