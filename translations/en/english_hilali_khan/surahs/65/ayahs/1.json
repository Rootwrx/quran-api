  "translation": "1. O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods[1]). And fear Allâh your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allâh. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allâh, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be that Allâh will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).",
  "footnotes": "(V.65:1) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم . ‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb رضي الله عنه asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم about that. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Order him (your son) to take her back and keep her till she is clean from her menses and then to wait till she gets her next period and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he can divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the ‘Iddah (prescribed period) which Allâh has fixed for the women meant to be divorced.\" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadîth No.178)."
