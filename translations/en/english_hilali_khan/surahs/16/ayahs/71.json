  "translation": " 71. And Allâh has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties. Then, those who are preferred will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof[1]. Do they then deny the Favour of Allâh?",
  "footnotes": "(V.16:71):\na) This example Allâh has set forth for the polytheists (pagans) who associate false deities with Allâh, that they would not agree to share their wealth and properties with their slaves, then how do they agree to share false deities with Allâh in His worship?\nb) Allâh’s Statement: \"And Allah ...\" (V.16:71). Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Prophet Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام emigrated with Sârah and entered a village where there was a king from amongst the kings or a tyrant from amongst the tyrants. (The king) was told that Ibrâhîm (Abraham) had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and asked, ‘O Ibrâhîm (Abraham)! Who is this lady accompanying you?’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) replied, ‘She is my sister (i.e., in religion).’ Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) returned to her and said, ‘Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my sister. By Allâh, there are not true believers on the earth except you and I.’ Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, offered Salât (prayer) and said, ‘O Allâh! If I have believed in You and Your Messenger, and have guarded my private parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.’ On that the king fell in a state of unconsciousness (or had an epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sârah said, ‘O Allâh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.’ The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, offered Salât (prayer) and said, ‘O Allâh! If I have believed in You and Your Messenger and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.’ The king again fell in a state of unconsciousness (or had epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sârah said, ‘O Allâh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.’ The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, ‘By Allâh! You have sent a Satan to me. Take her to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and give her Agar (Hagar).’ So she came back to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and said, ‘Allâh humiliated the disbeliever and gave us a slave-girl for service.’ \" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.3. Hadith No 420)."
