  "translation": " 67. For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies [e.g. slaughtering of the cattle during the three days of stay at Mîna (Makkah) during the Hajj (pilgrimage)] which they must follow; so let them (the pagans) not dispute with you on the matter (i.e. to eat of the cattle which you slaughter, and not to eat of the cattle which Allâh kills by its natural death), but invite them to your Lord. Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) indeed are on the (true) straight guidance (i.e. the true religion of Islâmic Monotheism).",
