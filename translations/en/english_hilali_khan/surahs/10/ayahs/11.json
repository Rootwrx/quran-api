  "translation": " 11. And were Allâh to hasten for mankind the evil (they invoke for themselves and for their children. while in a state of anger) as He hastens for them the good (they invoke) then they would have been ruined. So We leave those who expect not their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering blindly in distraction. (Tafsir At-Tabarî)",
