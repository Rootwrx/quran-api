  "translation": "54. And if every person who had wronged (by disbelieving in Allâh and by worshipping others besides Allâh) possessed all that is on the earth and sought to ransom himself therewith (it will not be accepted), and they would feel in their hearts regret when they see the torment, and they will be judged with justice, and no wrong will be done unto them.[1]",
