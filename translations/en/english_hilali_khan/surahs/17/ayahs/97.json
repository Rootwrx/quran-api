  "translation": " 97. And he whom Allâh guides, he is led aright; but he whom He sends astray, for such you will find no Auliyâ’ (helpers and protectors), besides Him, and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces,[1]blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.",
  "footnotes": "(V.17:97) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: A man said, \"O Allâh’s Prophet! Will Allâh gather a disbeliever (prone) on his face on the Day of Resurrection?\" He صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Will not the One Who made him walk on his feet in this world, be able to make him walk on his face on the Day of Resurrection?\" (Qatâdah, a subnarrator, said: \"Yes, by the Power of Our Lord!\") (Sahih Al Bukhri, Vol. 6, Hadith No.283)."
