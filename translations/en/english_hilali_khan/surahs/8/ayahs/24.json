  "translation": " 24. O you who believe! Answer Allâh (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) calls you[1] to that which will give you life,[2] and know that Allâh comes in between a person and his heart (i.e. He prevents an evil person to decide anything). And verily to Him you shall (all) be gathered.",
  "footnotes": "[1] (V.8:24) See the footnote of (V.1:2).\n[2] (V.8:24) i.e., one is alive, - a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) who is obedient to Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and follows the Qur’ân and Prophet’s Sunnah practically, and he goes out for Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause; in case he is martyred, that is not a death but an eternal life (in Paradise) forever, unlike to a disbeliever who is dead (as regards faith), and will be punished in Hell forever (neither alive nor dead)."
