  "translation": " 65. He is the Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He); so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only, and not to show off, and not setting up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",
