  "footnotes": "(V.81:8) Narrated Al-Mughîrah bin Shu‘bah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh has forbidden for you: (1) to be undutiful to your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters alive, (3) not to pay the rights of the others (e.g., charity), and (4) to beg of men (i.e., begging). And Allâh hates for you: (1) sinful and useless talk like backbiting, or that you talk too much about others, (2) to ask too many questions (in disputed religious matters), and (3) to waste the wealth (by extravagance with lack of wisdom and thinking).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.3, Hadith No.591)."
