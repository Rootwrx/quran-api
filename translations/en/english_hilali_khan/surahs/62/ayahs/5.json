  "translation": " 5. The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Taurât (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations) of Allâh. And Allâh guides not the people who are Zâlimûn(polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers).",
