  "translation": " 34. The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allâh orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger,[2] and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.",
