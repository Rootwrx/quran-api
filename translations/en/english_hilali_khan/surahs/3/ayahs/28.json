  "translation": " 28. Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Auliyâ (supporters, helpers) instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allâh in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allâh warns you against Himself (His punishment)[2], and to Allâh is the final return.",
  "footnotes": "(V.3:28) The Statement of Allâh عز وجل \"But Allâh warns you against Himself (i.e. His Punishment).\" (3:28).\nNarrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"There is none who has a greater sense of Ghairah * than Allâh, and for that reason He has forbidden Al-Fawâhish , (the shameful deeds and sins, e.g. illegal sexual intercourse). And there is none who likes to be praised more than Allâh does.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.500).\n* Ghairah: a feeling of great fury and anger when one’s honour and prestige are injured or challenged."
