  "translation": " 55. And (remember) when Allâh said: \"O ‘Îsâ (Jesus)! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you [of the forged statement that ‘Îsâ (Jesus) is Allâh’s son] of those who disbelieve, and I will make those who follow you (Monotheists, who worship none but Allâh) superior to those who disbelieve [in the Oneness of Allâh, or disbelieve in some of His Messengers, e.g. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, ‘Îsâ (Jesus), Mûsâ (Moses), etc., or in His Holy Books, e.g. the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Qur’ân] till the Day of Resurrection[1]. Then you will return to Me and I will judge between you in the matters in which you used to dispute.\"",
  "footnotes": "(V.3:55) The advent (descent) of ‘Îsâ (Jesus), [son of Maryam (Mary)] عليه السلام .\na) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely [‘Îsâ (Jesus)], the son of Maryam (Mary) عليه السلامwill shortly descend amongst you (Muslims), and will judge mankind justly by the law of the Qur’ân (as a just ruler); he will break the cross and kill the pigs and there will be no Jîzyah\" (i.e. taxation taken from non-Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, and a single prostration to Allâh (in prayer) will be better than the whole world and whatever is in it.\" Abu Hurairah added: \"If you wish, you can recite (this Verse of the Qur’ân): \"And there is none of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام as a Messenger of Allâh and a human being] before his [‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام or a Jew’s or Christian’s] death, and on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام] will be a witness against them.\" (4:159).\n(See Fath Al-Bari , Vol.7, Page No.302) According to the quotation of Kushmaihani there is the word Al-Jizyah * instead of Al-Harb (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.657).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"How will you be when the son of Maryam (Mary) [i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام descends amongst you, and he will judge people by the Law of the Qur’ân and not by the law of the Injeel (Gospel).\" (Fath Al-Bari, Vol.7, Pages 304 and 305) (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.658).\n* The Jizyah: a tax imposed on non-Muslims who would keep their own religion, rather than embrace Islâm) will not be accepted by ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام, but all people will be required to embrace Islâm and there will be no other alternative."
