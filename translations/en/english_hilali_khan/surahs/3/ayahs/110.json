  "translation": " 110. You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh[1]. And had the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Al-Fâsiqûn (disobedient to Allâh - and rebellious against Allâh’s Command).",
  "footnotes": "(V.3:110) a) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه The Verse:\n\"You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Sunnah], are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind\" means, the best of the people for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks till they embrace Islâm (and thereby save them from the eternal punishment in the Hell-fire and make them enter Paradise in the Hereafter). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No.80).\nb) CHAPTER 144. The prisoners of war in chains.\nNarrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, \"Allâh wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 254).*\n* The people referred to here may be the prisoners of war who were captured and chained by the Muslims and their imprisonment was the cause of their conversion to Islâm. So, it is as if their chains were the means of winning Paradise."
