  "translation": " 91. Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom[2]. For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.",
  "footnotes": "(V.3:91). Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, \"A disbeliever will be asked: ‘Suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth, would you offer it to ransom yourself (from the Hell-Fire)?’ He will reply, ‘Yes.’ Then it will be said to him, ‘You were asked for something easier than that (to join none in worship) with Allâh (i.e. to accept Islâm, but you refused.)’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 8, Hadîth No. 546)."
