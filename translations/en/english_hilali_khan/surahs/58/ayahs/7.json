  "translation": "7. Have you not seen that Allâh knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwâ[1] (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be. And afterwards on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.",
