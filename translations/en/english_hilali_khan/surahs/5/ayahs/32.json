  "translation": " 32. Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with clear proofs, evidence, and signs, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits (e.g. by doing oppression unjustly and exceeding beyond the limits set by Allâh by committing the major sins) in the land![1]",
  "footnotes": "(V.5:32) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"The biggest of Al-Kabâ’ir (the great sins) are: (1) To join others as partners in worship with Allâh, (2) to murder a human being, (3) to be undutiful to one’s parents (4) and to make a false statement,\" or said, \"to give a false witness.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.10)."
