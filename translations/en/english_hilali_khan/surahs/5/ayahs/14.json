  "translation": " 14. And from those who call themselves Christians, We took their covenant, but they have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.[1] So We planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection (when they discarded Allâh’s Book, disobeyed Allâh’s Messengers and His Orders and transgressed beyond bounds in Allâh’s disobedience); and Allâh will inform them of what they used to do.",
  "footnotes": "(V.5:14) a) The Christians were ordered in the Injeel (Gospel) to follow Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم when he would come as a Messenger of Allâh to all mankind.\n[See (V.7:157) and its footnote].\nb) See the footnote of (V.41:46)"
