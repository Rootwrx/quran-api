Abu Bakr said to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم : ‘I wish if you get aside (or go away) as she is coming, to us, she may harm you’. The Prophet said: ‘There will be a screen set between me and her’. So she did not see him صلى الله عليه وسلم. She said to Abu Bakr: ‘Your companion is saying poetry against me.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘By Allâh he does not say poetry.’ She said: ‘Do you believe that’. Then she left. Abu Bakr said, ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! She did not see you’. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘An angel was screening me from her.’\" [This Hadith is quoted in Musnad Abû Ya‘lâ]\nIt is said that if the Verse [(17: 45) The Qur’an] is recited by a real believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) he will be screened from a disbeliever. (Allâh knows best). (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubî, Vol.10, Page 269)."
