  "translation": " 23. And among His Signs is your sleep[1] by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.",
  "footnotes": "(V.30:23) It is a sign from among the Signs of Allah that a person goes to sleep; the medical world up to now does not know exactly why a person goes to sleep. There are only theories. So this Qur’ân is a miracle from Allah, and not an invented tale as the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allah) argue."
