  "translation": " 15. And he entered the city at a time of unawareness of its people: and he found there two men fighting, - one of his party (his religion - from the Children of Israel), and the other of his foes. The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe, so Mûsâ (Moses) struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: \"This is of Shaitan’s (Satan) doing: verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.\"",
