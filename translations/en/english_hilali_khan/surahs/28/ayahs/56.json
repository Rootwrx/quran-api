  "footnotes": "(V.28:56) Narrated Al-Musayyab: When Abû Tâlib was on his death bed, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went to him while Abû Jahl was sitting beside him. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"O my uncle! Say: Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah), an expression with which I will defend your case, before Allah.\" Abû Jahl and ‘Abdullâh bin Umayyah said: \"O Abû Tâlib! Will you leave the religion of ‘Abdul Muttalib?\" So they kept on saying this to him so that the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: \"I am on the religion of ‘Abdul Muttalib.\" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: \"I will keep on asking for Allah’s Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.\" Then the following Verse was revealed: \"It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s Forgiveness for the Mushrikûn even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).\" (V.9:113).\nThe other Verse was also revealed: \"Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.\" (V.28:56). (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.5, Hadîth No.223)."
