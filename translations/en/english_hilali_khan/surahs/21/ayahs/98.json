  "footnotes": "(V.21:98) When the following Statement of Allâh عز وجل was revealed: \"Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allâh are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely), you will enter it.\"\nThe Quraish pagans were delighted and said: \"We are pleased to be with our gods in the Hell-fire, as the idols will be with the idolaters (in the Hell-fire), and therefore ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary) will be with his worshippers (i.e. in the Hell-fire) and so on.\nSo (to clear the misunderstanding) Allâh عز وجل revealed the following Verse (to deny and reject their claim): \"Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell). [e.g. ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary); ‘Uzair (Ezra)].\" [The Qur’ân, Verse 21:101]."
