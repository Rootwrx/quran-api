  "translation": "(34) Men are in charge of women[182] by [right of] what Allāh has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allāh would have them guard.[183] But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance[184] - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them [lightly].[185] But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allāh is ever Exalted and Grand.",
  "footnotes": "[182]- This applies primarily to the husband-wife relationship.\n[183]- i.e., their husbands' property and their own chastity.\n[184]- i.e., major rebellion or refusal of basic religious obligations.\n[185]- This final disciplinary measure is more psychological than physical.  It may be resorted to only after failure of the first two measures and when it is expected to amend the situation and prevent family breakup; otherwise, it is not acceptable.  The Prophet ﷺ (who never struck a woman or a servant) additionally stipulated that it must not be severe or damaging and that the face be avoided."
