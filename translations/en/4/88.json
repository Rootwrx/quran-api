  "translation": "(88) What is [the matter] with you [that you are] two groups concerning the hypocrites,[206] while Allāh has made them fall back [into error and disbelief] for what they earned.[207] Do you wish to guide those whom Allāh has sent astray? And he whom Allāh sends astray - never will you find for him a way [of guidance].[208]",
  "footnotes": "[206]- i.e., divided between two viewpoints - whether or not they should be fought and killed.\n[207]- As the result of their disobedience and disloyalty.\n[208]- Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) leaves or sends astray those who choose to reject His guidance."
