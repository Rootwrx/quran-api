    "translation": "(97) Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves[212] - [the angels] will say, \"In what [condition] were you?\" They will say, \"We were oppressed in the land.\" They [the angels] will say, \"Was not the earth of Allāh spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?\" For those, their refuge is Hell - and evil it is as a destination.",
