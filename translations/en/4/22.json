  "translation": "(22) And do not marry those [women] whom your fathers married, except what has already occurred.[175] Indeed, it was an immorality and hateful [to Allāh] and was evil as a way.",
  "footnotes": "[175]- Before Islām.  After the ruling was revealed by Allāh, men were required to release those women unlawful to them (e.g., a stepmother, one of two sisters, or any wives over the limit of four).  The same obligation applies to one once he has accepted Islām."
