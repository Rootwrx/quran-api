  "translation": "(10) O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as emigrants, examine [i.e., test] them. Allāh is most knowing as to their faith. And if you know them to be believers, then do not return them to the disbelievers; they are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them. But give them [i.e., the disbelievers] what they have spent.[1676] And there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation [i.e., mahr]. And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women, but ask for what you have spent and let them [i.e., the disbelievers] ask for what they have spent.[1677] That is the judgement of Allāh; He judges between you. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[1676]- For marriage, i.e., compensate their loss.\n[1677]- When a disbelieving wife chose to join the disbelievers, a Muslim husband could demand in return the equivalent of her mahr.  Likewise, the disbelievers had a similar right when a believing woman joined the Muslims.  This and the following verses were revealed subsequent to the Treaty of al-Ḥudaybiyyah."
