    "translation": "(70) Has there not reached them the news of those before them - the people of Noah and [the tribes of] ʿAad and Thamūd and the people of Abraham and the companions [i.e., dwellers] of Madyan and the towns overturned?[492] Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. And Allāh would never have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves.",
    "footnotes": "[492]- i.e., those to which Lot was sent and which earned for themselves Allāh's punishment.  See 11:82-83."
