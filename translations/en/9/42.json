    "translation": "(42) Had it been a near [i.e., easy] gain and a moderate trip, they [i.e., the hypocrites] would have followed you, but distant to them was the journey. And they will swear by Allāh,[481] \"If we were able, we would have gone forth with you,\" destroying themselves [through false oaths], and Allāh knows that indeed they are liars.",
