  "translation": "(81) Those who remained behind[495] rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allāh and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allāh and said, \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intense in heat\" - if they would but understand.",
  "footnotes": "[495]- Literally, \"were left behind [as Allāh willed]\" due to their false excuses having been accepted by the Prophet (ﷺ).  While pleased with their assumed deception, in reality, Allāh had prevented their participation knowing of their hypocrisy and evil intent."
