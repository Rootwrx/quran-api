  "translation": "(32) Then We caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants;[1251] and among them is he who wrongs himself [i.e., sins], and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of Allāh. That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.",
