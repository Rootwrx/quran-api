    "translation": "(40) [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, \"Our Lord is Allāh.\" And were it not that Allāh checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allāh is much mentioned [i.e., praised]. And Allāh will surely support those who support Him [i.e., His cause]. Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might.",
