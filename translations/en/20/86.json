  "translation": "(86) So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved.[848] He said, \"O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise?[849] Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord descend upon you, so you broke your promise [of obedience] to me?\"",
  "footnotes": "[848]- The meaning may also be \"angry and enraged.\"\n[849]- That He would send down the Torah, containing guidance for you."
