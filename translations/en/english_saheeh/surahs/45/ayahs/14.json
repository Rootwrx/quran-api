  "translation": "(14) Say, [O Muḥammad], to those who have believed that they [should] forgive those who expect not the days of Allāh [i.e., of His retribution] so that He may recompense a people[1470] for what they used to earn.",
  "footnotes": "[1470]- In the Hereafter, where those who forgive will be rewarded and those who earned evil will be punished.  This was at the outset of daʿwah (invitation to Allāh) before permission for jihād."
