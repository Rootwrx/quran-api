  "translation": "(14) And when We decreed for him [i.e., Solomon] death, nothing indicated to them [i.e., the jinn] his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff.[1222] But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.[1223]",
  "footnotes": "[1222]- Upon which he was leaning at the time of his death.  A termite continued to gnaw into the stick until it collapsed under his weight.\n[1223]- i.e., hard labor.  This verse is evidence that the jinn do not possess knowledge of the unseen, which belongs exclusively to Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā)."
