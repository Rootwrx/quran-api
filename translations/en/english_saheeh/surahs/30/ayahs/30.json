  "translation": "(30) So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fiṭrah[1145] of Allāh upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allāh.[1146] That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.",
  "footnotes": "[1145]- The natural inborn inclination of man to worship his Creator prior to the corruption of his nature by external influences.  Thus, Islāmic monotheism is described as the religion of fiṭrah - that of the inherent nature of mankind.\n[1146]- i.e., let people remain true to their fiṭrah within the religion of Islām."
