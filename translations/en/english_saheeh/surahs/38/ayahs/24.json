  "translation": "(24) [David] said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they.\" And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord[1325] and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allāh].",
  "footnotes": "[1325]- For his errors, such as fear and suspicion of the two men at the outset, any mistake in judgement he might have made, concealed feelings of partiality, etc."
