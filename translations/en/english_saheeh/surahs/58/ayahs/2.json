  "translation": "(2) Those who pronounce ẓihār[1639] among you [to separate] from their wives - they are not [consequently] their mothers. Their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them. And indeed, they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood. But indeed, Allāh is Pardoning and Forgiving.",
  "footnotes": "[1639]- The saying by a husband to his wife, \"You are to me like the back of my mother,\" meaning unlawful to approach.  This was a type of divorce practiced by the Arabs before the prophethood of Muḥammad (ﷺ)."
