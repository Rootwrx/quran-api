  "translation": "(47) And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, \"Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?\"...[1109]",
  "footnotes": "[1109]- The conclusion of the sentence is understood to be \"...We would not have sent messengers,\" meaning that Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) sent messengers and sent Muḥammad (ﷺ) with the final scripture to mankind so that no one could claim that punishment was imposed unjustly without warning."
