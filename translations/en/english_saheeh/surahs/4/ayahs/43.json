  "translation": "(43) O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying[187] or in a state of janābah,[188] except those passing through [a place of prayer], until you have washed [your whole body]. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women [i.e., had sexual intercourse] and find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Indeed, Allāh is ever Pardoning[189] and Forgiving.",
  "footnotes": "[187]- The use of intoxicants was later prohibited completely.  See 5:90-91.\n[188]- Literally, \"distance.\"  The state of one under obligation to perform ghusl (a complete bath) due to having had sexual intercourse or ejaculation.\n[189]- Literally, able to erase and remove sins completely, leaving no trace of them in the record of deeds."
