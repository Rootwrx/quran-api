  "translation": "(92) And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment [diyah] presented to his [i.e., the deceased's] family [is required], unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if he [i.e., the deceased] was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave; and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively,[209] [seeking] acceptance of repentance from Allāh.[210] And Allāh is ever Knowing and Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[209]- Uninterrupted except when there is an Islāmically valid reason, as in Ramaḍān.\n[210]- An accidental death usually results from some degree of negligence or error for which the believer feels the need to repent."
