  "translation": "(11) Allāh instructs you concerning your children [i.e., their portions of inheritance]: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one's estate.[164] And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. And if he had brothers [and/or sisters], for his mother is a sixth,[165] after any bequest he [may have] made or debt.[166] Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is ever Knowing and Wise.",
  "footnotes": "[164]- Literally, \"that which he left.\"\n[165]- Although the siblings themselves do not inherit in this case.\n[166]- Based upon prophetic ḥadīths, scholars have ruled that debt takes precedent over a bequest, that a bequest may not include any who inherit by law, and that the total bequest may not be more than one third of one's estate.  After the fulfillment of debts and bequests (if any), the remainder of the estate is to be divided according to the ordinances in this sūrah."
