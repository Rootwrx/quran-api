  "translation": "(84) So fight, [O Muḥammad], in the cause of Allāh; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to join you] that perhaps Allāh will restrain the [military] might of those who disbelieve. And Allāh is greater in might and stronger in [exemplary] punishment.[204]",
  "footnotes": "[204]- Allāh is able to defeat them in such a way as to deter others from attempting anything similar."
