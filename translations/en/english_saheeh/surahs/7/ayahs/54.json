  "translation": "(54) Indeed, your Lord is Allāh, who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.[378] He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allāh, Lord of the worlds.",
  "footnotes": "[378]- There are several linguistic meanings of the words \"istawā ʿalā,\" among them:  to settle upon, to assume ascendancy above, and to assert authority over.  However, it is known that all the attributes of Allāh are eternal, i.e., they have always existed and were present before He created.  Thus, it cannot be said that He \"rose\" above the Throne, as Allāh has always been ascendant.  Because the Creator may not be compared to His creation, the Prophet's companions and early scholars refused speculation as to how His actions could be interpreted, considering any such attempt unlawful.  Similarly, the true nature of the Throne is known only to Allāh, the Exalted."
