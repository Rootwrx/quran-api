  "translation": "(179) And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray.[424] It is they who are the heedless.",
  "footnotes": "[424]- The reference is to their inability (i.e., refusal) to think and reason, while blindly following (as they are accustomed)."
