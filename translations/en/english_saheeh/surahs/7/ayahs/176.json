  "translation": "(176) And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby,[420] but he adhered [instead] to the earth[421] and followed his own desire. So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs.[422] So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.",
  "footnotes": "[420]- i.e., through the revelations, signs or evidences of which he had been given knowledge.\n[421]- i.e., its worldly pleasures.\n[422]- Whether or not they have been exposed to Allāh's signs or warnings, it is all the same:  they will not believe."
