  "translation": "(155) And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment.[408] And when the earthquake seized them,[409] he said, \"My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before and me [as well]. Would You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is not but Your trial by which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy upon us; and You are the best of forgivers.",
  "footnotes": "[408]- Whereupon they were to apologize to Allāh for having worshipped the calf.\n[409]- Upon reaching the appointed place, they said to Moses, \"We will not believe until we see Allāh outright.\"  So the mountain convulsed, killing them."
