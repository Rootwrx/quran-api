  "translation": "(12) Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you,[550] or is your breast constrained by it because they say, \"Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?\" But you are only a warner. And Allāh is Disposer of all things.",
  "footnotes": "[550]- Knowing of the Prophet's difficulties, Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) urges him to patience, certain that he would not fail to convey the message in its entirety."
