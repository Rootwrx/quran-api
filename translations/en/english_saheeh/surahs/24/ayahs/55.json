  "translation": "(55) Allāh has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves[1001] after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient.",
  "footnotes": "[1001]- i.e., denies the favor of Allāh or does not live by His ordinance."
