  "translation": "(11) Indeed, those who came with falsehood[978] are a group among you. Do not think it bad for you; rather, it is good for you. For every person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof[979] - for him is a great punishment [i.e., Hellfire].",
  "footnotes": "[978]- Referring to the incident when the Prophet's wife ʿĀ’ishah was falsely accused by the hypocrites.\n[979]- i.e., ʿAbdullāh bin ʿUbayy, leader of the hypocrites."
