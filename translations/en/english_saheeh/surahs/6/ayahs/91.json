  "translation": "(91) And they did not appraise Allāh with true appraisal[324] when they said, \"Allāh did not reveal to a human being anything.\" Say, \"Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light and guidance to the people? You [Jews] make it into pages, disclosing [some of] it and concealing much. And you[325] were taught that which you knew not - neither you nor your fathers.\" Say, \"Allāh [revealed it].\" Then leave them in their [empty] discourse, amusing themselves.",
  "footnotes": "[324]- i.e., they did not appreciate the extent of His ability and wisdom.\n[325]- The Jews, or it may refer to the believers, who are taught by the Qur’ān."
