  "translation": "(9) The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly - that is the Day of Deprivation.[1693] And whoever believes in Allāh and does righteousness - He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.",
  "footnotes": "[1693]- \"At-Taghābun\" suggests having been outdone by others in the acquisition of something valued.  That Day, the disbelievers will suffer the loss of Paradise to the believers."
