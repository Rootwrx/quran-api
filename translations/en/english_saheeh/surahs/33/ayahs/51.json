  "translation": "(51) You, [O Muḥammad], may put aside whom you will of them[1206] or take to yourself whom you will. And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. That is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them. And Allāh knows what is in your hearts. And ever is Allāh Knowing and Forbearing.",
  "footnotes": "[1206]- Those mentioned in the previous verse as being lawful to the Prophet (ﷺ) or his wives to which he was married."
