  "translation": "(17) And you did not kill them, but it was Allāh who killed them.[440] And you threw not, [O Muḥammad], when you threw, but it was Allāh who threw[441] that He might test the believers with a good test.[442] Indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",
  "footnotes": "[440]- i.e., Your strength was insufficient to overcome them, but Allāh supported you and gave you victory.\n[441]- When the Prophet (ﷺ) threw a handful of dust into the faces of the disbelievers, Allāh caused it to fill the eyes and nose of every soldier, preventing their advance.\n[442]- So that they would appreciate Allāh's favor to them."
