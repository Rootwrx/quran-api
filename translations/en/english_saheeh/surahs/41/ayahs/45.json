  "translation": "(45) And We had already given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement.[1399] And if not for a word [i.e., decree][1400] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the Qur’ān], in disquieting doubt.",
