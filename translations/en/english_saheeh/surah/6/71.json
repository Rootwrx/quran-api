    "translation": "(71) Say, \"Shall we invoke[317] instead of Allāh that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after Allāh has guided us? [We would then be] like one whom the devils enticed [to wander] upon the earth confused, [while] he has companions inviting him to guidance, [calling], 'Come to us.'\"[318] Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of Allāh is the [only] guidance; and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds.",
    "footnotes": "[317]- i.e., worship.\n[318]- The example given is of one who has lost his way and is further confused by the evil ones who tempt him to follow various directions, all leading to destruction.  Although his sincere friends call him back to the right path, he ignores them."
