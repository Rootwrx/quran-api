  "translation": "(5) The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on[1687] is like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books].[1688] Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of Allāh. And Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
  "footnotes": "[1687]- i.e., neglected their responsibility towards it by not putting its teachings into practice.\n[1688]- But does not benefit from their contents."
