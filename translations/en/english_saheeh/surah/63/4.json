  "translation": "(4) And when you see them, their forms please you, and if they speak, you listen to their speech. [They are] as if they were pieces of wood propped up[1690] - they think that every shout is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allāh destroy them; how are they deluded?",
  "footnotes": "[1690]- i.e., bodies with empty minds and empty hearts."
