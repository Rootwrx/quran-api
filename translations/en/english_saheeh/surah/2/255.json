  "translation": "(255) Allāh - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,[98] the Self-Sustaining.[99] Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[100] and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursī[101] extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High,[102] the Most Great.[103]",
  "footnotes": "[98]- Whose life is perfect, complete and eternal, without beginning or end, and through whom all created life originated and continues.\n[99]- Dependent on none for His existence while being the sustainer and administrator of all created existence.\n[100]- Allāh's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, present and future.\n[101]- Chair or footstool. It is not to be confused with al-ʿArsh (the Throne) , which is infinitely higher and greater than al-Kursī.\n[102]- Above all of His creations and superior to them in essence, rank and position.\n[103]- Whose greatness is unlimited, beyond description or imagination."
