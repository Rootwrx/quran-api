  "translation": "(142) The foolish among the people will say, \"What has turned them away from their qiblah,[50] which they used to face?\"[51] Say, \"To Allāh belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.\"",
  "footnotes": "[50]- The direction faced in prayer.\n[51]- Prior to the command (in verse 144) that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his followers turn toward the Kaʿbah in Makkah for prayer, they had been facing Jerusalem to the north. The implications of this change are mentioned in succeeding verses."
