  "translation": "(104) O you who have believed, say not [to Allāh's Messenger], \"Rāʿinā\" but say, \"Unẓurnā\"[35] and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[35]- The word \"rāʿinā\" in Arabic literally means \"consider us,\" i.e., give us time to hear you and listen to us. The Jews used to use the same word with the meaning of an insult. Therefore, the believers were ordered to avoid this expression and use instead the word \"unẓurnā,\" i.e., \"wait for us [so that we may understand].\""
