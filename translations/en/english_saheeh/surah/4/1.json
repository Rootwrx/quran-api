    "translation": "(1) O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allāh, through whom[156] you ask one another,[157] and the wombs.[158] Indeed Allāh is ever,[159] over you, an Observer.[160]",
    "footnotes": "[156]- In whose name.\n[157]- i.e., request favors and demand rights.\n[158]- i.e., fear Allāh in regard to relations of kinship.\n[159]- When used in conjunction with Allāh's attributes, the word \"ever\" (occurring repeatedly throughout this sūrah and elsewhere, such as in sūrah al-Aḥzāb) is quite inadequate in imparting the sense of continuation expressed by the word \"kāna\" in Arabic, which indicates \"always was, is, and always will be.\"\n[160]- Ever-present and taking account of everything."
