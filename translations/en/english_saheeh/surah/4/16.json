    "translation": "(16) And the two[171] who commit it [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] among you - punish [i.e., dishonor] them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, Allāh is ever Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.",
    "footnotes": "[171]- Scholars differ over whether \"the two\" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., homosexuals) or those of opposite sexes.  In either case, later rulings outlined in the sunnah have replaced this one."
