  "translation": "(15) Those who commit immorality [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify,[169] confine them [i.e., the guilty women] to houses until death takes them or Allāh ordains for them [another] way.[170]",
  "footnotes": "[169]- The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.\n[170]- The \"other way\" (i.e., penalty) was later revealed in 24:2, canceling the ruling in this verse."
