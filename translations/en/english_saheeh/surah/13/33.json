  "translation": "(33) Then is He who is a maintainer of every soul, [knowing] what it has earned, [like any other]? But to Allāh they have attributed partners. Say, \"Name them. Or do you inform Him of that[641] which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent [i.e., alleged] of speech?\"[642] Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allāh sends astray - there will be for him no guide.",
  "footnotes": "[641]- i.e., other \"deities.\"\n[642]- i.e., your attributing of divinity to other than Allāh."
