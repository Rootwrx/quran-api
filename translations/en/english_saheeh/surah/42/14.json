  "translation": "(14) And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And if not for a word[1413] that preceded from your Lord [postponing the penalty] until a specified time, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, those who were granted inheritance of the Scripture after them are, concerning it, in disquieting doubt.",
