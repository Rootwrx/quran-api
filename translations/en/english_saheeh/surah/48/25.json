  "translation": "(25) They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al-Masjid al-Ḥarām while the offering[1516] was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice. And if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know - that you might trample [i.e., kill] them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without [your] knowledge - [you would have been permitted to enter Makkah]. [This was so] that Allāh might admit to His mercy whom He willed. If they had been apart [from them], We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment",
  "footnotes": "[1516]- i.e., seventy camels intended for sacrifice and feeding of the poor."
