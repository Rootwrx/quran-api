  "translation": "(25) Indeed, those who have disbelieved and avert [people] from the way of Allāh and [from] al-Masjid al-Ḥarām, which We made for the people - equal are the resident therein and one from outside - and [also] whoever intends [a deed] therein[922] of deviation [in religion] by wrongdoing - We will make him taste of a painful punishment.",
  "footnotes": "[922]- Whether inside its boundaries or intending from afar to do evil therein.  The Ḥaram is unique in that the mere intention of sin therein (whether or not it is actually carried out) is sufficient to bring punishment from Allāh."
