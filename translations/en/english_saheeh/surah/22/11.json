  "translation": "(11) And of the people is he who worships Allāh on an edge.[917] If he is touched by good, he is reassured by it; but if he is struck by trial, he turns on his face [to unbelief]. He has lost [this] world and the Hereafter. That is what is the manifest loss.",
  "footnotes": "[917]- At the edge of his religion, so to speak, i.e., with uncertainty, hypocrisy or heedlessness."
