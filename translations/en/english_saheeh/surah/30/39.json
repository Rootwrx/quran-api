  "translation": "(39) And whatever you give for interest [i.e., advantage] to increase within the wealth of people[1149] will not increase with Allāh. But what you give in zakāh,[1150] desiring the face [i.e., approval] of Allāh - those are the multipliers.[1151]",
  "footnotes": "[1149]- The phrase includes several connotations, among them:  a) that which is given as usury or interest, b) that which is given on the condition that it be repaid with interest, and c) a gift given with the intention of obtaining from the recipient greater benefit or a larger gift.\n[1150]- The meaning of ṣadaqah (voluntary charity) is included here.\n[1151]- Of their blessings on earth and their rewards in the Hereafter."
