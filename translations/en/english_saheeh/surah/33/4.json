    "translation": "(4) Allāh has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful[1180] your mothers. And He has not made your claimed [i.e., adopted] sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allāh says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.",
    "footnotes": "[1180]- By the expression \"You are to me like the back of my mother.\"  Such an oath taken against approaching one's wife was a pre-Islāmic practice declared by Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) to be a sin requiring expiation as described in 58:3-4."
