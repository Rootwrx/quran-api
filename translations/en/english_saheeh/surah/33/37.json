    "translation": "(37) And [remember, O Muḥammad], when you said to the one on whom Allāh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor,[1198] \"Keep your wife and fear Allāh,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allāh is to disclose.[1199] And you feared the people,[1200] while Allāh has more right that you fear Him.[1201] So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed [i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of Allāh accomplished.",
    "footnotes": "[1198]- Referring to the Prophet's freed slave, Zayd bin Ḥārithah.\n[1199]- i.e., Allāh's command to the Prophet (ﷺ) to marry Zaynab after Zayd divorced her.  This was to demonstrate that a man may marry a woman formerly married to his adopted son.\n[1200]- i.e., feared their saying that the Prophet (ﷺ) had married the (former) wife of his son (which is prohibited by Allāh in the case of a true, begotten son).\n[1201]- By making known His command."
