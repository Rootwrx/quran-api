  "translation": "(78) He said, \"I was only given it because of knowledge I have.\" Did he not know that Allāh had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation [of wealth]? But the criminals, about their sins, will not be asked.[1119]",
  "footnotes": "[1119]- There will be no need to enumerate their sins separately, as their quantity is obvious and more than sufficient to warrant punishment in Hell."
