  "translation": "(22) They [i.e., people] will say there were three, the fourth of them being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say, [O Muḥammad], \"My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument[785] and do not inquire about them among [the speculators] from anyone.\"",
  "footnotes": "[785]- i.e., one from the Qur’ān, which is the only sure argument."
