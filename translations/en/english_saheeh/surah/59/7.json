    "translation": "(7) And what Allāh restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns - it is for Allāh and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives[1654] and orphans and the needy and the [stranded] traveler[1655] - so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you. And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allāh; indeed, Allāh is severe in penalty.",
    "footnotes": "[1654]- Those of Banū Hāshim and Banū Muṭṭalib, whom he (ﷺ) had prohibited from accepting zakāh.\n[1655]- This ruling concerning properties abandoned by an enemy without a war effort differs from that in Sūrah al-Anfāl, verse 41, which refers to spoils of war in which four fifths is distributed among those who fought in Allāh's cause."
