    "translation": "(9) And [also for] those who were settled in the Home [i.e.,al-Madīnah] and [adopted] the faith before them.[1656] They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what they [i.e., the emigrants] were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful.",
