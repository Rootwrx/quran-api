    "translation": "(15) So to that [religion of Allāh] invite, [O Muḥammad],[1414] and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say, \"I have believed in what Allāh has revealed of scripture [i.e., the Qur’ān], and I have been commanded to do justice among you. Allāh is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you your deeds.[1415] There is no [need for] argument between us and you.[1416] Allāh will bring us together, and to Him is the [final] destination.\"",
    "footnotes": "[1414]- Another meaning understood from the Arabic is \"So because of that [division and separation into sects], invite [them back to Allāh]...\"\n[1415]- i.e., the consequences thereof.\n[1416]- Since the truth has been made clear and since those who refuse it do so only out of stubbornness or worldly interests."
