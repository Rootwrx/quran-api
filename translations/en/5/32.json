  "translation": "(32) Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul[258] or for corruption [done] in the land[259] - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one[260] - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And Our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.[261]",
  "footnotes": "[258]- i.e., in legal retribution for murder.\n[259]- i.e., that requiring the death penalty.\n[260]- Or refrains from killing.\n[261]- Heedless of Allāh's limits, negligent of their responsibilities."
