  "translation": "(75) The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food.[277] Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.",
  "footnotes": "[277]- They were in need of sustenance, proving that they were creations of Allāh, not divine beings."
