  "text": "(He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (to go forth from their homes) and fortresses (unto the first exile) because they are the first to be gathered and exiled from Medina to Historic Syria, and specifically to Jericho and Adhri'at, as a result of breaking their covenants with the Prophet (pbuh) after the battle of Uhud. (Ye deemed not) you did not have any hope, O group of believers, (that they) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (would go forth) from Medina to Historic Syria, (while they) the Banu'l-Nadir (deemed that their strongholds) their fortresses (would protect them from Allah) from Allah's chastisement. (But Allah reached them) Allah punished them and humiliated them through the killing of Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf (from a place whereof they reckoned not) they did not think that Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf would be killed nor did they have any fear regarding this, (and cast terror in their hearts) fear from Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions, when they did not fear them at all before this (so that they ruined their houses) some of their houses (with their own hands) and throw its stones on the believers (and the hands of the believers) and they left some of their homes to the believers who destroyed them and threw their stones at them. (So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!) learn a lesson, O you who have insight in Religion, from what Allah has done to them concerning their exile."
