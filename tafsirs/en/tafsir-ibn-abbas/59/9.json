  "text": "Then the Prophet (pbuh) to the Helpers (al-Ansar): \ufffdThese spoils and gardens are solely for the poor among the Emigrants. If you wish, I will divide your wealth and properties on the Emigrants and give you a share of the spoils, or you keep your wealth and properties and I divide the spoils on the poor among the Emigrants\ufffd. They said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah, we would like to share our wealth and properties with them and we will also prefer them over ourselves and let them have the spoils\ufffd. Allah praised them for this by saying: (Those who entered the city) those who made it possible for the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions to live in the abode of migration (and the faith before them) and were believers before the Immigrants came to them (love these who flee unto them for refuge) in Medina from among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) (and find in their breasts) in their hearts (no need) no resentful envy; and it is said this means: no vexation (for that which hath been given them) of spoils, while they did not get any, (but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves) with their wealth and homes (though poverty become their lot. And whoso is saved from his own avarice) and whoever drives away avarice from his own self (such are they who are successful) such are they who are saved from Allah's wrath and chastisement."
