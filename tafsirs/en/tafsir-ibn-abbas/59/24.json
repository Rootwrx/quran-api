  "text": "(He is Allah, the Creator) of sperms in the loins of fathers, (the Shaper out of naught) Who transforms them from one state to another, (the Fashioner) of what is in the wombs: i.e. whether it is a male or female, felicitous or damned; it is also said that this means: He Who places the spirit in the living being. (His are the most beautiful names) the most exalted attributes: knowledge, power, sight, hearing, etc., so call upon Him through these attributes. (All that is in the heavens) of creation (and the earth) all that is possessed of life (glorifieth Him) prays to Him; and it is also said this means: remembers Him, (and He is the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped except Him'."
