(And let every soul) whether it is righteous or sinful (look to that which it sendeth on before for the morrow) to what it achieved for the Day of Judgement, for it will only find on the Day of Judgement that which it has performed in the life of the world; if it is good, it is good, and if it is evil, it is evil. (And observe your duty to Allah) and fear Allah! (Lo! Allah is informed of what ye do) of good and evil."
