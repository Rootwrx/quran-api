  "text": "Allah then said: (And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection of individuals of the jinn so that they increased them) because of that (in revolt (against Allah)) in pride, arrogance, sedition, and corruption. This is because they were afraid of them whenever they travelled, caught a game or camped in a valley. And to avoid their harm they used to say: \ufffdwe seek refuge in the master of this valley from the foolish ones of his folk\ufffd after which they felt safe. As a result, the masters of these places increased in nothing but pride and arrogance towards the communality among their folk. There are three kinds of jinn: one kind flies in the air; another kind ascends and descends wherever they wish; and a third kind resembles dogs and snakes;"
