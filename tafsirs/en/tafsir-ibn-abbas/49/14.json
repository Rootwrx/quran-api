  "text": "(The wandering Arabs say: We believe) this was revealed about Banu Asad who had suffered a very hard year and consequently joined Islam and moved with all their families and children to Medina to benefit from the Prophet's donations. But their presence in Medina caused a rise in the price of foodstuffs and the streets of Medina became full of their impurities. In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us\ufffd. When Allah mentioned their claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: \ufffdWe are genuine in our faith in Allah and His Messenger\ufffd. But Allah said: (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faith in Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say \ufffdWe submit\ufffd) we submit so that we may be spared from the sword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith have not entered your hearts. (Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger) inwardly as you obey him outwardly and repent of inward disbelief and hypocrisy, (He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) your deeds) He will not diminish the reward of your works. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repent of you, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant."
