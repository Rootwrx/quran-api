  "text": "(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Shun much suspicion) this was revealed about two Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, the Servant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion about others, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) for some ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not) and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; and this is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting your brother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant."
