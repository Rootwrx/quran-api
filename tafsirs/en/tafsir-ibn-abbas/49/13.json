  "text": "(O mankind!) This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who said to a man: \ufffdYou are the son of so-and-so\ufffd in reference to his mother; and it is also said that it was revealed about Bilal the muezzin of the Prophet (pbuh). When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men from Quraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: \ufffdDid Allah and His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven\ufffd. In response, Allah said: (Lo! We have created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you) in the Hereafter, (in the sight of Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (is the best in conduct) in the life of the world; which in this case is Bilal. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of your status and lineage, (Aware) of your works and standing in His sight."
