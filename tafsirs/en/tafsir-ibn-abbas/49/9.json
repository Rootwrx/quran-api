  "text": "(And if two parties of believers fall to fighting) this was revealed about the hypocrite 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul and his host and 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah, a true believer, and his companions; these two parties fell to fighting after an exchange of words, and so Allah forbade them from fighting each other and commanded them to make up, saying, (And if two parties of believers fall to fighting then make peace between them) by referring to the Book of Allah. (And if one party of them) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul (doeth wrong to) persists and transgresses against (the other) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah al-Ansari, and refuses to make peace by referring the matter to the Qur'an, (fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah) until it accepts to make peace by referring to the ordinances of the Qur'an; (then, if it return) if it accepts to make peace by referring the matter to the Book of Allah, (make peace between them justly, and act equitably) towards both parties. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) Allah loves those who judge justly by the Book of Allah, and act upon it."
