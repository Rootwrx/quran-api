  "text": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah): '(O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah) do not start with any word or action until the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) commands or prohibits you first; it is also said that this means: do not start immolating your sacrifices on the day of immolation (and His messenger) until you receive Allah's command and the command of His Messenger; it is also said that this means: do not oppose the Messenger; and it is said this means: do not contravene the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in relation to saying or doing anything without the command of Allah or of His Messenger, and do not oppose the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your works. This was revealed about three prophetic Companions who killed two men from Banu Salim when the Muslims had a peace treaty with them, without being commanded to do so by Allah or by His Messenger. Allah, glorified and Exalted is He, forbade them from engaging in any matter without a command from Allah or His Messenger."
