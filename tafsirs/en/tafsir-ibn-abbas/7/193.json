(Whether you call them) to Allah's divine Oneness (or are silent is all one to them) the disbelievers will not follow you regarding Allah's divine Oneness; it is also said: O group of disbelievers, if you call the idols to the Truth, they will not answer: it is the same whether you call them or not, because they are not living but dead."
