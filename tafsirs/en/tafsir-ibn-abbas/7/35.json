If messengers of your own) human beings like you (come unto you who narrate) recite (unto you My revelations) explaining commands and prohibitions, (then whosoever refraineth from evil) whosoever believes in the Scripture and messenger (and amendeth) that which is between him and his Lord (there shall no fear) regarding torment (come upon them neither shall they grieve) about missing Paradise."
