(Remember how He made you vicegerents after Noah's folk) after the destruction of the people of Noah, (and gave you growth of stature) the virtue of heights and bodies. (Remember (all) the bounties of your Lord) and believe in Him, (that haply ye may be successful) that haply you may escape Allah's wrath and torment."
