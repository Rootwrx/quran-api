  "text": "(As for the good land) which is not a swamp, (its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord) by the will of its Lord without toil or effort, just as the sincere believer fulfils that which Allah commands him to do voluntarily and with the good disposition of his soul; (while as for that which is bad) the bad, swampy land, (only the useless cometh forth (from it)) its vegetation comes forth only with toil and great effort. The hypocrite does not perform that which Allah commands him to do except when compelled and without a good disposition of the soul. (Thus do We recount the tokens) We expound the Qur'an by giving the simile of the believer and the disbeliever (for people who give thanks) for people who believe."
