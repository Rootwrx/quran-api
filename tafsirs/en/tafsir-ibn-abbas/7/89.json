(It is not for us) it is not permissible for us (to return to it) to embrace your religion: associating others with Allah (unless Allah should (so) will) unless Allah takes away the knowledge from our hearts. (Our Lord comprehendeth all things in knowledge) our Lord knows everything. (In Allah do we put our trust. Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Decide with truth) with justice (between us and our folk, for Thou art the best of those who make decision) the best of judges."
