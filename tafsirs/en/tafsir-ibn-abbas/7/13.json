(It is not for thee) you ought not (to show pride here) demonstrate pride, in the form of an angel, to the Children of Adam, (so go forth!) leave your angelic form; it is also said that this means: go forth from the earth; (Lo! thou art of those degraded) you are of those who are humiliated in that you are punished."
