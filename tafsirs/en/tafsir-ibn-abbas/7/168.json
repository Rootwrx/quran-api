(Some of them are righteous) nine tribes and a half, beyond the River al-Raml, (and some far from that) the rest of the believers from among the Children of Israel; it is also said that this means: and far from that are the disbelievers of the Children of Israel. (And We have tried them with good things) and We have tested them with land fertility, abundance and comfort (and evil things) drought, lack of harvest and hardship (that haply they might return) they might repent of their transgression and disbelief."
