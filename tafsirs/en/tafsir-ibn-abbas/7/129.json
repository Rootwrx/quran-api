(He) Moses (said: it may be) the expression 'may be' ['asa] when used in relation to Allah denotes categoricalness (that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary) Pharaoh and by means of drought and hunger (and make you vicegerents in the earth) make you in the inhabitants of the land of Egypt, (that He may see how ye behave) with regard to obeying Him."
