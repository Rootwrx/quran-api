Let not Satan) Iblis (seduce you) make you slip with regard to obeying Me (as he caused your (first) parents) Adam and Eve (to go forth from the Garden and tore off) took away (from them their robe) the robe of light (that he might manifest their shame to them. Lo! he) Iblis (seeth you, he and his tribe) his soldiers, (from whence ye see him not) because your breasts are their dwellings. (Lo! We have made the devils protecting friends) helpers (for those who believe not) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."
