  "text": "(And when a community) a group (among them said: Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about to destroy) by turning them into animals (and punish with an awful doom) with the Fire, (they said: In order to be free from guilt before your Lord) in order to have an argument before your Lord, (and that haply they may ward off (evil)) ward off taking the fish on the Sabbath. These were three people who used to catch fish on the Sabbath and encouraged others to do so too. There was another group of people who did not catch fish on the Sabbath but did not warn others against doing so. And lastly there was another group of people who did not catch the fish on the Sabbath and warned others against doing so. Allah turned those who caught fish on the Sabbath and enjoined others to do so into animals and spared the others."
