  "text": "(Recite unto them) O Muhammad (the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations) the greatest divine name, (but he sloughed them off) the reference here is to Bal'am Ibn Ba'ura' whom Allah honoured with His greatest name but he used to pray against Moses and so Allah took it away from him. It is also said that the reference here is to Umayyah Ibn al-Salt whom Allah honoured with knowledge and good speech but when he did not believe, Allah took this away from him, (so Satan overtook him) Satan deluded him (and he became of those who lead astray) he became of the erring disbelievers."
