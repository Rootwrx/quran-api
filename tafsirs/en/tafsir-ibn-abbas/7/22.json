(And when they tasted of the tree their shame) their nakedness (was manifest to them and they began) out of shame (to hide (by heaping) on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden) the leaves of the fig tree. (And their Lord called them) O Adam and Eve, ((saying): Did I not forbid you from that tree) from eating of that tree (and tell you: Lo! Satan) Iblis (is an open enemy to you) whose enmity is quite manifest?"
