(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when the fulfilment thereof) when the consequence of what Allah has promised them in the Qur'an (cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof) those who did not believe in it in the life of this world (will say: The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth!) with the exposition of the resurrection, Paradise and hell but we denied all. (Have we any intercessors, that they may intercede for us) to avoid the torment? (Or can we be returned) to life on earth, (that we may act) that we may believe and act (otherwise than we used to act) of idolatry? (They have lost their souls) by missing Paradise and abiding in hell, (and that which they devised) that which they worshipped falsely (hath failed them)."
