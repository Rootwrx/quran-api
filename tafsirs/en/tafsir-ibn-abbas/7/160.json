  "text": "(We divided them into twelve tribes, nations) tribe by tribe: nine tribes and a half towards the East, where the sun rises, beyond China, on the river al-Raml (also called Jordan), and two tribes and a half all over the world; (and We inspired Moses) We commanded Moses, (when his people asked him for water) in the wilderness, (saying: Smite with thy staff) which is with you (the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom) from the rock (twelve springs) rivers, (so that each tribe knew their drinking place) from the river. (And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them) in the wilderness: in the day it protected them from the sun and in the night, it lit for them like a lamp (and sent down for them the manna and the quails) in the wilderness ((saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you): the manna and the quails. (They wronged Us not) they did not hurt or harm Us because of what they committed, (but they were wont to wrong themselves) to harm and hurt themselves."
