  "text": "(So We sent them) Allah inflicted upon them (the flood) continuous, uninterrupted rain: day and night, from Saturday to Saturday (and the locusts) He sent on the locust which ate everything that the earth produced: vegetation and fruits (and the vermin) and He also inflicted them with the vermin-crawling creatures without wings-which devoured whatever the locusts left uneaten (and the frogs) and after this He set on them frogs so much so that they harmed them (and the blood) after which He inflicted on them blood such that their wells and rivers filled with blood (a succession of clear signs) of one month interval. (But they were arrogant) and refused to believe (and became guilty) idolaters."
