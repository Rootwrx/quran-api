  "text": "(And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved) when he heard the voice of sedition, (he said: Evil is that (course) which ye took after I had left you) evil is what you did by worshipping the calf after I went to the mountain. (Would ye hasten on the judgement of your Lord) would you hasten by worshipping the calf the promise of your Lord? (And he cast down the tablets) from his hand and two of them were broken, (and he seized his brother by the head) i.e. by Aaron's hair, (dragging him towards him. He) Aaron (said: Son of my mother!) they were full brothers, but he mentioned their mother so that Moses might be gentle with him (Lo! the folk did judge me weak) humiliated me (and almost killed me) due to my opposition. (Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph over me) make not the enemy, the folk of the calf, spite me (and place me not among the evil-doers!) do not harm me because of the folk of the calf."
