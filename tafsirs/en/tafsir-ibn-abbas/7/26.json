We have revealed unto you) We have created and given you (raiment) clothes of cotton, wool and fur (to conceal your shame) your nakedness, (and splendid vesture) properties and stuff, that is the furniture of the house, (but the raiment of restraint from evil) the raiment of profession of Allah's divine Oneness and of abstinence, (that is best) better than the raiment of cotton. (This) the raiment of cotton (is of the revelations of Allah) of the marvels of Allah, (that they may remember) take admonition."
