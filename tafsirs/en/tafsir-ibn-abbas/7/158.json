There is no God save Him) there is no Provider save Him. (He quickeneth) for the resurrection (and He giveth death) in the life of this world. (So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His words) in the Qur'an; or, according to another Qur'anic variant: in Jesus, who became a created being with a word, Be, and he was (and follow him) follow the religion of Muhammad (pbuh) (that haply ye may be led aright) in order that you be guided from error to faith."
