Have ye (too)) O people of the Fire (found that which your Lord promised) of torment and humiliation to be (the Truth? They say: Yea, verily. And a crier in between them) between the people of Paradise and the people of hell (crieth: The curse of Allah) the torment of Allah (is on evil-doers) on the disbelievers."
