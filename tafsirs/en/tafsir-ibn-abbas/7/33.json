  "text": "(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord forbids only indecencies) adultery, (such of them as are apparent) open adultery (and such as are within) taking secret lovers, (and sin) intoxicants as the poet said: I sipped sin until my mind erred, Thus indeed does sin take away minds. I openly drank urns of sin, And between us benefiting, you see your goddess; (and wrongful oppression) unlawful overbearingness, (and that you associate with Allah that for which no warrant) no Scripture or proof (hath been revealed, and that ye tell concerning Allah that which ye know not) of forbidding crops and cattle, good things and raiment."
