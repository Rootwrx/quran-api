  "text": "(They) the people of Mecca (ask thee) O Muhammad (of the (destined) Hour) about the timing and occurrence of the Last Hour, (when will it come to port. Say: Knowledge thereof) the knowledge of its timing and occurrence (is with my Lord only) is from my Lord. (He alone will manifest it at its proper time) none but He manifests its occurrence and timing. (It is heavy in the heavens and the earth) the knowledge of its occurrence and timing is heavy on the dwellers of the heavens and earth. (It cometh not to you save unawares) except all of a sudden. (They question thee) O Muhammad about the Hour (as if thou couldst be well informed thereof) as if you have knowledge of its timing; it is also said that this means: as if you are ignorant of it; as it is said that this means: as if you are oblivious to it. (Say) O Muhammad: (Knowledge thereof) knowledge of its occurrence and timing (is with Allah only) from Allah only, (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (know not) nor believe in it."
