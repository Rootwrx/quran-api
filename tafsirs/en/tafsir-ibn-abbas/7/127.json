  "text": "(The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: (O King), wilt thou) not kill them and (suffer Moses and his people to make mischief in the land) by changing the religion and worship, (and flout thee) and abandon you (and thy gods) and the worship of your gods; it is also said that this means, according to a different reading: and leave worshipping you as a god? (He) Pharaoh (said: We will slay their sons) their young sons, as we did the first time (and spare) and use (their women) their grown up women, (for lo! we are in power over them) we have dominance and supremacy over them."
