  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (For myself I have no power to benefit) to bring benefit, (nor power to hurt) to drive away harm, (save that which Allah willeth) to do with me of benefit or harm. (Had I knowledge of the Unseen) benefit and harm, (I should have abundance of wealth) of benefit, (and adversity) harm (would not touch me) it is also said that this means: if I knew when punishment would descend upon you, I would do good in abundance out of gratitude and no grief or sadness for you would touch me because of it; it is also said that this means: If I knew when I was to die, I would do good and perform righteous works in abundance and hardship would not touch me; it is also said that this means: If I knew the timing of droughts, lack of harvest and of rises in prices, I would amass good in abundance and hardship would not touch me. (I am but a warner) of the Fire, (and a bearer of good tidings) of Paradise (unto folk who believe) in Paradise and hell."
