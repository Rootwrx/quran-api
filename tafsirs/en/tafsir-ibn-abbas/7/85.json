  "text": "(And unto Midian) and We sent to Midian (their brother) their prophet (Shu'ayb. He said: O my people! Serve Allah) profess Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other God save Him) save Him in whom I am enjoining you to believe. (Lo! a clear proof) an exposition (hath come unto you from your Lord) regarding Allah's message; (so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind in their goods, and work not confusion in the earth) by committing transgressions and calling to other than Allah and by not giving full measure and full weight (after the fair ordering thereof) through acts of obedience, calling to Allah and giving full measure and scale. (That) the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and giving full measure and weight (will be better for you) than that in which you are now, (if ye are believers) in what I say to you."
