Pray for us unto your Lord) ask your Lord for us, (because He hath a covenant with thee) because of that with which He has commanded you. (If thou removest the terror from us) if you remove the punishment from us (we verily will trust thee) we will believe in you (and will let the Children of Israel go with thee) with all their property."
