  "text": "(And We remove whatever rancour) resentful envy or enmity (may be in their hearts) in the life of this world. (Rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow beneath them) beneath their habitations and beds in the Hereafter. (And they say) when they reach their habitations; and it is said: when they reach the source of life: (The praise to Allah) gratitude and benevolence are Allah's, (Who hath guided us to this) to this habitation and source. (We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us) to it; it is also said that when they see Allah's favour when He bestowed faith upon them, they said: praise and thanks are due to Allah Who has guided us to the religion of Islam, and we would not have been guided to the religion of Islam had not Allah guided us to it. (Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth) they brought truth, glad tiding, reward and favour. (And it is cried unto them: This is the Garden. Ye inherit it) you were given it (for what ye used to do) and say of good things in the life of this world."
