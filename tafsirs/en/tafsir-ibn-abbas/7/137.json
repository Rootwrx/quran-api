(And the fair word of the Lord) to reward them with Paradise or victory (was fulfilled) became incumbent (for the Children of Israel because of their endurance) in the face of affliction; it is also said: for their endurance upon their religion; (and We annihilated) destroyed ((all) that Pharaoh and his folk had done) of castles and townships (and that they had contrived) and that which they had planted of trees and vines; it is also said that this means: that which they had built."
