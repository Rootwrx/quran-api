(And set your faces) turn with your faces, (upright (towards Him) at every place of worship) upon every prayer (and call upon Him) worship Him, (making religion pure for Him (only)) sincere in your worship of Him and in professing His divine Oneness. (As He brought you into being) on the Day of the Covenant: felicitous and damned, knower and denier, believer and disbeliever, (so return you (unto Him)) in that state."
