Ye choose castles) for the summer (in the plains) using their mud (and hew the mountains into dwellings) for the winter. (So remember (all) the bounties of Allah) and believe in Him (and do not evil, making mischief in the earth) do not commit transgressions on the earth and call to other than Allah."
