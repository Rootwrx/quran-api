He will enjoin on them that which is right) Allah's divine Oneness and moral excellence (and forbid them that which is wrong) disbelief and hurting others. (He will make lawful for them all good things) he explains to them the lawfulness of that which is in the Scripture such as the meat and milk of camels, sheep and others (and prohibit for them only the foul) he explains to them the unlawfulness of what is in the Scripture such as carrion, the meat of swine and other things; (and he will relieve them of their burden) their pledges the breaking of which made good things unlawful for them (and the fetters) the hardships (that they used to wear) such as tearing up their clothes and other things. (Then those who believe in him) in Muhammad (pbuh) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (and honour him) and assist him (and help him) with the sword, (and follow the light) the Qur'an (which is sent down with him) which was sent with Gabriel: that which is lawful, they declared lawful, and that which unlawful, they declared unlawful: (they are the successful) who are saved from Allah's wrath and torment."
