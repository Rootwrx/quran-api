Every time a nation) the adherents of a religion (entereth, it curseth its sister (nation)) that went in before it (till, when they have all) from the first to the last (been made to follow one another thither) and all gather in the Fire, (the last of them) the last of nations (saith unto the first of them) the first of nations: (Our Lord! These) i.e. the leaders (led us astray) from Your religion and obedience, (so give them double torment of the Fire) torment them with double what you inflict on us. (He says) Allah says to them: (For each one there is double (torment), but ye know not) because of the severity of the torment."
