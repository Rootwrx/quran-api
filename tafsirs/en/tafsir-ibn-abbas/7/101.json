Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they could not believe) in the Scriptures or messengers (because they had before denied) i.e. on the Day of the Covenant; it is also said the last of nations did not believe in that which the first of nations disbelieved. (Thus doth Allah print upon) seal (the hearts of disbelievers) in Allah as it is in the knowledge of Allah."
