(And on the Heights are men) on the wall are men-whose good deeds are of the same amount as their evil deeds; it is also said these are men of knowledge and experts in law but who held doubts about provision (who know them all) all those who enter hell and those who enter Paradise (by their marks) they know those who enter hell by their darkened faces and blue eyes and those who enter Paradise by their lightened faces: at once handsome and radiant. (And they) the people on the wall (call unto the dwellers of the Garden: Peace be unto you) O people of Paradise! (They enter it not) yet (although they hope (to enter)) i.e. the people on the wall."
