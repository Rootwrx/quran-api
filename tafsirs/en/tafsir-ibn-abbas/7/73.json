Serve Allah) profess Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other God save Him) save the One I am commanding you to believe in. (A wonder from your Lord hath come unto you) an exposition from your Lord has come to you. (Lo! this is the camel of Allah, a token unto you) a sign for Allah's message; (so let her feed in Allah's earth) eat its grass unhindered, (and touch her not with hurt) hamstrung her not (lest painful torment seize you) after you hurt her."
