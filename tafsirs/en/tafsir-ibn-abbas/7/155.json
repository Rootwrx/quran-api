If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before) before this day, (and me with them) when I killed the Copt. (Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did) when they worshipped the calf-here Moses thought they were destroyed because of their worship of the calf? (It is but Thy trial (of us)) Your affliction upon us. (Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt) to avoid the sedition. (Thou art our Protecting Friend) You have better right to have mercy on us, (therefore forgive us and have mercy on us) and do not punish us, (Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness) overlook sins."
