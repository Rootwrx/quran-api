((For such) their appointed portion of the Book (of destiny) reacheth them) that which they were promised in the Book such as turning their faces black and their eyes blue. Give them respite, O Muhammad, (till, when Our messengers) i.e. the angel of death and his helpers (come to gather them) to take away their souls, (they say) upon taking away their souls: (Where (now) is that to which ye cried) worshipped (beside Allah) so that they can help you? (They say: They have departed from us) they are too occupied with themselves to pay attention to us. (And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers) in Allah and the messengers in the life of this world."
