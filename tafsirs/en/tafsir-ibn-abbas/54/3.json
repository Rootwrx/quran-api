  "text": "(They denied) the sign and the coming of the Hour (and followed their own lusts) in denying the sign, the coming of the Hour and worshipping idols. (Yet everything will come to a decision) every word from Allah or His Messenger regarding promise, threat, tidings of Paradise or hell, mercy or punishment is true, some of this will happen in the life of the world, for all to see, and some of it will happen in the Hereafter and everything there will be manifest. It is also said that this means: every action and word that ensue from the slaves has a reality and this reality is in the heart."
