(Allah created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them) of created beings and marvels, (save with truth) save for the Truth and the establishment of commands and prohibitions and not merely for falsehood (and for a destined end) and for an appointed time in which there will be requital. (But truly many of mankind) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (are disbelievers in) deny (the meeting with their Lord) resurrection after death."
