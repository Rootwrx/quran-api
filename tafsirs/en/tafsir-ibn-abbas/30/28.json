(Have ye, from among those whom your right hands possess) your slave boys and slave girls, (partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you) on what We gave you of wealth, family and offspring, (equal with you) i.e. your slave boys and slave girls (in respect thereof) in that which We bestowed upon you, (so that ye fear them) you fear their rebuke (as ye fear each other) as you fear the rebuke of your fathers, sons and brothers were you not to fulfil their due rights in inheritance? They said: \" No! \" Allah said: \" Would you then accept for Me that which you do not accept for yourselves: you make My servants My partners but refuse to make your own slaves your partners? \" (Thus We display the revelations) the signs of My divine Oneness and power (for people who have sense) for people who believe in the similitudes of the Qur'an."
