  "text": "(He bringeth forth the living from the dead) He brings forth living beings and animals from a sperm drop and birds from eggs and palm-trees from seeds, (and He bringeth forth the dead from the living) sperm drops from living beings and beasts and brings forth eggs from birds and seeds from palm-trees, (and He reviveth the earth after her death) after drying up and being exposed to drought. (And even so will you be brought forth) in such manner will you be quickened and brought forth from the graves."
