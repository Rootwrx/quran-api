Man) i.e. the disbelieving man: Qurt Ibn 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr; and it is also said it refers to Abu Hubahib (is an ingrate unto his Lord) He says: he is ungrateful for the blessings of his Lord; it is also said this means: He is disobedient of his Lord; and it is also said this means: he is stingy; and it is also said this means: he denies those who are dependent on him, starves his slaves, eats alone and does not give those who are his relatives among his folk."
