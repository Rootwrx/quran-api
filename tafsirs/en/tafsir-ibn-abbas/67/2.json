  "text": "(Who hath created life) resembling a white-and-black female horse which does not pass by, step on, or is smelled by a thing except that that thing becomes alive. This beast is smaller than a mule and bigger than an ass, one gallop can transport it as far as it can see. It is used as a means of travel by the prophets; (and death) resembling a ram whose wool is a mixture of white and black. This ram does not pass by, step on, or is smelled by, any thing except that that thing dies. It is also said that (He created death) means: He created the sperm drop; and (created life) means: He created the living being; (that He may try you) between life and death, (which of you is best in conduct) which of you is more sincere in works; (and He is the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (Forgiving) He forgives those who repent and believe in Him,"
