  "text": "(Those who were left behind) at the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah, i.e. Banu Ghifar, Aslam, Ashja' and some people from Muzaynah and Juhaynah (will say, when ye set forth to capture booty) the booty of Khaybar: (Let us go with you) to Khaybar. (They fain would change the verdict of Allah) when he said to His Prophet not to let them accompany him to any other conquest after failing to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah. (Say) to Banu 'Amir, Dayl, Aslam, Ashja', and a group from Muzaynah and Juhaynah: (Ye shall not go with us) to Khaybar except as volunteers but you will not have a share of the booty. (Thus) just as we told you (hath Allah said beforehand) in surah Repentance (say unto them: Ye shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against a foe\ufffd). Upon hearing this, the hypocrites said to the believers: Allah has not commanded you this, it is rather because you are resentfully envious of us for sharing the booty with you. So Allah said: (Then they will say: Ye are envious of us) regarding the booty. (Nay, but they understand not) the command of Allah, (save a little) neither much nor a little."
