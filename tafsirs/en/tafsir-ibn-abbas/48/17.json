  "text": "Then the people who had infirmities and chronic illnesses came to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah! Allah has threatened to punish whoever stays behind and does not take part in fighting with a painful doom. How can we go out in military expedition when we are physically unable to do so?\ufffd And so Allah said: (There is no blame for the blind) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor is there blame for the lame) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger) openly and privately and answers him by going out to fight the enemy, (He will make him enter Gardens beneath which) beneath whose houses, rooms and trees (rivers) of wine, water, honey, and milk (flow; and whoso turneth back) from the obedience of Allah and His Messenger and refuses to comply, (him will He punish with a painful doom)."
