By Allah, we are just like them, so what do we get?\ufffd Allah said: (And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah) that He will not help His Messenger against the hypocrites. (For them is the evil turn of fortune) and an evil consequence, (and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them) He banished them from all good, (and hath made ready for them) in the Hereafter (hell, a hapless journey's end) what an evil destination they will head for in the Hereafter."
