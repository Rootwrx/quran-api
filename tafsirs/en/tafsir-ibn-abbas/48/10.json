  "text": "Then He mentioned the pact of Ridwan at al-Hudaybiyyah which took place under a tree, the Samurah tree; those present at this pact were about 1500 people, and swore allegiance to the Prophet of Allah which, among others, entailed giving counsel, help and not running away [in war]. Allah said: (Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad)) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah, (swear allegiance only unto Allah) it is as if they swear allegiance to Allah. (The Hand of Allah) in terms of reward and help (is above their hands) in relation to truthfulness, fulfilment and completion. (So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt) the punishment of this breaking is against his soul; (while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah) and remain truthful and loyal, (on him will He bestow immense reward) on him Allah bestows abundant reward in Paradise. None of those who swore allegiance broke his oath, because they were all sincere and died honouring the allegiance of Ridwan. That is to say to the exception of one man named Jadd Ibn Qays, a hypocrite, who hid on that day behind his camel and did not join in when the swearing of allegiance took place. Allah made him die in his state of hypocrisy."
