(Allah's are the hosts of the heavens) the angels (and the earth) the believers and He sets them on whoever He will among His enemies, (and Allah is ever Knower) of what He has done to you: victory, forgiveness, guidance, help and sending down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers, (Wise) regarding that which He has done with you."
