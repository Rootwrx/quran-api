  "text": "(Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth) truly. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) had told his Companions: (Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure) from the enemy, ((having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing) the enemy; and Allah did fulfil what the Prophet (pbuh) had said to his Companions. (But He knoweth that which ye know not) Allah had known that what he promised was not to take place in that year but in the following year, while you did not know this, (and hath given you a near victory beforehand) i.e. the conquest of Khaybar before the fulfilment of this vision."
