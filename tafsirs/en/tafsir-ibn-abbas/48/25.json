(And if it had not been for believing men) al-Walid and Salamah the sons of Hisham, 'Ayyash Ibn Rabi'ah and Abu Jandal Ibn Suhayl Ibn 'Amr (and believing women) in Mecca, (whom ye know not lest ye should tread them under foot) lest you should kill (and thus incur) because of killing (guilt for them) blood money and the sin of killing them; (unknowingly) without knowing that they were believers. if it were not for that, Allah would have set you on them to kill them; (that Allah might bring into His mercy) that Allah may honour with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it. (If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated) if the believers had moved out from among the disbelievers (We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved) the disbelievers of Mecca (with painful punishment) with your swords."
