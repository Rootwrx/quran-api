  "text": "(Those of the wandering Arabs) from Banu Ghifar, Aslam, Ashja', Dayl and some people from Muzaynah and Juhaynah (who were left behind) at the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah (will tell thee: Our possessions and our households occupied us) we were afraid that our households would be ruined if we went out with you, and this is why we stayed behind, (so ask forgiveness for us) O Messenger of Allah, for failing to accompany you to al-Hudaybiyyah! (They speak with their tongues) they ask with their tongue-i.e. forgiveness-(that which is not in their hearts) without really feeling the need for it, whether you ask forgiveness for them or not. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Who can avail you aught against Allah) who can do anything about Allah's torment, (if he intend you hurt) killing and defeat (or intend you profit) victory, booty and well-being? (Nay, but Allah is ever Aware of what ye do) Allah is aware of your failure to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah."
