  "text": "When the true believers heard of the honour that Allah had bestowed upon His Prophet, they said: \ufffdCongratulations, O Messenger of Allah, for what Allah has given you of victory, forgiveness and honour; but what do we have with Allah?\ufffd So Allah said: (That He may bring the believing men) the true believing men (and the believing women) and true believing women (into Gardens beneath which) beneath whose trees, houses and rooms (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will abide) they will abide in the Garden and will never die or leave it, (and may remit from them their evil deeds) which they committed in the life of the world. (That) which I have mentioned which the believers will have, (in the sight of Allah, is the Supreme Triumph) is the greatest safety: they gain Paradise and avoid the Fire and all that which is in it."
