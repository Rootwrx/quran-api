(He hath chosen no son) as claimed by the Jews and Christians (nor hath He any partner in the sovereignty) as claimed by the Arab idolaters. (He hath created everything) that which they worship and that which they do not worship (and hath meted out for it a measure) their lifespan, provision and works are all in a specific measure; it is also said that this means: He decreed for each male a female."
