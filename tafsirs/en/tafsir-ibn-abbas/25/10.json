(Gardens) in the Hereafter (underneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, and will assign you mansions) and He has indeed assigned you in Paradise mansions of gold and silver which are better for you than that which they say; and it is also said that this means: if Allah wills, he will assign to you in this worldly life that which they requested of you: mansions and gardens, i.e. He will make you conquer towers and townships, in the East and the West, in spite of the disbelievers."
