((It is revealed) thus) He says: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments (that We may strengthen thy heart therewith) that We may gladden your heart and preserve your heart; (and We have arranged it in right order) We exposited it by detailing the commands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments verse after verse."
