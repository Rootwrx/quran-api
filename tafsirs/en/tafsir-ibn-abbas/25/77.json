  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to the disbelievers of Mecca: (My Lord would not concern himself with you) what would my Lord do with your bodies and forms (but for your prayer) if He commands you to profess Allah's divine Oneness. (But now ye have denied) you have disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (therefore) this is a threat to them from Allah (there will be judgement) the punishment of the Day of Badr through beating, killing and enslaving them; this is to say: you have disbelieved in your Prophet and, therefore, the chastisement must necessarily befall you'."
