  "text": "(We never sent before you) O Muhammad (any messengers but lo! they ate food) as you do; this is in response to the disbelievers of Mecca who said: (What ails this messenger (of Allah) that he eats food), (and walked in the markets) just as you walk. (And We have appointed some of you a test) a trial (for others) We test the pure Arab with the client, and the noble by birth with the lowly and the rich with the poor; Allah said to Abu Jahl and his host: (Will ye be steadfast) with the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) Salman and his fellow believers, such that you become with them, in relation to Religion and other matters, equal and that you sit together with them? (And thy Lord is ever Seer) that they will not be steadfast regarding this. It is also said that this means: will you be steadfast, O Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) in the face of their harm until I grant you the reward of the steadfast, and your Lord sees who believes among you and who does not?"
