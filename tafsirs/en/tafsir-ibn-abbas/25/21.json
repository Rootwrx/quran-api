(Assuredly they think too highly of themselves) to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to see Allah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for a tremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them."
