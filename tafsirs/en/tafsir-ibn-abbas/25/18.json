(It was not for us) we had no right (to choose) to worship (any protecting friends beside Thee) as lords; it is also said that this means: they said, i.e. the angels, glory be to You! We were not permitted to worship any lords besides You, so how could we have command them to worship us? (but Thou didst give them and their fathers) before them (ease) You gave them a reprieve in their state of disbelief (till they forgot the warning) until they shunned professing Your divine Oneness and refrained from worshipping you (and became lost folk) doomed for destruction and whose hearts became evil."
