(That was Allah's way) thus was Allah's decree (with those who passed away of old) before Muhammad (pbuh); the reference here is to David and his marriage to the wife of Uriya; and it is also said that this refers to the marriage of Solomon with Balqis (and the commandment of Allah is certain destiny) the decree of Allah must necessarily take place."
