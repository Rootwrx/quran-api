Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle)) such as Hamzah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) and his fellow believers who died fighting, (and some of them still are waiting) they will continue to be loyal until they die; (and they have not altered) the covenant (in the least) by breaking it;"
