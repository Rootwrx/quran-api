Keep thy duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah in relation to breaking your pledge before the time of its expiry (and obey not the disbelievers) from among the people Mecca: Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, 'Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl and Abu'l-A'war al-Aslami (and the hypocrites) of Medina: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and Jadd Ibn Qays; do not obey them in what they ask you to commit of transgression. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of what they say and of their intent to kill you, (Wise) He enjoined that one should honour one's pledge and forbade breaking pledges."
