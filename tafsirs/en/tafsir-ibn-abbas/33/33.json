(Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of Ignorance) and do not adorn yourselves with the adornment of the disbelievers in their thin, colourful clothes. (Be regular in prayer) perform the five daily prayers, (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth, (and obey Allah and His messenger) in that which is customary. (Allah's wish) in this (is but to remove uncleanness) sin (far from you, O Folk of the Household) of the Prophet, (and cleanse you) from sins (with a thorough cleansing."
