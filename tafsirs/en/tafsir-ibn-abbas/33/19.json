  "text": "(Being sparing of their help to you (believers)) they claimed they took pity on the believers; it is also said that this means: they are too niggardly when it is a question of spending on the believers. (But when the fear) of the enemy (cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seet them) the hypocrites in the Ditch (regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death) like the one suffering from the pangs of death. (Then, when the fear) of the enemy (departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues) they attack and vilify you (in their greed for wealth (from the spoil)) they are stingy when it comes to spending in the way of Allah. (Such) those who have such traits (have not believed) are not sincere in their faith. (Therefore Allah maketh their deeds fruitless) Allah thwarts their good deeds by means of their evil works. (And that) thwarting good deeds (is easy for Allah)."
