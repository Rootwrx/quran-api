(There is no stand (possible) for you) there is no place for you in the Ditch to fight, (therefore turn back) to Medina. (And certain of them) from the hypocrites among Banu Harithah ((even) sought permission of the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, (saying) allow us, O Prophet of Allah, to go back to Medina: (Our homes lie open (to the enemy)) there are no men in our homes and we fear that thieves may steal from them. (And they lay not open) and they are not without men. (They but wished to flee) from fighting."
