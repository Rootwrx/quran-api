(And the owners of kinship) those related with ties of kinship (are closer one to another) have more right to one another in relation to inheritance (in the ordinance of Allah) thus it is written in the Guarded Tablet; and it is said: thus it is written in the Torah; and it is said: thus it is written in the Qur'an (than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca) except that ye should do kindness) a bequest not exceeding a third of the whole inheritance (to your friends) your custodians in religion or your friends.
