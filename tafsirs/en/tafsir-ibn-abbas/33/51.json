  "text": "(Thou canst defer) you can leave (whom thou wilt of them) from among the daughters of your aunts from your father's side, and or the daughters of your uncles from your mother's side, and not marry them (and receive unto thee whom thou wilt) and marry them, (and whomsoever thou desirest) to marry (of those whom thou hast set aside (temporarily), it is no sin for thee (to receive her again)) it is also said that this could be understood in this manner: you can abstain from whoever you will of your wives and you can go to whoever you will of your wives and there is no sin for you in abstaining from some and going to others; (that) the widening of the scope and dispensation (is better; that they may be comforted) when they know that this widening of scope is from Allah (and not grieve) for fear of divorce, (and may all be pleased with what thou givest them) of sharing your physical presence with them. (Allah knoweth what is in your hearts) whether it is contentment or resentment; (and Allah is Knower) of your righteousness and theirs, (Clement) in that which He explained to you and forgave you."
