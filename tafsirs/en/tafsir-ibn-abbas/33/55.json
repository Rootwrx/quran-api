  "text": "(It is no sin for them) the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) as well as the wives of the believers (with their fathers) that their fathers should enter in on them or converse with them, (or their sons: or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or the sons of their sisters) from the father's side or the mother's side (or of their own women) the women who belong to their own religion; for it is unlawful for a Muslim woman to strip herself of her clothes in front of Jewish, Christian or Magian women, (or their slaves) i.e. women slaves, not male slaves. (O women! Keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah about all these in relation to their entering in on you and their conversation with you. (Lo! Allah is Witness over all things) relating to your works."
