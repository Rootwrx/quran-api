  "text": "Allah then mentioned the attributes of sincere believers, saying: (And when the true believers) the sincere believers (saw the clans) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Sufyan and his host, (they said: This is that which Allah and His messenger promised us) for the counting of days. (Allah and His messenger are true) in their promise, this is because the Prophet (pbuh) had informed them that the Clans will come and remain for nine to ten days, i.e. up to nine or ten days. (It) seeing the disbelievers (did but confirm them in their faith) it increased their certitude in the words of Allah and in the words of His Messenger (and resignation) to the command of Allah and to the command of the Messenger."
