O people of Mecca (If ye are in doubt of my religion) Islam, (then (know that) I worship not those whom ye worship) those upon whom you call, of idols, (instead of Allah, but I worship Allah who causeth you to die) Allah who takes away your souls and brings you back to life after He makes you die, (and I have been commanded to be of the believers) with the believers, following their faith."
