If my sojourn (here)) if my extended stay with you (and my reminding you) and my warning of you (by Allah's revelations) from the punishment of Allah (are an offence unto you, in Allah have I put my trust) I rely in and consign my matter to Allah, (so decide upon your course of action) unite upon one decision and one matter, (you and your partners) and seek the help of your idols. (Let not your course of action be in doubt for you) do not make your decision and matter too vague for yourselves. (Then come forth against me, give me no respite) do not wait."
