(Those who follow) worship (aught instead of Allah follow not) worship not ((His) partners) gods in the form of idols. (They follow) they worship (only a conjecture) by means of conjecture, and have no certainty (and they) i.e. the leaders of the disbelievers (do but guess) they lie to those who are lowly among them."
