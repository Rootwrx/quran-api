So whosoever is guided) by the Scripture and Messenger, (is guided only for (the good of) his soul) i.e. its reward goes to him, (and whosoever erreth) and whoever disbelieves in the Scripture and Messenger (erreth only against it) i.e. the onus of his disbelief goes to him. (And I am not a warder) a trustee (over you). This was abrogated by the verse of fighting."
