  "text": "(He it is who appointed the sun a splendour) for mankind during the daytime (and the moon a light) for them at night, (and measured for her stages) He made it consist of phases, (that ye might know the number of the years, and the reckoning) that you might know the counting of months and days. (Allah created not (all) that save in truth) in order to expound the Truth and the error. (He detaileth the revelations) He details the verses of the Qur'an with signs of divine Oneness (for people who have knowledge) for people who believe."
