  "text": "(Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days) of the days of the life of this world at its beginning. The first day is Sunday and the last is Friday, and each day the equivalent of one thousand years, (then He established Himself upon the Throne) it is also said that this means: the Throne was filled by Him, (directing all things) directing the matters of His servants; it is also said that this means: He looks into the affairs of the servants; and it is also said that this means: He sends the angels with revelations and misfortunes. (There is no intercessor (with Him)) no close angel and no sent prophet will intercede for anyone (save after His permission) save after Allah's leave. (That is Allah, your Lord) it is your Lord Who does thus, (so worship Him) profess His divine Oneness. (Oh, will ye not remind?) will you not take heed?"
