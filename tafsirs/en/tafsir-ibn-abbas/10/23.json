(Your rebellion) your transgression and insolence with one another (is only against yourselves) i.e. its onus is only against you. ((Ye have) enjoyment of the life of the world) the benefits of the life of this world perish and are not lasting; (then unto Us is your return) after death (and We shall proclaim unto you) inform you about (what ye used to do) and say of good and evil."
