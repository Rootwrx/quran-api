  "text": "(The similitude of the life of the world) in terms of its permanence and evanescence (is only as water) rain (which We send down from the sky, then the earth's growth of that which men and cattle eat) grains and fruits for men and plants and abundant grass for cattle (mingles with it till, when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished) with the colours red, yellow and green, (and her people) the plowmen (deem that they are masters of her) of her yielding, (Our commandment) Our punishment (cometh by night or by day) just as if sheep have trampled on its enclosure destroying all the plowmen's plantations (and we make it as reaped corn) in the summer (as if it had not flourished yesterday) as if they had not existed yesterday. (Thus do We expound the revelation) We explain in the Qur'an the evanescence of the life of this world (for people who reflect) upon the matter of this world and the Hereafter."
