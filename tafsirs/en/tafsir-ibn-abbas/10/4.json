He produceth creation) from a sperm drop, (then reproduces it) after death, (that He may reward those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) between themselves and their Lord (with equity) with justice: [i.e. they will earn as a reward] Paradise; (while, as for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom) whose pain will reach to their hearts (because they disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."
