  "text": "(And those who earn ill deeds) those who associate partners with Allah, ((for them) requital of each ill deed by the like thereof) Allah says: the retaliation for associating partners with Allah is hell; (and ignominy overtaketh them) grief and gloominess will appear on their faces. (They have no protector) no one to save them (from Allah) from the punishment of Allah. (As if their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night) i.e. of darkness. (Such are rightful owners of the Fire) the folk of hell; (they will abide therein) for ever."
