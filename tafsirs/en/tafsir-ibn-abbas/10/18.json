Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Would ye inform Allah of (something) that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth) i.e. He knows there does not exist a god who hurts and benefits except Him? (Praised be He) He exalted Himself far above having a son or partner (and high exalted above) and absolves Himself from (all that ye associate (with Him)) of idols!"
