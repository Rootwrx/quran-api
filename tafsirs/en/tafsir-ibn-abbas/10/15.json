(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (It is not for me) it is not permissible for me (to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is inspired in me) I do not say or do except that which is revealed to me in the Qur'an. (Lo! If I disobey my Lord) by changing the revelation (I fear) I know (the retribution of an awful Day) a severe Day."
