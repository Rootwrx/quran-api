(He hath no needs!) He has no need for a son or partners. (His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of created beings and marvels. (Ye have no warrant) you have neither scripture nor proof (for this. Tell ye) indeed, you are saying (concerning Allah that which you know not) of lies?"
