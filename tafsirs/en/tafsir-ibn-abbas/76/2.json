We create man) i.e. the progeny of Adam (from a drop of thickened fluid) from Adam and Eve's drops of two different kinds of fluid: that of man being white and thick and that of the woman being yellow and thin; thus progeny comes from both of them (to test him) with hardship and comfort; it is also said this means: to test him with good and evil; (so We make him hearing, knowing) We gave him the faculty of hearing so that he could hear the Truth and guidance and the faculty of sight so that he could see the Truth and guidance. It is also said that We make him hearing, knowing in order to test him with good and evil, faith and disbelief."
