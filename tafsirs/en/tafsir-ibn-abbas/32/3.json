(Nay, but it) i.e. the Qur'an (is the Truth from thy Lord) Gabriel brought down to you, (that thou mayst warn a folk) i.e. the Quraysh (to whom no warner came before you) no warning messenger came to them before you, O Muhammad, (that haply they may walk aright) that they may be guided from error."
