  "text": "(Is he who is a believer) a sincere believer; the reference here is to 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib (like unto him who is an evil-liver?) I.e. a hypocrite; the reference here is to al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah Ibn Abi Ma'it. (They are not alike) in the life of this world in relation to their obedience nor are they alike in the Hereafter in relation to the reward and honour bestowed by Allah. This is because these two had an argument and exchanged words until 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, said to him: \" O sinner! \"."
