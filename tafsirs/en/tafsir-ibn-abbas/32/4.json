  "text": "(Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them) of creation and marvels, (in six Days) the days of the beginning of creation which equal 1,000 years of the years of the life of this world; the first day being Sunday and the last Friday. (Then He mounted the throne) Allah was on the Throne before He created them. (Ye have not) O people of Mecca, (beside Him, a protecting friend) a relative to help you (or mediator) to intercede for you in order for you to forgo Allah's punishment. (Will ye not then remember) will you then not take admonition through the Qur'an and accept faith?"
