(Lo! those whom ye serve instead of Allah) of idols (own no provision for you) they are unable to provide your sustenance. (So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him) declare His divine Oneness, (and give thanks unto Him) through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, ((for) unto Him ye will be brought back) after death and He will reward each according to his works."
