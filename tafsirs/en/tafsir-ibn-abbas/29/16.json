(Remember)) and We sent Abraham to his people (when he said unto his folk: serve Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness, (and keep your duty unto Him) fear him and obey Him by repenting from disbelief, idolatry and idol worship; (that is better for you) than the state in which you are now (if ye did but know) this and believe in it; but neither do you know this nor believe in it."
