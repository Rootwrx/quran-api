The love) the connection (between you is only in the life of the world) it will not last. (Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other) you absolve yourselves from each other (and curse each other, and your abode) your destination (will be the Fire) i.e. the worshipper and the worshipped, (and ye will have no helpers) to save you from Allah's torment."
