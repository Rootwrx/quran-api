  "text": "(Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture) He says: recite unto them, O Muhammad, that which Gabriel brought down to you, i.e. the Qur'an, (and establish worship) fulfil the five daily prayers. (Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness) transgressions (and iniquity) that which is unknown in the Shari'ah or Sunnah; as long as one performs the prayers, they will prevent one from lewdness and iniquity, (but verily remembrance of Allah is more important) He says: Allah's remembrance of you, through His forgiveness and reward, is greater than your remembrance of Him during the prayer. (And Allah knoweth what ye do) whether it is good or evil."
