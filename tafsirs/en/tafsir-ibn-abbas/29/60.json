And so Allah said: (And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision) for the morrow, except ants who store their yearly provision! (Allah provideth for it) for the animal that stores its provision and the animal that does not (and for you) O believers. (He is the Hearer) when you say: \" who will provide for us? \" , (the Knower) of your sustenance; He knows from whence to provide for you."
