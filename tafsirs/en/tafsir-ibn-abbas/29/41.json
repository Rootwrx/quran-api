  "text": "(The likeness of those who choose) worshipped (other patrons than Allah) idols as Lords (is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all houses is the spider's house) He says: the spider's web does not protect the spider from heat nor from cold; and idols do not protect those who worship them in this worldly life nor in the Hereafter, (if they but knew) this similitude; but they do not know nor believe in it."
