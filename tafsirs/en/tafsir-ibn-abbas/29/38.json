((Their fate) is manifest unto you) O people of Mecca (from their (ruined and deserted) dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them) in their state of idolatry, hardship and comfort (and so debarred them from the Way) the Truth and guidance, (though they were keen observers) they thought they followed the Truth when they did not."
