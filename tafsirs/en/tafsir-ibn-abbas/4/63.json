  "text": "(Those are they) i.e. him who did turn away from the Prophet (pbuh) (the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth) He knows the hypocrisy in the heart of Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah. Another interpretation of the above verse is: How shall they do-those who established a counter mosque-when a punishment strikes them, because of the counter mosque they built, and then afterward came to you-Tha'labah and Hatib-swearing by Allah that they did not intend by the building of the mosque except kindness to the believers and religious harmony, so that you send us a man of knowledge to teach us? Allah knows the hypocrisy and antagonism in the hearts of those who built this counter mosque. (So oppose them) leave them and do not punish them this time (and admonish them) with your words so that they do not do it again, (and address them in plain terms about their souls) threaten them in an unequivocal way that you will punish them if they do it again."
