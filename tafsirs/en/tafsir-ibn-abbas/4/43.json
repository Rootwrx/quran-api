  "text": "Allah revealed the following about the Companions of Muhammad prior to the prohibition of intoxicants: (O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (Draw not near unto prayer) in the Mosque of the Prophet (pbuh) with the Prophet (pbuh) (when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter) so that you know what the prayer leader recites during the prayer, (nor when ye are polluted) nor when you are in a state of major ritual impurity, (save when journeying upon the road) except when passing through when you have to, (till ye have bathed) to purify yourselves from major ritual impurity. (And if ye be ill) wounded, (or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women) made love to them, (and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces) with the first clap (and your hands (therewith)) with the second clap. (Lo! Allah is Benign) Allah is Generous for the abundance He has given you, (Forgiving) of any shortcoming that may ensue from you."
