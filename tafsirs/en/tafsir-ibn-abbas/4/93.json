  "text": "Then Allah revealed about Miqyas Ibn Sababah, the killer of al-Fihri, the emissary of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) who, after taking the blood money for the killing of his brother Hisham Ibn Sababah, left Islam and fled to Mecca, saying: (Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell) for this wilful killing (for ever) due to his idolatry. (Allah is wroth against him) for taking the blood money (and He hath cursed him) because he killed a person who did not kill his brother (and prepared for him an awful doom) because of his boldness towards Allah."
