(And We charged those who received the Scripture before you) i.e. the people of the Torah We charged them in the Torah, and the people of the Gospel in the Gospel, and the people of every Scripture in their Scripture, (and (We charge) you) O Community of Muhammad in your Book, (that you keep your duty towards Allah) obey Allah. (And if you disbelieve) in Allah, (lo! Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens) of angels as soldiers (and whatsoever is in the earth) of humans, jinn and other creatures as soldiers, (and Allah is ever Absolute) free from the need of your faith, (Owner of Praise) for His actions, He is grateful for whatever little is done for His sake and rewards abundantly for it."
