(Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you) i.e. the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir (so that assuredly they would have fought you) together with their people upon the conquest of Mecca. (So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you) upon the conquest of Mecca (and offer you peace) they submit to you through peace and honouring the pact they made, (Allah alloweth you no way against them) He does not give you any excuse for killing them."
