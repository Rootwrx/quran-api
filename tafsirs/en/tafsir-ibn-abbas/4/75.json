O our Lord! (Bring us forth from out this town) i.e. Mecca (of which the people are oppressors!) whose people are idolaters (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some protecting friend!) a protector, meaning: 'Itab Ibn Usayd. (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some defender!) who would prevent us from suffering. Allah answered their prayers and made the Prophet (pbuh) their defender and 'Itab their protecting friend."
