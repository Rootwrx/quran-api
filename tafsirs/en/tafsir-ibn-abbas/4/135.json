  "text": "(O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for Allah, even though it be against yourselves or (your) parents or (your) kindred, whether (the case be of) rich or poor) parents, (for Allah is nearer unto both (than ye are)) Allah has better right to protect them than you do. (So follow not passion lest ye lapse) lest you are not just in testimony (and if you lapse) if you stammer (or fall away) or do not testify in front of judges, (then lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do) whether you testify or withhold your testimony. This verse was revealed regarding Miqyas Ibn Sababah who had something to testify against his father."
