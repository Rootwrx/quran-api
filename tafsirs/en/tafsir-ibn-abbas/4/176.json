  "text": "(They ask thee for a pronouncement) O Muhammad. This verse was revealed about Jabir Ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari who asked the Prophet (pbuh): I have a sister. What do I inherit from her if she dies? So Allah said: they ask you, O Muhammad, about the inheritance of al-Kalalah (Say: Allah hath pronounced for you) Allah clarifies for you (concerning distant kindred) concerning the inheritance of al-Kalalah which is anyone other than the father and the son. He said: (If a man dies childless) and his father is also deceased (and he has a sister) a full sister, or half sister from his father's side, (hers is half the heritage) left by the deceased person, (and he would have inherited from her had she died childless) without sons or daughters. (And if there be two sisters) full sisters or half sisters from the father's side, (then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage) that the deceased person has left behind, (and if they be brethren, men and women) male or female, full siblings or half siblings from the father, (unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. Allah expoundeth unto you) the division of estates, (so that ye err not) in the division of estates. (Allah is Knower of all things) of the divisions of estates and other things'."
