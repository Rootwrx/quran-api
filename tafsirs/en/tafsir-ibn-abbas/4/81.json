Command us with whatever you will and we shall comply; (but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them) of the hypocrites (spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest) what you command. (Allah recordeth what they plan by night) He records their planning to change your command. (So oppose them) but do not punish them (and put thy trust in Allah) rely on Allah regarding that which they are good for. (Allah is sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to give you triumph and sovereignty over them."
