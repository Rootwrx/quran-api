If they had said: \ufffdWe hear) your saying, O Muhammad (and we obey) your command; (hear you) hear from us, (and look at us\ufffd it had been better for them) than their insults and defamation, (and more upright) and more correct. (But Allah hath cursed them) punishes them by making them pay the capitation tax (for their disbelief) as a punishment for their disbelief, (so they believe not, save a few) among them who have accepted Islam such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his friends."
