  "text": "(The People of the Scripture) Ka'b and his followers (ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an (actual) Book to descend upon them from heaven) in one bulk just as the Torah was sent down; it is also said that this means: they ask you to bring down for them a book that contains all that is good for them and all that is bad for them, their rewards and punishments. (They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime) greater than what they have asked you, (for they said: Show us Allah plainly) such that they could see Him with their own eyes. (The storm of lightning seized them) the Fire burnt them (for their wickedness) for their rejection of Moses and their boldness vis-\ufffd-vis Allah. (Then (even after that) they chose the calf) they worshipped the calf (after clear proofs) commands and prohibitions (had come unto them. And We forgave them that!) We left them and did not exterminate them. (And We bestowed on Moses evident authority) evident proof: the staff and the white hand."
