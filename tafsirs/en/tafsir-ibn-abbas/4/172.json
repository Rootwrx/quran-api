  "text": "(The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah) he will never not acknowledge his servitude to Allah. This was revealed in respect of the Christians saying to the Prophet: \ufffdO Muhammad, what you say of Jesus is shameful\ufffd. Allah said to them: it is not shameful that Jesus be the servant of Allah, (nor will the favoured angels) nor would the favoured angels, the carriers of the Throne, ever not acknowledge that they are servants of Allah. (Whoso scorneth His service) whoever scorns to acknowledge that being his servant (and is proud) is too proud to believe in Allah, (all such) believers and unbelievers (will He assemble unto Him) on the Day of Judgement."
