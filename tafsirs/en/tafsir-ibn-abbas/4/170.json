  "text": "(O mankind!) O people of Mecca (The messenger) Muhammad (hath come unto you with the Truth) with the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness and the Qur'an (from your Lord. Therefore believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an; ((it is) better for you) than that which you are in now. (But if ye disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (still, lo! Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth) they are all His bondsmen and bondswomen. (Allah is ever Knower) of those who believe and those who do not, (Wise) in that He ordained that they should not worship other than Him."
