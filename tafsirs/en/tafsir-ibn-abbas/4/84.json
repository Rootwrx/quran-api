(Thou are not taxed) you are not commanded this (except for thyself and urge on the believers) to advance with you. (Peradventure Allah) peradventure when it is used in relation to Allah means that Allah will take it upon Himself (will restrain) will stop (the might) the fighting (of those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca. (Allah is stronger in might) in His torment (and stronger in inflicting punishment)."
