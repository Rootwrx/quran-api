  "text": "(And serve Allah) acknowledge His divine Oneness. (Ascribe no thing) no idol (as partner unto Him. (Show) kindness unto parents) be dutiful to parents, (and unto near kindred) Allah commands you to keep ties with your kin, (and orphans) He commands that you show kindness to orphans, and to protect their wealth, etc, (and the needy) and He enjoins giving alms to the needy, (and unto the neighbour who is of kin (unto you)) the neighbour who also happen to be your relative has three rights over you: the right of kinship, the right of Islam, and the right of being a neighbour (and the neighbour who is not of kin) the neighbour who is not a relative has two rights: the right of Islam and the right of being a neighbour (and the fellow traveller) a fellow traveller has two rights: the right of Islam and the right of companionship; it is also said that this refers to one's wife at home. Allah commands kindness towards her (and the wayfarer) Allah commands the honouring of guests. Honouring a guest for three days is the guest's right. The honour bestowed on the guest after the third day is considered a charity on the part of the host; (and (the slaves) whom your right hands possess) Allah commands kindness towards slaves, males and females. (Lo! Allah loveth not such as are proud) in their walking (and boastful) about the bounties of Allah, showing nothing but wantonness and arrogance towards Allah's servants,"
