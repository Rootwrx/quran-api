We reveal unto thee the Scripture) We have sent you Gabriel with the Qur'an (with the Truth) to show what is true and what is false, (that thou mayst judge between mankind) justly: between Tu'mah and Zayd Ibn Samin (by that which Allah showeth thee) by that which Allah hath taught and shown you in the Qur'an. (And be not thou a pleader) a helper (for the treacherous) through their theft, i.e. Tu'mah;"
