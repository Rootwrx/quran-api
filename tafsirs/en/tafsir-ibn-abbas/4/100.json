  "text": "(Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah (will find much refuge) and a sanctuary (and abundance) of means of living and safety (in the earth) in Medina. This was revealed about Aktham Ibn Sayfi and again about Jundu' Ibn Damura, an old man who lived in Mecca and who migrated from the latter to Medina but died in al-Tan'im. His reward is the same as the reward of those who made it to Mecca, and so he died with his endeavour highly praised. Allah said in this context: (and whoso forsaketh his home) in Mecca, (a fugitive unto Allah) unto the obedience of Allah (and His messenger) and unto His Messenger in Medina, (and death overtaketh him) at al-Tan'im, (his reward) the reward of his migration (is then incumbent on Allah. Allah is ever Forgiving) of his past idolatry, (Merciful) regarding that which ensued from him in Islam."
