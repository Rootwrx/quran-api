Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant) He will not leave of the works of the unbeliever even the weight of an ant to benefit him in the Hereafter or to restore the wrongs committed against his antagonists; (and if there is a good deed) for the sincere believer after restoring the wrongs committed against his antagonists, (He will double it) from one to ten times (and will give (the doer) from His presence an immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
