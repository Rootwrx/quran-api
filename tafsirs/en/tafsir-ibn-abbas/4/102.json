  "text": "Allah said: (And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them) present with them (and arranges (their) worship for them) and stand to lead the prayer for them, begin by saying Allah is the greatest (Allahu akbar) and let them repeat the same after you, (let only a party of them stand with thee) in prayer (and let them take their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations) when they have prayed one unit (let them fall) let them retreat (to the rear) to the position of their fellow believers who are facing the enemy (and let another party) who were facing the enemy (come that hath not worshipped) that has not performed the first unit of prayer with you (and let them worship with thee) let them pray with you the second unit of prayer, (and let them take their precaution) against the enemy (and their arms) let them take their arms with them. (Those who disbelieve) i.e. the Banu Anmar (long for you to neglect your arms) and be oblivious to them (and your baggage) and they also long that you forget the means of war (that they may attack you once for all) while you are performing the prayers. Then Allah gave the believers a legal dispensation to put down their arms, saying: (It is no sin for you) there is no harm for you (to lay aside your arms, if rain) intense rain (impedeth you or ye are sick) wounded. (But take your precaution) against your enemy. (Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers) the Banu Anmar (shameful punishment) by means of which they will be humiliated; it is also said that this means: a severe punishment."
