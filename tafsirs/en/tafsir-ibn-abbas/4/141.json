Give us then of the booty, (and if the disbelievers) the Jews (meet with a success) fortune turn in their favour (say: Had we not the mastery of you) did we not divulge, and inform you about, the secrets of Muhammad, (and did we not protect you from the believers?) and did we not protect you from fighting the believers and informed you about them (Allah will judge between you) O congregation of Jews and hypocrites (at the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will not give the disbelievers) the Jews (any way (of success) against the believers) He will not always let fortune turn in favour of the Jews to the detriment of the believers."
