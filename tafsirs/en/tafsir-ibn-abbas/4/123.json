(He who doeth wrong) evil (will have the recompense thereof) the believers will be recompensed in this world or after death before entering Paradise, and the unbelievers in the Hereafter before entering hell, (and will not find against Allah) against the torment of Allah (any protecting friend) any relative to benefit him (or helper) to save him from the torment."
