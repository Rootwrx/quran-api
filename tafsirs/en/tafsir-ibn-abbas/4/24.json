  "text": "(And all married women (are forbidden unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess) of captives, even if they have husbands in the Abode of War, after ascertaining that they are not pregnant, by waiting for the lapse of one period of menstruation. (It is a decree of Allah for you) that which I have mentioned to you is unlawful in Allah's Book. (Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned) as unlawful, (so that ye seek them) marry (with your wealth) up to four wives; it is also said that this means: so that you buy with your wealth captives; and it is also said that this means: so that you should seek with your money marrying women for an agreed period of time (zawaj al-mut'ah) but the lawfulness of this practice was later abrogated, (in honest wedlock) He says: be with them as legitimate husbands, (not debauchery) not indulging in adultery without having a proper marriage. (And those of whom) after marriage (ye seek content) from whom you derive benefit, (give unto them their portions) give to them their full dowry (as a duty) as an obligation upon you from Allah to give the dowry in full. (And there is no sin for you) there is no harm for you (in what ye do by mutual agreement) in increasing or decreasing the amount of the dowry by mutual agreement (after the duty hath been done) after the first obligation to which you have aspired. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) in relation to making lawful to you marriage for an agreed, limited period of time, (Wise) in later making this practice unlawful; it is also said that this means: Allah is ever Knower of your compulsion for marriage for an agreed, limited period of time, Wise in making such marriage unlawful."
