O our Lord! (Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us?) why have You obligated on us jihad in Your way? (If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while!) if only You would keep us safe for a short while before death. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The comfort of this world) the benefit of this world (is scant) in the Hereafter; (the Hereafter) the reward of the Hereafter (will be better for him who wardeth off (evil)) who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies; (and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date stone) their good deeds will not be diminished even if it be as much as the down on a date stone."
