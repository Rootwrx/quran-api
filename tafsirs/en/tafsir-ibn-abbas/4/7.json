  "text": "Allah then mentioned the share of men and women in inheritance-because they were not in the habit of giving any inheritance to women and children-saying: (Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it is a little or much) whether the inheritance is much or little (a legal share) a determined share whether it is much or little, but He did not specify these shares. Allah did expound consequently on the exact value of these shares. This verse was revealed about Umm Kuhhah and her daughters who had an uncle who did not give them anything from their inheritance."
