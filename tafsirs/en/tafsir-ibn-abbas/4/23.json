(And (it is forbidden unto you) that ye should have two sisters together) whether they are free or slave sisters, (except what hath already happened (of that nature) in the past) before Islam. (Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving) of that which ensued from you in the pre-Islamic era, (Merciful) regarding that which ensues from you in Islam, provided that you repent."
