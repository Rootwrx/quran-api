  "text": "(They consult thee concerning women) they ask you about the inheritance of women; the one who asked him was 'Uyaynah. (Say: Allah giveth to you decree) expounds to you the legal ruling (concerning them) concerning their inheritance, (and the Scripture) at the beginning of this surah (which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree), concerning female orphans) the daughters of Umm Kuhhah (unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them) that which is prescribed for them of inheritance; Allah has already explained this at the beginning of the surah (though you desire to marry them) you refrain from marrying them because they are not attractive, so now give them their wealth so that you may desire to marry them for that which they have, (and (concerning) the weak among children) and He expounds to you the inheritance of children, (and that ye should deal justly with orphans) He explains to you that you should protect justly and fairly the wealth of orphans. (Whatever good ye do) by being kind to them, (lo! Allah is ever Aware of it) as well as of your intentions."
