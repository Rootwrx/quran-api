  "text": "Allah then explained the reward of those who fight in the way of Allah, saying: (Those of the believers who sit still) although they do not suffer from any disabling hurt, and do not participate in jihad, (other than those who have a (disabling) hurt) if they were to participate in jihad, i.e. either they are weak in their bodies or have lost their sight, as with 'Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum and 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh al-Asdi, (are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth) by spending their money (and lives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank) a merit (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt. (Unto each) those who engage in jihad and those who do not (Allah hath promised good) Paradise due to their faith, (but He hath bestowed on those who strive) those who engage in jihad in his way (a great reward) an abundant reward in Paradise (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt;"
