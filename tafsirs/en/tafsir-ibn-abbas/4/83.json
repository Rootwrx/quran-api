  "text": "Allah then mentioned the betrayal of the hypocrites, saying: (And if any tidings whether of safety) any news about the army, conquest or booty, they insist on it out of resentful envy (or fear) and when they receive any news about the army, killings or defeat, (come unto them, they noise it abroad) they divulge it, (whereas if they had referred it) the news of the army (to the messenger) until the messenger informs them (and such of them as are in authority) those possessed of reason and understanding, i.e. Abu Bakr and his companions, (those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it) i.e. the precise news. (If it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy) by means of His given success and protection (you would have followed Satan) all of you, (save a few (of you)) who would not divulge the news."
