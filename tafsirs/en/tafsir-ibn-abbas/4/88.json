  "text": "The following was revealed about ten hypocrites who left Islam and Medina for Mecca: (What aileth you) O group of believers (that you are become two parties) one party of the view that the hypocrites' wealth and blood are lawful and a party holding the opposite view (regarding the hypocrites) who abandoned Islam, (when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned) because of their hypocrisy and evil intentions? (Seek you to guide) to the religion of Allah (him whom Allah hath sent astray) from His religion? (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him thou (O Muhammad) canst not find a road) you cannot find a religion or argument in their favour."
