(Lo! in that case (if ye stayed)) i.e. if you sit with them without being coerced to do so (ye would be like unto them) in engaging in the same conversation and in showing derision. (Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites) the hypocrites of Medina: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers (and disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Jahl and his followers, and the disbelievers of Medina: Ka'b and his followers, (all together, into hell);"
