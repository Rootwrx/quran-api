  "text": "(And give unto the women, (whom ye marry) free gift) as an obligation from Allah upon you (of their marriage portions) their dowries; (but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof) if they make lawful for you to take some of the dowry, (then ye are welcome to absorb it (in your wealth)) there is no blame or sin on you if you do so. Before Islam, men used to marry without giving any dowry to their wives."
