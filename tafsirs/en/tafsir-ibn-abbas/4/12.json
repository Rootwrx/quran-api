  "text": "(And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave) of property, (if they have no child) male or female, from you or from other than you; (but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave) of property, (after any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt) after paying back any debt that they may have contracted and extracting any bequest she may have bequeathed. (And unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye leave) of property (if ye have no child) male or female from them or from other than them, (but if ye have a child) male or female, from them or from other than them (then the eighth of that which ye leave) of property, (after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, or debt (ye may have contracted, hath been paid)) after paying back any debt you may have contracted and extracting any bequest you may have bequeathed to someone. (And if a man) who does not have parents, children or kinsfolk related to his parents or children (or a woman) who is in the same situation (have a distant heir (having left neither parent nor child)) brothers or sisters from the mother side. It is also said that this refers to any kin other than parents and children, (and he (or she)) the deceased (have a brother or a sister) only on the mother's side (then to each of them twain (the brother and the sister) the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be sharers in the third) the male and the female having equal share, (after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt (contracted)) after paying back any debt that the deceased may have contracted and after extracting any bequest that he may have bequeathed provided it does not exceed a third of the inheritance (not injuring) the heirs by willing away more than a third of the inheritance (hath been paid. A commandment from Allah) it is an obligation upon you from Allah that you must divide inheritance. (Allah is Knower) regarding the division of inheritance, (Indulgent) in relation to that which happens between you of ignorance and deception regarding the division of inheritance, despite of which He does not hasten His punishment upon you."
