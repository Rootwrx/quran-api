  "text": "(And unto each) He says: to each one of you (We have appointed heirs) so that they inherit (of that which parents and near kindred leave) of property; (and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant) your stipulation, (give them their due) give them their stipulation. But this is now abrogated. In the pre-Islamic era, they used to adopt men and youth and allocate for them a portion of their wealth, just as they would do with their own children. Allah abrogated such a practice. However, it is not abrogated if he gives them their portion from a third of his wealth. (Lo! Allah is ever witness over) Allah knows (all things) relating to your works."
