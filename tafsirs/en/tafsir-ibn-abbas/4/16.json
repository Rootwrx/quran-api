  "text": "(And as for the two of you) of your free people, i.e. any unmarried man or woman (who are guilty thereof) who are guilty of adultery, (punish them both) by maligning and upbraiding them. (And if they repent) after this (and improve) in relation to that which is between them and Allah, (then let them be) refrain from maligning and upbraiding them. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) He overlooks sins, (Merciful). Maligning and upbraiding the unmarried person who commits adultery was later abrogated and replaced by one hundred lashes for both parties."
