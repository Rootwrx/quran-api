Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits) to give back the key (to their owners) to 'Uthman Ibn Talhah, (and, if ye judge between mankind) between 'Uthman Ibn Talhah and 'Abbas Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, (that you judge justly) that you give back to 'Uthman and the providing of water (siqaya) to al-'Abbas. (Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you) comely is this which Allah commands you, of giving back deposits to their owners and judging justly. (Lo! Allah is ever Hearer) when al-'Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah! give me both the key and the providing of water, (Seer) of what 'Uthman Ibn Talhah did when he refused to give the key and said: By Allah's trust! Give me my right, O Messenger of Allah!"
