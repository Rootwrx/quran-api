Whenever I call unto them) to repentance and belief in Allah's divine Oneness (that Thou mayst pardon them) through their repentance and faith in Allah's divine Oneness (they thrust their fingers in their ears) so as not to hear my words and invitation (and cover themselves with their garments) and cover their heads with their garments so that they do not hear my voice or see me (and persist (in their refusal)) and they remain firm in their disbelief and worship of idols; it is also said that they all shouted in unison: \ufffdO Noah! We will not believe in you\ufffd, (and magnify themselves in pride) and feel too proud to accept faith or repent, because of their arrogance."
