(They will spend it) on the life of this world, (then it will become an anguish for them) a regret for them in the Hereafter, (then they will be conquered) they will be defeated and killed on the Day of Badr. (And those who disbelieve) Abu Jahl and his host (will be gathered unto hell) in the Hereafter,"
