(Allah knoweth them) Allah knows their number. (Whatsoever) of wealth (you spend in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, whether it is arms or horses (it will be repaid to you in full) its reward will be repaid to you, none of it will be diminished, (and ye will not be wronged) your reward will not be diminished."
