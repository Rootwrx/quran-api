(If there be of you twenty steadfast) in war, seeking their reward only from Allah (they shall overcome two hundred) of the idolaters, (and if there be of you a hundred steadfast they shall overcome) shall fight (a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers) are a folk without intelligence) they do not understand the command of Allah and His divine Oneness."
