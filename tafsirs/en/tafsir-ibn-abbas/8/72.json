(And those who believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (but did not leave their homes) in Mecca to migrate to Medina, (ye have no duty to protect them) you do not inherit them, nor do they inherit you (till they leave their homes) and migrate to Medina; (but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion) if they seek your help against their enemies in religion (then it is your duty to help (them)) against their enemies (except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty) in which case you should not help them, but rather try to make peace between them. (Allah is Seer of what ye do) regarding peace and other things."
