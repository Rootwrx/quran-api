(And thou (Muhammad) threwest not when thou didst throw) you did make the dust reach the faces of the idolaters, (but Allah threw) did make it so reach, (that He might test the believers) through the throwing of dust (by a fair test from Him) by giving them victory and spoils of war. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your supplications, (Knower) of your help."
