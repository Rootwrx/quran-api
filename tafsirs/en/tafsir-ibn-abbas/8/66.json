(So if there be of you a steadfast hundred) who seek their reward only from Allah (they shall overcome) they shall fight (two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand (steadfast) they shall overcome) they shall fight (two thousand by permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast) He helps the steadfast in war by making them triumphant."
