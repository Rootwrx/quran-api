(But when the armies came in sight of one another) the army of the believers and the army of the disbelievers and Iblis saw Gabriel with the angels (he took flight) he retreated, (saying) to the disbelievers: (Lo! I am guiltless of you) and of your fighting. (Lo! I see that which ye see not) I see Gabriel while you do not see him. (Lo! I fear Allah. And Allah is severe in punishment) when He punishes; Iblis was scared of being captured by Gabriel and of being shown to the disbelievers, for then they would never obey him."
