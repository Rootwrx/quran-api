If you keep your duty to Allah) regarding that which He has commanded you and warned you against, (He will give you discrimination) victory and salvation (and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds) but not the enormities which you have committed, (and will forgive you) all the other transgressions. (Allah is of Infinite Bounty) He favours His servants with forgiveness and Paradise."
