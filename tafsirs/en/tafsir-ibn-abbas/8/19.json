  "text": "(If ye sought a judgement) if you sought help, (now hath the judgement come unto you) the victory of Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions against you, since Abu Jahl had prayed before the fighting started, saying: \" O Allah, assist the best, the most honoured and more beloved religion to you \" , and so Allah answered his prayer and gave victory to Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions against them. (And if ye cease) from disbelief and fighting (it will be better for you) than disbelief and fighting, (but if ye return) to fighting Muhammad (pbuh) (We also shall return) to your killing and defeat as on the Day of Badr. (And your host) your group (will avail you naught) vis-\ufffd-vis Allah's punishment, (however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers) He assists them by giving them victory."
