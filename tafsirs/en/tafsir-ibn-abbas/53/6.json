  "text": "(One vigorous) one strong; it is also said this means: one mighty, for his strength was such that he put his hand under the townships of Lot and pulled them out, raised them to the sky and threw them upside down to the ground. His strength was also such that he seized the sides of the gate of Antioch and cried one cry that killed all the living creatures in it. It is also said that his strength was such that he spread one of his feathers on a hill in Jerusalem and struck with it Iblis who was at the farthest corner of India; (and he grew clear to view) Gabriel appeared in the form in which Allah created it him; and it is also said: he appeared in a beautiful form."
