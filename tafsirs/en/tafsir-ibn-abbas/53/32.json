  "text": "Allah then showed their works in the life of the world, saying: (Those who avoid enormities of sin) i.e. idolatry and the major sins (and abominations) adultery and transgressions, (save the unwilled offences) except a furtive look, a taunt, a censure which they then blame themselves for committing and repent of doing; it is also said that this means: except marrying ((for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy) towards he who repents of major and minor sins. (He is best aware of you) than your own selves (when He created you from the earth) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust and dust is from the earth, (and when ye were) small (hidden in the bellies of your mothers) Allah knew in these circumstances what will ensue from you. (Therefore ascribe not purity unto yourselves) do not absolve yourselves from committing sins. (He is best aware of him who wardeth off (evil)) transgression and does good."
