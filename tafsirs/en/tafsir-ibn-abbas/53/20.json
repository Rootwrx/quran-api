It is also said that the verse means: do you deem that your worship of al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat in the life of the world will benefit you in the Hereafter. No, it will surely not benefit you. As for al-Lat it was an idol which was worshipped in Thaqif; al-'Uzza was a tree in Batn al-Nakhlah which Ghatafan worshipped; while Manat was an idol in Mecca which was worshipped beside Allah by Hudhayl and Khuza'ah."
