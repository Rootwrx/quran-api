  "text": "(And (remember)) O Muhammad (when Moses said unto his people) to his hypocritical people: (O my people! Why persecute ye me) why do you hurt me with the things you say about me. They used to accuse him of having swollen testicles, and his story has already been explained in Surah of the Clans, (when ye well know that I am Allah's messenger unto you? So when they went astray) when they deviated from the Truth and guidance (Allah sent their hearts astray) from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that this means: when they lied about Moses, Allah turned away their hearts from the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness; and it is also said that this means: when they deviated from the Truth and guidance, Allah increased the deviance of their hearts. (And Allah guideth not) to His religion (the evil-living folk) the disbelievers, those whom Allah knows in His preeternal knowledge that they will not believe."
