  "text": "(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Be Allah's helpers) be helpers to Muhammad (pbuh) against his enemies; it is also said this means: be Allah's helpers against His enemies, (even as Jesus son of Mary said unto the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah) who are my helpers, along with Allah, against His enemies? (They said) his disciples said: (We are Allah's helpers) we are your helpers, along with Allah, against His enemies. They were 12 male disciples, the first to believe in him and help him against his enemies. All of these men were believers. (And a party of the Children of Israel believed) in Jesus the son of Mary, (while a party disbelieved) in Jesus son of Mary. This is the party that was led astray by Paul and did not believe in him. (Then We strengthened) We helped and fortified (those who believed) in Jesus the son of Mary and did not oppose his religion (against their foe) those who opposed the religion of Jesus, (and they became the uppermost) in argument against their foes because of their prayer to Allah, and it is also said because they were among those who glorified Allah'."
