  "text": "(They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had our fathers nor had we forbidden aught) of crops and cattle, but this has been commanded and forbidden for us. (Thus) just as did your people give the lie (did those who were before them give the lie) to their messengers (till they tasted of the fear of Us) Our torment. (Say) O Muhammad: (Have ye any knowledge) any clarification regarding what you describe as unlawful (that ye can adduce for us? Lo! ye follow naught but an opinion) your prohibition of crops and cattle is nothing but surmise. (Lo! Ye do but guess) you just lie."
