  "text": "(They are losers who besottedly) out of ignorance (have slain their children) have buried their daughters alive (without knowledge) this was revealed about Rabi'ah and Mudar, two leaders of Arab clans buried their daughters alive in the pre-Islamic period, except for the the Banu Kinanah who did not engage in such a practice, (and have forbidden) for women (that which Allah bestowed upon them) that which Allah has made lawful for them of cattle and crops, (inventing a lie against Allah. They indeed have gone astray) they are in error about what they say (and are not guided) to the guidance and right in that which they ascribe unlawfulness."
