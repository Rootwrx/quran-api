(Say) O Muhammad to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (I will not follow your desires) by worshipping idols and repelling Salman and his fellow believers from me, (for then) for if I do that (should I go astray) from guidance (and I should not be of the rightly guided) to that which is right if I were to do so."
