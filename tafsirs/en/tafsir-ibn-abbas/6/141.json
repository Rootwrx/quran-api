(Eat you of the fruit thereof) of the fruit of the palm-tree (when it fruits) when it ripens, (and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day) it could also mean upon measuring it, (and be not prodigal) do not spend in disobedience of Allah nor prevent the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: do not forbid the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah and the Ham. (Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals) those who spend in disobedience of Allah; or it could mean: the idolaters. It is said that this verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays who collected with his own hands the harvest of 500 palm-trees and gave it away, not leaving a thing for his own family."
