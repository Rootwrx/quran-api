They threatened him with their gods, saying: we fear that if you vilify our gods, they will take away your sanity. (Which of the two factions) which of the adherents of the two religions: you or I (hath more right to safety) from the God Whom he worships? ((Answer me that) if ye have knowledge) of this."
