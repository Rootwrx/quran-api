  "text": "(Then are they restored unto Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (their Lord, the Just) Who is in charge of their right and just reward and punishment; it is also said (their Lord, the Just) means: their true God whom they ought to have worshipped, but they did not worship Him truly as He ought to have been worshipped. However, objects of worship other than Allah are void. (Surely His is the judgement) between people on the Day of Judgement. (And He is the most swift of reckoners) when He takes people to task, He does so swiftly."
