  "text": "Malik Ibn 'Awf understood what was required of him and kept silent. Instead, he said: \ufffdLet me hear from you, O Muhammad, why our forefathers forbade them\ufffd. So Allah said: (Say) O Muhammad: (I find not in that which is revealed unto me) i.e. the Qur'an (aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul) unlawful (or the abomination) an immolated animal (which was immolated to the name of other than Allah) intentionally. (But whoso is compelled (thereto)) whoever is forced to eat the meat of carrion, (neither craving) i.e. without infringement on Muslims nor deeming the meat of carrion lawful in other than necessity (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery or intentionally eating of the meat of carrion without being compelled to do so, ((for him) lo! your Lord is Forgiving) if he eats to satiety, (Merciful) in that which He made dispensation for him. However, he ought not to eat to satiety, and if he does, Allah will pardon him."
