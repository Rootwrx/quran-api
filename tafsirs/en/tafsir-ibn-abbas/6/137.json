  "text": "(Thus) just as We have made their words and works seem fair to them (have their (so called) partners) among the devil (made the killing of their children) their daughters (to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them) destroy them (and make their faith) the religion of Abraham and Ishmael (obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so) i.e. killing their daughters and making it seem fair to them. (So leave them alone with their devices) with their lies when they claim that Allah commanded them to bury their daughters alive."
