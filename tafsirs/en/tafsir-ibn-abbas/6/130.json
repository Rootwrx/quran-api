Came there not unto you messengers of your own) i.e. human messengers: Muhammad (pbuh) and all other messengers, and among the jinn, the nine who came to the Prophet (pbuh) and then went back to their people to deliver the message; it is also said that the jinn had a prophet of their own called Joseph, (who recounted) recited (unto you My tokens) detailing commands and prohibitions (and warned you of the meeting) the punishment (of this your Day? They) the humans and jinn (will say: We testify against ourselves) that they delivered the message and that we disbelieved them. Allah said: (And the life of the world) that which is in the life of this world of comfort and enjoyment (beguiled them. And they testify against themselves) in the Hereafter (that they were disbelievers) in the life of this world."
