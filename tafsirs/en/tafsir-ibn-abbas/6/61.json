He sendeth guardians) angels: two angels during the day and two at night; they record your good and bad deeds (over you until, when death cometh unto one of you, Our messengers) i.e. the angel of death and his assistants (receive him, and they neglect not) they do not delay the time of death by even a fraction of a second."
