(Say) to Malik, O Muhammad: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is the prohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females, (or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? (Expound to me (the case) with knowledge, if ye are truthful) that Allah has made unlawful that which you claim."
