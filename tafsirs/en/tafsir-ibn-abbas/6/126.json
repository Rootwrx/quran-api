  "text": "(This is the path of thy Lord) this is the doing of your Lord, (a straight path) a just path; it is also said this means: This Islam is the religion of your Lord which He is pleased with; it is straight and well established. (We have detailed Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an, by explaining the commands and prohibitions, the causes of humiliation and the reasons for honour (for a people who take heed) for a people who understand and therefore believe. It is also said that (And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide) was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) and Abu Jahl; it is also said to have been revealed about 'Ammar Ibn Yasir and Abu Jahl."
