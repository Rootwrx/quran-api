  "text": "(There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings) between the earth and sky, (but they are peoples) creations and servants (like unto you) they resemble you in eating, copulation, understanding one another, just as you understand one another: this is a sign for you. (We have neglected nothing in the Book) We have neglected nothing that We have inscribed in the Preserved Tablet; We have mentioned everything in the Qur'an. (Then unto their Lord they) the birds and beasts (will be gathered) with all other created beings on the Day of Judgement."
