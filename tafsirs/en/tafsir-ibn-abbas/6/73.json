  "text": "(He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth) to expound the Truth and expose falsehood; it is also said that this means: to show that they are ephemeral and evanescent. (In that day when He saith) to the wall: (Be! it is) i.e. the heavens will become a wall which will be blown into, like one blows into a horn. Then the heaven will be changed into a different heaven; it is also said that (Be! it is) means: when He says to the Day of Judgement: \ufffdBe\ufffd, and it will be. (His word) regarding the resurrection (is the Truth, and His will be the Sovereignty) the judgement between the servants (on the Day when the trumpet is blown. Knower of the invisible) that which will happen in the future (and the visible) that which has already happened; it is also said that the 'invisible' refers to that which is unseen by people while 'the visible' refers to that which Allah's servants see, (He is the Wise) in His command and decree, (the Aware) of His created beings and of their works."
