  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth) of created beings? If they answer you, fine; if not, (Say: Unto Allah) belongs the creation of the heavens and the earth. (He hath prescribed for Himself mercy) for the Community of Muhammad (pbuh) in deferring His punishment, (that He may bring you all together) by Allah, He will bring you all together (to a Day) to the Day of Judgement (whereof there is no doubt. Those who ruin their own souls) as well as their dwellings, servants and spouses in Paradise (will not believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an."
