  "text": "(Lo! Allah (it is) who spliteth the grain) i.e. He creates all kinds of grains; it is also said that this means: He creates that which is in the grains (of corn and the date-stone (for sprouting)) just as He creates all that which contains stones. (He bringeth forth the living from the dead) He brings forth living creatures and beasts from sperm drops; it is also said that this means: He creates birds from eggs; and it is said that this means: He creates a spike of grain and fruits from grains and stones, (and is the bringer forth of the dead from the living) He brings forth sperms from living creatures and beasts; it is also said that this means: He creates eggs from birds; and it is said that this means: He creates grains from corn and fruits. (Such) who does this (is Allah) and not any other god. (How then are you perverted) why then do you lie?"
