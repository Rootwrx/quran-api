  "text": "(And of the camels) and He created of the camels (twain) male and female (and of the oxen twain) male and female. (Say) O Muhammad, to Malik: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is the prohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females, (or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? Another way of understanding this is as follows: is this prohibited because what is delivered is male or because it is female? (or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you (all) this) all that you claim? (Then who doth greater wrong) who is more insolent and bolder vis-\ufffd-vis Allah (than he who deviseth) invents (a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead mankind astray) from Allah's religion and obedience (without knowledge) from Allah. (Lo! Allah guideth not) does not direct to His religion and proof (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, meaning: Malik Ibn 'Awf."
