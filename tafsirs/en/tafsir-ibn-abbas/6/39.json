  "text": "(Those who deny our revelations) i.e. deny Muhammad and the Qur'an (are deaf) of heart; it is also said that this means: they pretend not to hear the Truth (and dumb) they pretend to be dumb in relation to the Truth and guidance (in darkness) i.e. they adhere to disbelief. (Whom Allah will He sendeth astray) He makes him die in a state of disbelief, (and whom He will) He makes him die such that (He placeth on a straight path) places on the straight path which He is pleased with; it is also said that this means: Allah forsakes whom He will and guides, gives success and firmness in adhering to the straight path (Islam), which He is pleased with, to whom He will."
