  "text": "(Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws) every bird with claws and every predatory animal with teeth, as well as every beast that has claws such as camels, ducks, geese, egrets and rabbits. All these were forbidden for them. (And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof) i.e. the fat spread between the bowels and intestines and the fat spread over the kidneys (save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone) such as the tail; all these were lawful for them. (That) which We made unlawful for them (We awarded them) We punished them (for their rebellion) because of their transgression We made all these forbidden for them. (And lo! We verily are Truthful) in what We have said."
