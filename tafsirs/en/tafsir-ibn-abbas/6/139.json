  "text": "(And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle) i.e. al-Bahirah and al-Wasilah (is reserved) lawful (for our males) men (and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead) or dies consequently, (then they (all)) males and females (may be partakers thereof) in eating its meat. (He will reward them) this is a threat to them (for their attribution (ordinances unto Him)) it is also said that this means: He will reward them with what will happen to them. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) saw 'Amr ibn Luhayy, who taught them the unlawfulness of the cattle described above, dragging his guts from his behind. (Lo, He is Wise) He made that which is lawful permitted, (Aware) of their ascription of unlawfulness to things that are lawful."
