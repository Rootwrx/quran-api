As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path) my Lord has honoured me with His religion and has commanded me to call people to His religion; it is also said that this means: my Lord has shown how to call people to His to (a right religion, the community of Abraham) the religion of Abraham, (the upright) who surrendered to Allah and (who was no idolater) he did not follow the idolaters in their religion."
