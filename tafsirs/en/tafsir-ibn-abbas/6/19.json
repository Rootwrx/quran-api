If they answer, fine, if not (Say: Allah is witness between you and me) that I am His Messenger and this Qur'an is His speech. (And this Qur'an hath been inspired in me) and that Gabriel has brought down this Qur'an to me, (that I may warn therewith you) with the Qur'an (and whomsoever it may reach) I am a warner to him. (Do ye) O people of Mecca (in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside Allah) i.e. idols: you say that they are Allah's daughters? And if they bear witness, (Say: I bear no such witness) with you. (Say) O Muhammad: (He is only One God) the true God is only One God. (Lo! I am innocent of that which you associate (with Him)) of idols in worship."
