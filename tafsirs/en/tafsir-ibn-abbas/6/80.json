  "text": "(His people argued with him) regarding their gods and threatened him by them so that he would leave the religion of Allah. (He) Abraham (said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah) do you argue with me in favour of your gods and threaten me so that I might leave the religion of my Lord (when He hath guided me) to His religion? (I fear not at all that which ye set beside Him) i.e. idols (unless my Lord willeth aught) to take away the knowledge from my heart such that I fear what you do. (My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge) my Lord knows that you do not follow the Truth: (Will ye not then remember) take admonition from the warning I am telling you about?"
