  "text": "(And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better) through protecting it and making it grow; (till he reach maturity) legal age and shows righteousness in his character. (Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task not any soul) upon measuring and weighing (beyond its scope) beyond its effort to establish justice. (And if you give your word, do justice thereunto) be truthful, (even though it be (against) a kinsman) you should be truthful and say what is true; (and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This He commandeth you that haply ye may remember) haply you may heed the admonition."
