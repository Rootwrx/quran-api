(Lo! the devils do inspire) whisper to (their minions) Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (to dispute with you) regarding the consumption of the meat of carrion, idolatry and about the angels being the daughters of Allah. (But if you obey them) in their idolatry and the consumption of the meat of carrion, declaring it lawful without being in dire need of it, (ye will be in truth idolaters) like them."
