  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad to Malik Ibn 'Awf and his fellows: (Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you) in the Scripture that was revealed to me: (that ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him) the first thing is that you do not associate with Him any of the idols (and that you do good to parents) you be dutiful to parents, (and that ye slay not your children) your daughters (because of penury) out of fear of humiliation and poverty. (We provide for you and for them) i.e. for your children (and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things) fornication (whether open) i.e. open fornication (or concealed) taking lovers in secret. (And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in the course of justice) as a result of cases such as retaliation, stoning, apostasy. (This He hath commanded you) in the Qur'an, (in order that you may discern) His command and divine Oneness."
