  "text": "(And forsake those who take their religion) the Jews, Christians, and the Arab polytheists who took the religion of their forefathers (for a pastime) a joke (and a jest) a mockery; it is also said that this means: religion for them is a merriness and fiction (and whom the life of the world beguileth) the comfort and bounties of the world beguiled them. (Remind (mankind) hereby) admonish through the Qur'an; it is also said this means: admonish by Allah (lest a soul be destroyed) be weakened and punished (by what it earneth) of sins. (It) the soul (hath beside Allah) against Allah's punishment (no friend) no close friend to defend it (nor intercessor) to intercede for it, (and though it offer every compensation) even if it brings all that which is on the face of the earth to compensate for it (it will not be accepted from it. Those) who mock (are they who perish) to be humiliated and punished; these are 'Uyaynah, al-Nadr and their folk, (by their own deserts) because of their own sins. (For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom, because they disbelieved) in Muhammad and the Qur'an."
