Sights will not comprehend the modality of seeing Him in the Hereafter nor will created beings be able to see Him in this world, (but He comprehendeth (all) vision) in this world and in the Hereafter: He sees that which human beings do not see and nothing escapes or is hidden from Him. (He is the Subtile) in His actions whose knowledge surrounds His created beings, (the Aware) of His created beings and their actions."
