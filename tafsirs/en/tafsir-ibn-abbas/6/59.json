  "text": "(And with Him are the keys of the invisible) the stores of the unseen: rain, vegetation, fruits, and the descent of punishment you asked for on the Day of Badr. (None but He knoweth them) no one knows the keys of the unseen: when the punishment for which you are impatient will come down on you. (And He knoweth what is in the land and the sea) of created beings and marvels; it is also said that this means: Allah knows what He destroys in the land and in the sea. (Not a leaf falleth) from a tree (but He knoweth it) He knows how many times it spins in the air before it falls, (not a grain amid the darkness of the earth) under a rock at the bottom of the earth except that He knows it, (naught of wet) i.e. water (or dry) steppe (but (it is noted) in a) written (clear record) all of it is in the Guarded Tablet: with their precise measure and time."
