  "text": "(Repel not) O Muhammad, because of what 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari has said-he said: \ufffdrepel these from you so that the nobles of Mecca come to you, hear you and believe in you\ufffd-and these nobles also asked 'Umar to request the Prophet (pbuh) to allocate one day for them and another for weak believers, but Allah rejected this and warned them against such a deed, (those who call upon their Lord) Salman and his fellow believers, among the clients, who worship their Lord (at morn and evening) through performing the five daily prayers, (seeking His Countenance) and by doing so they only seek Allah's Countenance and good pleasure. (Thou art not accountable for them) for their provision (in aught, nor are they accountable for you) for your provision (in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong-doers) of those who harm themselves."
