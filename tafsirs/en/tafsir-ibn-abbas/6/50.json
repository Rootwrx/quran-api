  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I say not unto you (that) I possess) the keys to (the treasures of Allah): vegetations, fruits, rain or punishment, (nor that I have knowledge of the Unseen) when punishment is inflicted; (and I say not unto you: Lo! I am an angel) from heaven. (I follow) I do and say (only that which is inspired in me) only that which I am commanded with in the Qur'an. (Say) O Muhammad: (Are the blind man and the seer equal?) Are the believer and disbeliever equal in acts of obedience and reward? (Will ye not then take thought) about the similes of the Qur'an? This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his companions al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and 'Uyaynah, and then it was revealed about the clients."
