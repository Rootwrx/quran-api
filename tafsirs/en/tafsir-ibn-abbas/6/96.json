  "text": "(He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak) He is the Creator of the morning of the day, (and He hath appointed the night for stillness) for created beings, (and the sun and the moon) and He has created the sun and the moon (for reckoning) i.e. their phases change according to precise measures; it is also said that this means: the sun and the moon are suspended between the sky and the earth, rotating. (That is the measuring of the Mighty) i.e. through the providence of the Mighty in retribution vis-\ufffd-vis whoever does not believe in him, (the Wise) in His providence and who knows those who believe in Him and those who do not."
