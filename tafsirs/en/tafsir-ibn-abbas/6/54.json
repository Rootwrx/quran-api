Allah has accepted your repentance and excuse (Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy) for anyone who repents, (that whoso of you doeth evil) sins (through ignorance) intentionally even though he did not know its due punishment (and repenteth afterward thereof) and repents of this sin (and doeth right) in relation to that which is between him and his Lord, ((for him) lo! Allah is Forgiving) He overlooks sins, (Merciful) towards him who repents."
