(Allah knoweth best with whom to place His message) He knows best to whom He sends Gabriel with His message. (Humiliation) degradation and abasement (from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the guilty) the idolaters, i.e. al-Walid and his friends (for their scheming) for their denial of the messengers."
