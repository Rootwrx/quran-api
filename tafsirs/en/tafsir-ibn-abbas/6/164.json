  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad: (Shall I seek another than Allah for Lord) shall I worship other than Allah, (when He is Lord of all things) when everything is from Him? (Each soul earneth) of sins (only on its own account) as a punishment, (nor doth any laden bear another's load) of sins; it is also said that this means: no soul shall be taken to task for the sins of another soul; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be tormented for committing no sin; as it is said that this means: no soul bears the burden of another soul with pleasure; it does so only when it is forced. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after you die (and He will tell you that wherein) in Religion (you differed) you contravened."
