  "text": "(Lo! As for those who sunder their religion) those who have left the religion of their forefathers; it is also said that this means: those turned back on their pledge on the Day of the primordial Covenant; it can also be understood to mean: those who differed in their religion (and become schismatics) they became different groups: Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, (no concern at all hast thou with them) you are not required to fight them. However, he was later commanded to fight them. It is also said that this means: their repentance or punishment are not in your hands. (Their case will go to Allah, who then will tell them what they used to do) of good and evil."
