(And if the devil cause thee to forget) after being warned against it, (sit not, after the remembrance) after being reminded, (with the congregation of wrong-doers) the idolaters. Allah commanded His Prophet with this in Mecca, but the prophetic Companions found it hard to implement. They were later given dispensation to sit with the idolaters so as to admonish and warn them."
