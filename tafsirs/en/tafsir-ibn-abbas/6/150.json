(And if they) falsely (bear witness) that they are forbidden, (do not you bear witness with them. Follow thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an, (those who believe not in the Hereafter) in resurrection after death (and deem (others) equal with their Lord) take idols as His partners."
