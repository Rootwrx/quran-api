(Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed upon you) of crops and cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) what the devil has made seem fair by forbidding some crops and cattle, (for lo! he is an open foe to you) whose enmity is quite manifest, for he commands you to forbid some crops and cattle."
