  "text": "(Such was the punishment) in the life of the world for the one who refrains from giving Allah's due from his wealth, just as Allah burnt their garden and exposed them to hunger; it is also said that this means: such is the punishment of the life of the world as happened to the people of Mecca who were exposed to hunger and death. (And verily the punishment of the Hereafter) for he who does not repent (is greater) than the punishment of the life of the world (if they did but know) if the people of Mecca did but knew, but they do not know nor do they believe in this."
