(Enter not houses other than your own) you are not permitted to enter houses (without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That) announcing your presence and invoking peace (is better for you) and more akin to righteousness, (that ye may be heedful) that you may take admonition and not enter in on each other without permission."
