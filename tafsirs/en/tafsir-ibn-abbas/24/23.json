  "text": "Allah then revealed the following about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host who slandered 'A'ishah and Safwan: (Lo! as for those who traduce) accusing them of adultery (virtuous) and free, (believing) they believe in Allah's divine Oneness (women) i.e. 'A'ishah ((who are) careless) who are chaste and exonerated from adultery, (cursed are they) they should be punished (in the world) by flogging them (and the Hereafter) by casting them in the Fire. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Theirs) the reference here is to 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy and his host (will be an awful doom) more severe than the chastisement they will be exposed to in this worldly life."
