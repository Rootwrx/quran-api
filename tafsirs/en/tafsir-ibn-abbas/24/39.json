The thirsty one supposeth it to be water) from far (till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught) he finds that it is not water; similarly, the disbeliever will not find any reward for his works in the Hereafter, (and finds, in the place thereof, Allah) and he finds with Allah the punishment for the sins he committed; it is also said that this means: and finds Allah ready to chastise him, (Who payeth him his due) Who inflict on him his punishment; (and Allah is swift at reckoning) Allah is severe in His punishment; it is also said that this means: when Allah takes people to task His reckoning is swift."
