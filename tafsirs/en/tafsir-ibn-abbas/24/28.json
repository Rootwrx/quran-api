(And if it be said unto you: Go away again) and if you are told not to enter, (then go away) and remain not standing at the door of people's houses, (for it is purer for you) for it is better for you than to remain standing at the doors of people's houses. (Allah knoweth what ye do) of asking permission and other things."
