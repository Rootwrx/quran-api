  "text": "He also revealed about them: (Vile women) those who are vile in their speech and deeds (are for vile men) they deserve vile men, (and vile men for vile women) they deserve one another. (Good women) good women in their speech and deeds (are for good men) they deserve them, (and good men for good women) they deserve one another; it is also said that this means: good women, i.e. 'A'ishah, are for good men, i.e. the Prophet (pbuh); (such) 'A'ishah and Safwan (are innocent of that which people say) they are innocent of people's slander: (For them is pardon) their sins are pardoned in the life of this world (and a bountiful provision) in Paradise. He says: when any man or woman are praised, and they deserve such a praise, then whatever they are praised with is true. And when a vile man or woman are mentioned with ill, and they deserve such an ill mention, then they deserve being mentioned in an ill manner."
