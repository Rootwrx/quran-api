  "text": "(They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger) privately and in the open (and, when they are with him) with the Prophet (pbuh) (on some common errand) on Friday or in a military expedition, (go not away) from the mosque or from the military expedition (until they have asked leave of him) ask permission from the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! those who ask leave of thee) O Muhammad to return from the battle of Tabuk; this refers to 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who asked the Prophet (pbuh) to give him leave to return to Medina because of an ailment which visited him, (those are they who believe in Allah and His messenger) in private and openly. (So, if they ask thy leave) so if sincere believers ask you, O Muhammad, (for some affair of theirs) for a need of theirs, (give leave to whom thou wilt of them) of the sincere believers, (and ask for them forgiveness of Allah) regarding that for which they have gone. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the one who repents, (Merciful) He shows mercy towards the one who dies repentant."
