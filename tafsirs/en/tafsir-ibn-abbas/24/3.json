(All that) marrying the slaves of the people of the Book and the slaves of Arab idolaters (is forbidden unto believers) this verse was revealed about a group among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who wanted to marry some slaves from the people of the Book and Arab idolaters in Medina. These slaves were known adulteresses but these prophetic Companions wanted to marry them in order to win them over. When this verse was revealed they refrained from marrying them."
