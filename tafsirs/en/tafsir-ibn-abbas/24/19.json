Those) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (who love that slander should be spread) appear (concerning those who believe) 'A'ishah and Safwan, (theirs will be a painful punishment) by being flogged (in the world and the Hereafter) by being thrown in hell, especially 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Allah knoweth) that 'A'ishah and Safwan did not commit adultery. (Ye know not) this."
