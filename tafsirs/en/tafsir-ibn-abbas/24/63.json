You should rather respect him, show deference towards him and honour him by saying: \" O Prophet of Allah \" , \" O Messenger of Allah \" , \" O Abu'l-Qasim \": (Allah knoweth those of you who steal away) from the mosque, (hiding themselves) the hypocrites used to leave the mosque without permission when no one could see them. (And let those who conspire to evade orders) the orders of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh); it is also said that this means: the orders of Allah (beware lest grief) a calamity (or painful punishment) beating (befall them."
