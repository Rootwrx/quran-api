  "text": "(The adulterer and the adulteress) who are unmarried and have not been married before, (scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes) flog each one of them a hundred times. (And let not pity for the twain) for applying the legal punishment (withhold you from obedience to Allah) withhold you from executing Allah's legal ruling on them, (if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrection after death. (And let a party of believers) one man, two or more so that the punishment is preserved (witness their punishment) witness the execution of the punishment."
