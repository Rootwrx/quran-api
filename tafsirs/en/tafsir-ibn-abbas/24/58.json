  "text": "Then the following was revealed when 'Umar said: \" I wish that Allah forbids our children and servants from entering in on us except with permission at three times when we are likely to be exposed \": (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Let your slaves) young slaves, (and those of you who have not come to puberty) among those who are not slaves, (ask leave of you) to enter in on you (at three times: Before the prayer of dawn) from the time of dawn until the beginning of Fajr prayer, (and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon) for the time of the siesta until the prayer of Zuhr, (and after the prayer of night) and after the 'Isha' prayer to the break of dawn. (Three times of privacy for you). Then Allah gave them dispensation to enter without permission, saying: (It is no sin for them) for the children or young slaves, excepting from this older slaves, (or for you) for the masters of the house (at other times) other than those three times of privacy, (when some of you go round) to serve (attendant upon others) you and them can enter in on each other without permission. As for older children and older slaves they have to ask permission at all times before entering in on their parents or masters. (Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you) He explains the commands and prohibitions just as He explained this. (Allah is Knower) He knows what is good for you, (Wise) He decreed that young children and slaves ask permission in those three times of privacy."
