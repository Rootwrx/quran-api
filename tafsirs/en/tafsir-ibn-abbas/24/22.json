  "text": "Allah then revealed the following about Abu Bakr when he swore that he will not spend on his relatives, Mistah and others, because they talked about the slandering of 'A'ishah: (And let not those who possess dignity) through their spending (and ease) due to their wealth (among you swear not to give to the near of kin) Mistah was his maternal cousin (and to the needy) beside being his cousin, Mistah was also poor, (and to fugitives for the cause of Allah) and to the Immigrants for the sake of Allah, for Mistah was also an Immigrant. (Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you) do you not want, O Abu Bakr, that Allah forgive you? (Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards the person who repents. When he heard this, Abu Bakr said: \" I do indeed, O my Lord! \" and so after the revelation of this verse, he showed kindness to his relatives and helped them financially."
