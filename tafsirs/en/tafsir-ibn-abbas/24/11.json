(Deem it not) deem not the slandering of 'A'ishah and Safwan (a bad thing for you) in the Hereafter; (say, it is good for you) in terms of reward. (Unto every man of them) who engaged in slandering 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal (will be paid that which he hath earned of the sin) in accordance to his engagement in the slander; (and as for him among them who had the greater share therein) the one who spread the matter and uttered abominable things concerning this matter, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (his will be an awful doom) in this worldly life by imposing the legal punishment on him and in the Hereafter by being cast in hell."
