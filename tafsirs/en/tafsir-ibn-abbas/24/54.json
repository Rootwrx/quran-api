  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to 'Uthman: (Obey Allah) regarding the obligations (and obey the messenger) in his wont and judgement. (But if you turn away) but if they turn away from obeying both, (then (it is) for him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged) what he has been commanded to convey, (and for you (to do) only that wherewith you have been charged) what you have been commanded to respond. (If ye obey him) if you obey Allah in that which He commands you, (ye will go aright) and avoid error. (But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly) from Allah."
