  "text": "(Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea) He says: the similitude of denial in the heart of the disbeliever is like darkness in the depth of a very deep sea. (There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave) another wave, (above which is a cloud) likewise, the heart of the disbeliever, like the denial in his heart, is similar to the darkness of the bottom of the sea; and his heart is like a deep sea; and his chest is like a huge wave, and his works are like a useless cloud, because Allah sealed the disbelievers hearts and hearings and sights. (Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it) from intense darkness; likewise, the disbeliever does not see the Truth and guidance because of the intense darkness of his heart. (And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light) knowledge in this worldly life, (for him there is no light) he has no knowledge in the Hereafter; it is also said that this means: the one whom Allah has not honoured with faith in the life of this world, Allah will not honour with faith in the Hereafter."
