  "text": "Allah then warned the believers from following Satan, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Follow not the footsteps of the devil) do not follow Satan's embellishment and whisperings. (Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil) whoever follows Satan's embellishment and whisperings, (lo! he commandeth filthiness) evil words and deeds (and wrong) that which is not in the Shari'ah or the Sunnah. (Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) through preserving you from sins and giving you success, (not one of you would ever have grown pure) no one of you would profess Allah's divine Oneness or become righteous. (But Allah causeth whom He will to grow) but Allah gives success and makes righteous whoever deserves it. (And Allah is Hearer) He hears what you say, (Knower) He knows you and your works."
