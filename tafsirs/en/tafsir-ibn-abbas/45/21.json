And so Allah said: or do they (suppose that We shall make them) that We shall make the disbelievers in terms of reward in the Hereafter (as those who believe) 'Ali and his two fellow believers (and do good works) and do acts of obedience privately between themselves and their Lord, (the same life and death?) the life of the believer in his state of faith and his death in a state of faith cannot be the same as the life of the disbeliever who lives and dies in transgression and disbelief while Allah is angry with him. (Bad is their judgement) evil is that which they judge for themselves!"
