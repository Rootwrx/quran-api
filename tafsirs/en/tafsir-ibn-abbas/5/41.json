  "text": "(O Messenger!) O Muhammad (Let not them grieve you who vie one with another in the race to disbelief) in allying themselves with the disbelievers in this world and in the Hereafter, (of such as say with their mouths) with their tongues: (\ufffdWe believe,\ufffd) in our hearts (but their hearts believe not) i.e. the hearts of the hypocrites, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers, (and of the Jews) i.e. the Jews of the Banu Qurayzah, Ka'b and his followers: (listeners for the sake of falsehood) listeners of untruth, (listeners on behalf of other folk) the people of Khaybar (who come not unto thee) regarding what happened among them, but Banu Qurayzah asked about them, (changing words) changing the traits and description of Muhammad and the legal ruling on the stoning of married people who commit adultery (from their context) after being exposited in the Torah (and saying) i.e. the leaders to their followers; it is also said: the hypocrites 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers: (If this be given unto you) if Muhammad (pbuh) command you to whip [married people who committed adultery], (receive it) accept it from him and act according to it (but if this be not given unto you) if Muhammad does not command you to whip them and instead commands you to stone them, (then beware!) i.e. beware of following him if does not command you to whip them and, instead, commands you to stone them. Allah said: (He whom Allah doometh unto sin) he whom Allah wants to persist in his disbelief and idolatry; it is also said: he whom Allah wants to expose; and it is also said that this means: he whom Allah wants to test, (thou (by thine efforts) will avail him naught against Allah) against Allah's punishment. (Those are) the Jews and the hypocrites (they for whom the will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts) from scheming, treachery and persistence in disbelief. (Theirs in the world will be ignominy) punishment through killing and expulsion, (and in the Hereafter an awful doom) more severe than the punishment they suffer in this world;"
