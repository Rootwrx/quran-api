  "text": "(The Jews) Finhas Ibn 'Azura', the Jew (say: Allah's hand is fettered) and cannot give. (Their hands are fettered) they neither do good nor spend in good causes (and they are accursed) they are punished by the imposition of the capitation tax on them (for saying so. Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide in bounty) His hands are wide open for both the righteous and the sinner. (He bestoweth as He will) if He wishes, He gives, and if He wishes, He withholds. (That which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord) i.e. the Qur'an, by Allah it (is certain to increase the contumacy) constancy upon disbelief (and disbelief) firmness in disbelief (of many of them) of the disbelievers, (and We have cast among them) the Jews and Christians (enmity) manifested in killing and destruction (and hatred) in their hearts (till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they light a fire for war) whenever they unite to kill Muhammad out of disobedience, (Allah extinguisheth it) Allah makes them disunite and oppose each other. (Their effort is for corruption in the land) they cause corruption in the land through preventing people from Muhammad and by inviting to other than Allah, (and Allah loveth not corrupters) the Jews and their religion."
