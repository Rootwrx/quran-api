  "text": "(When the disciples) the chosen among them, Simon the Pure (said: O Jesus, son of Mary!) your people are asking: (Is thy Lord able) would your Lord; and it is also said that this means: could you pray to your Lord (to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said:) Jesus said to Simon: tell them (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah, (if ye are true believers) if you have firm faith, for it may happen that you would not give gratitude for it and, as a result, be punished. And so Simon conveyed the message to them."
