  "text": "Then Allah revealed about a group of men from the Emigrants and the Helpers who asked the Prophet (pbuh): \ufffdwhat shall happen to those of us who died drinking intoxicant drinks before they were made unlawful\ufffd, saying: (There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) that is between them and their Lord (for what they may have eaten (in the past)) for what they have drunk in the past before intoxicants were made unlawful, whether those who did it are dead or still living. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) if they warded off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, (and do good works) that is between them and their Lord; (and again: be mindful of your duty) ward off making intoxicants lawful after they were made unlawful; this address is to the believers who are still living, (and believe) in the unlawfulness of intoxicant; (and once again: be mindful of your duty) ward off drinking it, (and do right) leave the drinking of it. (Allah loveth the good) for avoiding drinking intoxicants; this relates to those who were still alive and who drunk intoxicants before they were made unlawful."
