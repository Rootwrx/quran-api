Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity) in justice, (and let not hatred of any people) the hatred of Shurayh Ibn Shurahbil (seduce you) drive you (that ye deal not justly) with the pilgrims of the clan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il. (Deal justly) with them, (that is nearer to your duty) justice is nearer to God-fearingness as far as the God-fearing are concerned. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding justice and injustice. (Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do) whether it is justice or injustice."
