(If then they) i.e. the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir (have recourse unto thee) O Muhammad (judge between them) between the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir; and it is also said: between the people of Khaybar (or disclaim jurisdiction) by choice. (If thou disclaimest jurisdiction) and do not judge between them, (then they cannot harm thee at all) they cannot take away anything from you. (But if thou judgest) between the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir; and it is also said: between the people of Khaybar, (judge between them with equity) with stoning [married people who commit adultery]. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) who are fair when they judge with the Book of Allah and who apply the legal ruling of stoning."
