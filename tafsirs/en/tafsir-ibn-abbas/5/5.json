  "text": "(This day) the day of the pilgrimage (are (all) good things) that which has been immolated (made lawful for you. The food) the animals immolated (of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you) as long as it is not prohibited, (and your food) your immolated animals (is lawful for them) both the Jews and Christians can consume that which the Muslims immolate. (And so are the) free (virtuous women of the believers) are lawful for you to marry (and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you) lawful for you to marry (when ye give them their marriage portions) their dowry, in surplus of the price given to the prostitute in exchange for sex (and live with them in honour) in wedlock, (not in) flagrant (fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines.) This was revealed about the women of Mecca when they boasted to the women of Medina. Allah said: (Whoso denieth the faith) Allah's divine Oneness, (his work is vain) in this world (and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter) he will be of those who have been duped since he will be deprived of Paradise and enter hell."
