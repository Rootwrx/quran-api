(Stress not in your religion) do not be extreme in your religion (other than the Truth) for it is not the Truth, (and follow not the vain desires of folk) the religion and claims of a folk (who erred) from the guidance (of old) before you; these are the leaders (and led many astray) from guidance, (and erred from a plain road) they missed the road of guidance."
