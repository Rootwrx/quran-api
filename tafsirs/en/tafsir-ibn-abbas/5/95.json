(Whoso of you killeth it of set purpose) this verse was revealed about Abu'l-Yusr Ibn 'Amr who intentionally killed game, forgetting he was in ritual consecration, (he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which he hath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you known for justice) two judges will evaluate such equivalence; ((the forfeit) to be brought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or, for expiation, he shall feed poor persons) or he should give money for it by feeding some of the poor of Mecca, (or the equivalent thereof in fasting) if he cannot feed the poor, he should fast one for each half measure (Sa') of food he is supposed to feed to the poor, (that he may taste the evil consequences) the punishment (of his deed. Allah forgiveth whatever (of this kind) may have happened in the past) before it was made unlawful, (but whoso relapseth) after being condemned and beaten severely in this world, (Allah will take retribution from him) he should be left until Allah takes retribution from him. (Allah is Mighty) in His retribution, (Able to Requite (the wrong)) Able to punish those who do wrong."
