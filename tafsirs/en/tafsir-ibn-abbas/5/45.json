(But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity)) whoever forgoes retaliating (it shall be expiation for him) i.e. for the harmed person; it is also said: for the person who harmed. (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed) Allah says: whoever does not show what the Qur'an has shown nor act according to it: (such are wrong-doers) who harm themselves with punishment."
