(Now hath Our messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (come unto you to make things plain) that with which you have been commanded and that which you have been prohibited (after an interval) of cessation (of the messengers, lest ye should say) so that you will not say on the Day of Judgement: (There came not unto us a messenger of cheer) announcing Paradise (nor any warner) against hell. (Now hath a messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (of cheer) announcing Paradise (and a warner) against hell (come unto you. Allah is Able to do all things): whether it be sending messengers, rewarding those who follow the messengers or punishing those who do not follow the messengers."
