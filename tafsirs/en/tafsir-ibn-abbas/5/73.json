  "text": "(They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the third of three) this is the claim of the Marqusiyyah; they claim that there is a father, a son and a holy Spirit; (when there is no God) for the dwellers of the heavens and the earth (save the One God) who has no son or partner. (If they desist not from so saying) He says: if the Jews and Christians do not repent of what they are saying (a painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve) the pain of which will extend to their hearts."
