Remember My favour) recollect My grace (unto thee) by bestowing prophethood upon you (and unto thy mother) by gracing her with complete surrender to Allah and with worship; (how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit) the pure Gabriel: he taught and helped you talk to people, (so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle) in your mother's lap and in your cot, saying: I am Allah's servant and anointed one (as in maturity) as did Gabriel help you after you reached your thirtieth year when you said to them: I am Allah's Messenger to you; (and how I taught you the Scripture) the Scriptures of past prophets; and it is said that this means: writing with the pen (and Wisdom) the wisdom of past sages; it is also said that this means: the lawful and the unlawful (and the Torah) and taught you the Torah in the womb of your mother (and the Gospel) after you were born; (and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird) a bat (by My permission) by My command, (and didst blow upon it) like the breathing of a sleeping person (and it was a bird) flying in the air (by My permission) by My command and will, (and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission) by My command, will and power; (and how thou didst raise the dead) by means of My will and through Me give life to the dead, (by My permission and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you) when they decided to kill you (when thou camest unto them with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and the wondrous things that you showed them, (and those of them who disbelieved) from among the Children of Israel (exclaimed: This) which Jesus is showing us (is naught else than mere magic);"
