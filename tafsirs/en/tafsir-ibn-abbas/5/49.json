(And if they turn away) from applying the legal ruling of stoning and from that which you judged between them regarding retaliation, (then know that Allah's will is to smite them) to punish them (for some sin of theirs) for all their sins. (Lo! many of mankind) of the people of the Book (are evil-doers) disbelievers who break their covenants."
