  "text": "(Allah said) to Jesus, tell them: (Lo! I send it down for you) that which you have asked for. (And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward) after sending it down and eating from it, (him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures) of his time: I will turn them into swine. But after they ate from the food, they said: this is clear magic. Jesus said in response: O Allah! If you punish them for what they are saying, they are Your servants; but if you forgive them, You are Mighty in Your retribution towards him who does not repent."
