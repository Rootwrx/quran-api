(The Messiah (himself) said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness, (my Lord and your Lord. Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah) and dies in this state, (for him Allah hath forbidden Paradise. His abode) his end result (is the Fire. For evil-doers) idolaters (there will be no helpers) to save them from what is intended for them."
