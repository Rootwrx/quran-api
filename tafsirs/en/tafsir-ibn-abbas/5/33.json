  "text": "The following verse was revealed about the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir who killed a group of people from the Banu Kinanah. This group wanted to emigrate to Medina to see Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and declare their Islam. However, they were all killed and their belongings taken as booty. Hence, Allah explained the punishment of the people of the Banu Hilal, who were idolaters, saying: (The only reward) requital (of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger) of those who disbelieve in Allah and His messenger (and strive after corruption in the land) and engage in sin in the land, i.e. by wrongfully killing others and taking their properties (will be that they will be killed) He says: the punishment of one who kills and does not take the victim's property is that he be killed (or crucified) He says: the punishment of one who kills a person and also takes his property is that he be crucified, (or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off) the right hand and the left leg. He says: the punishment of one who takes another's property but does not kill is that his hand and leg be cut off, (or will be expelled out of the land) or he will be put in prison until he displays righteousness and his repentance becomes apparent. Allah says: the punishment of someone who terrorises people as a highway robber but does not kill or take anyone's property is that he be imprisoned. (Such) that which I have mentioned (will be their degradation) their punishment (in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom) more severe than their punishment which they suffered in this world, that is, if the person does not repent;"
