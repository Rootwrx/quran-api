  "text": "(They ask thee) O Muhammad; the people who so asked were Zayd Ibn Muhalhil al-Ta'i and 'Adiyy Ibn Hatim al-Ta'i, both fishermen (what is made lawful for them) of game. (Say: (all) good things) all the immolated ones (are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them) to abstain from eating game (that which Allah taught you) as Allah has taught you; (so eat of that which they) the trained dogs (catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it) upon immolating your game; and it is also said: upon sending the trained dogs upon the game, (and observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah about eating the meat of carrion. (Lo! Allah is swift to take account) His punishment is severe; it is also said that this means: when He is swift when He takes people to task."
