  "text": "(Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven) it is also said that this means: send down for us the grace of food, for they already had some food with them, (that it may be a feast for Us, for the first of us) the people of our own time (and for the last of us) those who come after us, so that we worship you on this day, which happened to be a Sunday, (and a sign from You) for he who believes and an argument against he who disbelieves. (Give us sustenance) give us that which we have asked for, (for Thou art the Best of Sustainers) the Best of those who feed others."
