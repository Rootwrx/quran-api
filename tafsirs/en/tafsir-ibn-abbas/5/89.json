  "text": "(Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths) Allah does not take you to task for the expiation of unintentional oaths, (but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear in earnest) He takes you to task for the intention of your hearts when you make oaths. (The expiation thereof) the expiation of the oath which is not unintentional (is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk) of bread and seasoning which you feed to them at lunch and dinner, (or the clothing of them) or the clothing of ten needy people whereby their nudity is covered: a shawl, a gown or a loin cloth, (or the liberation of a slave) whichever it is of these three options, (and for him who finds not (the wherewithal to do so)) any one of these three options (then a three day fast) consecutively. (This) which I have mentioned (is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn) and do not honour your oath; (and keep your oaths) the uttering of your oaths as well as the expiation of your oaths. (Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations) His commands and prohibitions, as He expounds the expiation of oaths (in order that ye may give thanks) in order that you may show gratitude for expositing His commands and prohibitions."
