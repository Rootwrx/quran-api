  "text": "(They thought no harm would come of it,) no misfortune would ensue; it is also said that: they thought that their hearts would not be corrupted because of denying and killing messengers (so they were wilfully blind) and did not see guidance (and deaf) such that they did not hear the Truth deep in their hearts. They disbelieved and then they believed and repented from their disbelief. (And afterward Allah turned (in mercy) towards them) He forgave them. (Now (even after that) are many of them wilfully blind) do not see guidance and died in this state (and deaf) such they do not hear the Truth and become disbelievers. (Allah is Seer of what they do) in their disbelief in terms of denying and killing the prophets."
