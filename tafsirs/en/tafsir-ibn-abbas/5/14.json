(Therefore We have stirred up) We have cast (enmity) killing and destruction (and hatred) in the hearts (among them) between the Jews and Christians; and it is said between the Nestorians of Najran, the sects known as the Jacobites, the Marqusiyya and the Melkites (till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform them of their handiwork) of their opposition, treachery, concealment, enmity and hatred."
