Strong drink) which intoxicates the mind (and games of chance) all types of games of chance (and idols) the worship of idols (and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork) they are unlawful because they are instigated by order of the devil and his whispering. (Leave it aside) avoid it (in order that ye may succeed) in order that you may escape Allah's anger and punishment and be safe in the Hereafter."
