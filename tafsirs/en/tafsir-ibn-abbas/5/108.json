  "text": "(Thus it is more likely) it is more appropriate and worthier (that they) the Christians (will hear true witness or fear) i.e. the Christians (that after their oath the oath (of others) will be taken) i.e. the oath of the Muslims will be taken, so let them not withhold their testimony. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding that which is entrusted to you (and hearken) to that with which you are commanded and obey Allah. (Allah guideth not the froward folk) He does not guide to His religion or clear proof lying, transgressing disbelievers nor does He guide those who are not fit for His guidance."
