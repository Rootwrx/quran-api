(Make known that which hath been revealed unto you from your Lord) of reviling their goddesses, denouncing their religion, fighting against them, and inviting people to Islam (for if ye do it not) that which you have been commanded with, (you will not have conveyed His message) as it ought to be conveyed. (Allah will protect you from mankind) from the Jews and others. (Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk) He does not guide to His religion anyone who is not fit for it."
