  "text": "(O ye who believe! Profane not Allah's monuments) do not make lawful the abstention from all of Allah's rites (nor the Sacred Month) nor attacking people in the Sacred Month (nor the offerings) nor the taking of offerings which are made to the House (nor the garlands) nor the taking of the garlands which are hung by the advent of the Sacred Month, (nor those repairing to the Sacred House) nor attacking those who head for Allah's Sacred House, i.e. the pilgrims of al-Yamamah-the clan of the idolater Bakr Ibn Wa'il-and the traders of the idolater Shurayh Ibn Dabi'ah, (seeking the grace) provision (and pleasure of Allah) by means of the pilgrimage. It is also said that this means: they seek provision by means of trade and also Allah's pleasure. (But when ye have left the sacred territory) after the days of Tashriq, (then go hunting (if ye will)) if you will, go hunt wild game. (And let not your hatred of a folk) the hatred of the people of Mecca (who (once) stopped your going to the Inviolable Place of Worship) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah (seduce you) drive you (to transgress) against the pilgrims of the clan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il; (but help ye one another unto righteousness) acts of obedience (and pious duty) shunning transgressions. (Help not one another unto sin) contraventions (and transgression) against the pilgrims of the clan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il, (but keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in that which He has commanded and prohibited you. (Lo! Allah is severe in punishment) when He punishes those who abstain from that which He has commanded."
