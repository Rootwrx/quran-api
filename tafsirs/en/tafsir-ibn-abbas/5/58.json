  "text": "(And when ye call to prayer) through the call to prayer (adhan) and the call announcing the start of the prayer (iqamah) (they take it for a jest and sport) they take it as a joke and falsehood. (That) jest (is because they are a folk who understand not) Allah's command nor do they know Allah's divine Oneness nor His religion. This verse was revealed about a Jewish man who used to poke fun at Bilal's call to prayer, and so Allah burned him."
