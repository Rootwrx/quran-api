What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and religion, (and no guidance) to the practice of any prophet; it is also said that this means: were not their fathers completely ignorant of the religion and not guided to the practice of the Prophet? How then can their example be followed?"
