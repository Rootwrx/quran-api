  "text": "(To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you) this was revealed about a people from the Banu Mudlij who lived off the sea. They asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the fish of the sea and about that which is washed out of the sea, so Allah revealed that it is lawful to fish just as it is lawful to eat that which is washed out by the sea (a provision for you) a benefit for you (and for seafarers; but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Be mindful of your duty to Allah) fear Allah, (unto Whom ye will be gathered) and questioned about the game made forbidden for you during ritual consecration and at the Sacred Precinct."
