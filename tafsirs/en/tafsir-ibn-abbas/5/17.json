(Say) to these Christians, O Muhammad: (Who then can do aught against Allah) who can save from Allah's punishment, (if He had willed to destroy) to punish (the Messiah son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth?) who worshipped her. (Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) to Him belong the stores of the heavens and earth (and all that is between them) of created things and marvels. (He createth what He will) as He wills, whether a father exists or not. (And Allah is Able to do all things) in terms of creating created beings, rewarding His allies and punishing His enemies."
