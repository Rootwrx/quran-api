He) Jesus (saith: Be glorified! It was not mine) it was not proper nor was it permissible (to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it) to them, (then Thou knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind) you know that which I have conveyed to them of commands and prohibitions, (and I know not what is in Thy mind) I do not know what proceeded from you to them in terms of forsakenness or success. (Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden) things hidden from the servants."
