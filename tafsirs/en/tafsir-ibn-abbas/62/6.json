These are the sons of Judah (If ye claim that you are favoured of Allah) if you claim you are the beloved of Allah (apart from (all) mankind) apart from Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions, (then long for death) then ask for death (if ye are truthful) that you are favoured by Allah apart from Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions. That is to say, say: O Allah! Make us die! For by Allah, there is not a single one of them who says this except that he will die."
