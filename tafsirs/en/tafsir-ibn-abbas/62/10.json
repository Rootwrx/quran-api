  "text": "Allah then gave them a dispensation, after imposing a prohibition upon them, in His saying (and leave your trading) and said: (And when the prayer is ended) when the Imam finishes the Friday prayer, (then disperse in the land) then leave the mosque if you wish (and seek of Allah's bounty) and seek Allah's provision if you wish, and this is the dispensation which came after prohibition. There is also another way of understanding this: when the Imam finishes the Friday prayer, disperse in the mosque and seek that which is better for you, i.e. the hidden knowledge, Oneness, non-attachment and reliance on Allah, (and remember Allah) with your tongues and hearts (much) in all circumstances, (that ye may be successful) that you may escape Allah's chastisement and wrath."
