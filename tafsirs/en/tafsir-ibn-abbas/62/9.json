(When the call is heard for the prayer) when the call to prayer calls you for the prayer (of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah) haste to the sermon of the Imam and to praying with him (and leave your trading) and leave trading after the call to prayer. (That) listening to the sermon of the Imam and prayer (is better for you) than earning money and trading (if ye did but know) if you believe in the reward of Allah."
