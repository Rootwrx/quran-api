  "text": "(They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee) they meant: the hardship that we face is due to your evil omen and the evil omen of those who believed in you. (He said) Salih said: (Your evil augury) your hardship as well as your comfort (is with Allah) are from Allah. (Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested) by hardship and comfort; it is also said that this means: you are forsaken rather than being given success."
