  "text": "Allah then commanded him to fight, saying: (And say) O Muhammad: (Praise be to Allah) gratitude and divine Oneness are Allah's (who will show you His portents) the signs of His divine Oneness and power by inflicting torment upon you on the Day of Badr (so that ye shall know them) so that you shall know that what Muhammad (pbuh) tells you is true. (And your Lord is not unaware) oblivious (of what ye do) in your state of disbelief and idolatry. The reference here is to the disbelievers of Quraysh. This can also be considered a threat from Allah to them because of their disbelief and idolatry; it is also said that this means: Allah will not forgo the torment you deserve for your acts of plotting, treachery and corruption'."
