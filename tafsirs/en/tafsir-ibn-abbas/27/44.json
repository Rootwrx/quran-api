  "text": "(It was said unto her: Enter the hall) enter the castle. (And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and bared her legs) she lifted her dress above her legs. ((Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass) beneath which there is water, so do not be afraid of getting wet. (She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself) by worshipping the sun, (and I surrender with Solomon) at the hand of Solomon (unto Allah, the Lord of the Worlds) the master of the jinn and human beings."
