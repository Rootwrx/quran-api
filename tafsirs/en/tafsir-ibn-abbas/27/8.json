This is the reading of Ubayy and 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud; it is also said that this means: blessed is He Who lightened this light; and it also said that this means: blessed is he who is seeking, i.e. Moses and whoever is around him of angels, (And glorified be Allah) He exonerated Himself, (the Lord of the Worlds!) the Master of the jinn and human beings."
