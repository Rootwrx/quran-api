  "text": "Solomon said: I want it even quicker than that. (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture) one who knew Allah's greatest name, O Living, O Subsistent, who was called Asaf Ibn Barkhiyya (said: I will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee) before that thing which you see from far reaches you. (And when he saw it set in his presence) i.e. when he saw her throne next to his, (Solomon said) to Asaf: (This is of the bounty of my Lord) this is of the favour of my Lord, (that He may try me whether I give thanks) for his blessings (or am ungrateful) or whether I abstain from being grateful for His blessings. (Whosoever giveth thanks) for Allah's blessings (he only giveth thanks for (the good of) his own soul) for the reward of his Lord: (and whosoever is ungrateful) for the blessing of His Lord, he harms only his soul. (For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence) of his gratitude, (Bountiful) He forgives whoever repents, and He does not hasten his punishment."
