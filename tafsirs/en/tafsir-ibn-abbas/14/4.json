(Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray) from His religion, (and guideth) to His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves to be guided. (He is the Mighty) in His kingdom and sovereignty; it is also said that this means: the Mighty in His retribution against those who do not believe, (the Wise) in His command and decree; it is also said that this means: the Wise in guiding some and misguiding others."
