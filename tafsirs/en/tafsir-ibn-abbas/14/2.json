(And woe) this refers to the hottest, narrowest and deepest valley in hell. This valley would cry: \ufffdO Lord! My heat is intense, my width is very narrow and my depth is so deep, so let me take revenge on those who disobeyed you and make that nothing takes revenge against me\ufffd, (unto the disbelievers from an awful doom) a severe torment."
