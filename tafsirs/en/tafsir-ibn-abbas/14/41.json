(Forgive me) my sins (and my parents) and forgive my believing forefathers (and believers) and forgive all believing men and women (on the day when the account is cast) when there is reckoning and both the good and evil deeds are displayed, such as those whose good deeds outweigh their evil deeds will enter Paradise and those whose evil works outweigh their good deeds will enter hell; while those whose good works equal their evil works will be among the people of the Heights."
