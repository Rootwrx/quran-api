  "text": "(And the similitude of a bad saying) associating partners with Allah (is as a bad tree) this refers to the idolater. He says: idolatry is blameworthy and no aspect of it is praiseworthy, just as the idolater is censored and there is nothing praiseworthy about him; it is also said that the bad tree refers to the colocynth which is bitter and useless, and so is the idolater: useless and censored, (uprooted from upon the earth, possessing no stability) it has no firmness on the face of the earth; and so is the idolater: he does not have any proof to cling to, just as the colocynth does not have roots which keep it firmly grounded. Moreover, while a person is an idolater none of his works are accepted."
