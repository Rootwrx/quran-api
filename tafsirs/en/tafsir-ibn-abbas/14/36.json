(Lo! they have led many of mankind astray) i.e. they were made to lead many people astray; it is also said that this means: many people went astray because of them. (But whoso followeth me) whoever follows my religion and obeys me, (he verily is of me) he follows my religion. (And whoso disobeyeth me) whoever opposes my religion, (still Thou art Forgiving) of whoever repent of among them, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant."
