  "text": "(Giving its fruit at every season) He says: the sincere believer performs goodness and acts of obedience to Allah at all times (by permission of its Lord?) He says: by command of its Lord; it is also said: the trait of a goodly saying insofar as its benefit and praise are concerned is like a goodly tree-the palm-tree-whose fruits are goodly. And the same goes for the believer. He says: the origin of the tree is firmly grounded in the soil by means of its roots, and so is the believer: he is firm by means of proof and argument. (Its branches reaching into heaven) He says: the branches of the palm-trees are raised towards the sky, and so are the works of the believer raised to heaven. (Giving its fruit at every season) He says: it yields fruits every six months by the will of its Lord, and so is the believer, he performs acts of goodness or obedience at all times. (Allah coineth the similitudes) thus Allah explains His divine Oneness by coining similes (for mankind in order that they may reflect) so that people may take heed and desire to profess His divine Oneness."
