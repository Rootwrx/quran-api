  "text": "(Their messengers said: Can there be doubt concerning Allah) can there be any doubt regarding the divine Oneness of Allah, (the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calleth you) to repent and profess monotheism (that He may forgive you your sins) which you committed in the time of ignorance (and reprieve you) without any punishment (unto an appointed term) to an ordained time, i.e. to the time of death. (They said) to the messengers: (Ye are but mortals) human beings (like us, who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship) of idols. (Then bring some clear warrant) an edict or proof."
