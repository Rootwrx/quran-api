  "text": "(We verily sent Moses with Our revelations) the nine signs: the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, blood and the drought and shortage of foodstuff, (saying: Bring your people forth) invite your people (from darkness unto light) to embrace faith and leave disbelief. (And remind them of the days of Allah) of the days when Allah sent His chastisement; it is also said that this means: remind them of the days of Allah's mercy. (Lo! Therein) in what I have mentioned (are revelations) signs (for each steadfast) in obedience, (thankful (heart)) for the blessings bestowed upon him."
