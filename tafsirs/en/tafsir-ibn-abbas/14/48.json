  "text": "(On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth) it will be changed to a state other than the actual state. Its changing will take place by adding to and subtracting from it, and its valleys and mountains will be levelled down; and it is also said that this means: the earth will be changed to other than what it is now, (and the heavens (also will be changed)) they will be folded up in His right Hand (and they will come forth unto Allah) they emerge and become manifest to (the One, the Almighty) Who conquers His created being by means of death."
