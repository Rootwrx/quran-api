(None save Allah knoweth them) none knows their numbers or their punishment save Allah. (Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs) they came to them with commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they thrust their hands into their mouths) He says: they rejected what the messengers brought to them; it is also said that this means: they thrust their hands into their mouths, as if saying: be quiet or we will silence you, (and said) to the messengers: (Lo! we disbelieve) we reject (in that wherewith ye have been sent) of Scripture and monotheism, (and lo! we are in grave doubt) in manifest doubt (concerning that to which ye call us) of Scripture and monotheism."
