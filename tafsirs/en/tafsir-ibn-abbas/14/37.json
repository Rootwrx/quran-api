I have settled some of my posterity) Ishmael and his mother Hagar (in an uncultivable valley) in a valley with no vegetation or crops (near unto Thy holy House) i.e. Mecca, (our Lord!) O our Lord! (that they may establish proper worship) so that they perform the prayer faced towards the Ka'bah; (so incline some hearts of men) the hearts of some men (that they may yearn towards them) long and head towards them every year, (and provide Thou them with fruits) with different kinds of fruit (in order that they may be thankful) so that they are grateful for your blessings."
