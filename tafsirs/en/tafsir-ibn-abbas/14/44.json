O our Lord! (Reprieve us for a little while) in the life of this world. (We will obey Your call) to monotheism (and will follow the messengers) we will obey the messengers. Allah will then say to them: (Did ye not swear before) before this, when you were in the life of the lower world (that there would be no end for you) in the life of the world and that there is no resurrection?"
