(Then those who were despised) the lowly among people (say unto those who were scornful) towards faith, i.e. the leaders: (We were unto you a following) we obeyed your commands, (can ye then avert from us) bear on behalf of us (aught of Allah's doom? They say) i.e. the leaders: (Had Allah guided us) to His religion, (we should have guided you) we would have invited you to His religion. (Whether we rage) for being tormented (or patiently endure) or keep silent (is (now) all one for us: we have no place of refuge) or helper."
