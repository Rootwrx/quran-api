Build for me a home with Thee in the Garden) so that Pharaoh's torture becomes bearable for me, (and deliver me from Pharaoh) from the religion of Pharaoh (and his work) and his torture, (and deliver me from evil doing folk) the disbelievers. Thus the disbelief of her husband did not harm her because of her faith and sincerity;"
