Strive against the disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca with the sword until they accept faith (and the hypocrites) of Medina with your tongue by rebuking and threatening them, (and be stern with them) and be hard in words and deeds with both parties. (Hell will be their home) the destination of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be the Fire, (a hapless journey's end) is Gehenna wherein they will end up."
