  "text": "(Lo! they who persecute) those who burn and torture with fire (believing men) men who are true in their faith (and believing women) who are true in their faith (and repent not) from their idolatry and disbelief, (theirs verily will be the doom of hell) in the Hereafter, (and theirs the doom of burning) in the Fire; and it is also said: in the life of the world, for Allah had burned them with the Fire. These were people from Najran, and it is said from Mosul, who tortured and consequently killed a group of believers with fire in attempt to make them renounce their religion. The name of the king of these people is Yusuf, and it is said his name is Dhu'l-Nuwas."
