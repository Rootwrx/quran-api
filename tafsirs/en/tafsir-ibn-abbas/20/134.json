O our Lord! (If only Thou hadst sent unto us) why did You not send us (a messenger, so that we might have followed Your revelations) so that we you follow your Messenger and believe in Your Book (before we were (thus) humbled) before we were killed at Badr (and disgraced!) and tormented by the torment of the Day of Judgement."
