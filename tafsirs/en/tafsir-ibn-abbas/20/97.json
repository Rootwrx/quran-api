(And lo! in this life) for as long as you live (it is for thee to say: Touch me not) you do not interact with anyone and no one will interact with you! (and lo! there is for you a tryst) you have an appointed time on the Day of Judgement (thou canst not break) you cannot miss. (Now look upon your god of which thou hast remained a votary) look at the god which you worshipped. (Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea)"
