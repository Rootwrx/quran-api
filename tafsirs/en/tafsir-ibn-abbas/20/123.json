(But if there come unto you from Me a guidance) when it comes to you, O Children of Adam, guidance from Me: a Scripture and a Messenger, (then whoso followeth My guidance) My Scripture and Messenger, (he will not go astray) by following them in the life of this world (nor come to grief) in the Hereafter."
