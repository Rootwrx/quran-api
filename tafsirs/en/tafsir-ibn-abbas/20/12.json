So take off thy shoes) for his shoes were made of the skin of a dead ass, (for Lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa) Tuwa is the name of the valley; it also said that Tuwa means: this valley has been crossed (tawathu) by prophets before you; it is also said that Tuwa is a well which was filled with stones (tuwiyyat bi'l-sakhr) in the valley where he found the tree."
