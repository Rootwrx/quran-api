  "text": "(Then they twain ate thereof) Adam and Eve ate from the tree, (so that their shame became apparent unto them) so that their nakedness appeared to them, (and they began) intentionally (to hide by heaping on themselves) by covering their nakedness with (some of the leaves of the Garden) some of the leaves of fig trees; whenever they put some on them, they fell off. (And Adam disobeyed his Lord) by eating from the tree, (so went astray) he left the way of guidance, and did not get what he wanted when he ate from the tree."
