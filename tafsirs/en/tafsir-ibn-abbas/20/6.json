  "text": "(Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them) of created beings and marvels, (and whatsoever is beneath the sod) that which is beneath the seven earths. This is because the seven earths are above water, and water is above the whale, the whale is above the rock and the rock is above the two horns of the bull and the bull is above the dust, and the dust is moist soil and none knows what is beneath it except Allah."
