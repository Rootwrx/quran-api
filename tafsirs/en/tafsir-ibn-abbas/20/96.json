  "text": "(He said) al-Samiri said: (I perceived what they perceive not) I saw what the children of Israel did not see. Moses asked him: and what did you see that they did not? He said: I saw Gabriel riding a female horse, Balqa', the beast of life, (so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger) from the dust upon which Gabriel's horse stepped on, (and then threw it in) and threw it in the calf's mouth and behind. (Thus my soul commended to me) thus did my soul entice me to do."
