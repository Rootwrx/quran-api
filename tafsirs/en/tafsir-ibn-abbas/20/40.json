(and We restored thee) We returned you to your mother (to your mother that her eyes might be refreshed) that she might be comforted (and might not sorrow) thinking that her son may have died upon throwing him in the river. (And thou didst kill a man) a Coptic man (and We delivered thee from great distress) from the distress caused to you by the people, (and tried thee with a heavy trial) We tried again and again. (And thou didst tarry years) ten years (among the folk of Midian. Then comest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses) then you came to face My decree, in that I spoke with you and sent you with a message to Pharaoh,"
