(Lo! he is) i.e. Moses (your chief) the most erudite of you (who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately) the right hand with the left leg, (and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment) me or the Lord of Moses and Aaron."
