Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise) a true promise? (Did the time appointed then appear too long for you) did I exceed the appointed time, (or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you) should become prescribed upon you, (that ye broke tryst with me) that you went against my promise?"
