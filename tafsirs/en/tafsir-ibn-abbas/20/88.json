  "text": "(Then he produced for them) from the gold they threw in the Fire, al-Samiri made for them (a calf, of saffron hue) a small form without a spirit, (which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried) what is this? And al-Samiri said: (This is your God and the God of Moses, but he hath forgotten) al-Samiri abandoned Allah's worship and command; it is also said that this means: Moses left the way and took a wrong turn."
