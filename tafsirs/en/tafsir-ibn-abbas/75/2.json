As for the righteous soul, it will say: if only I did more righteous works. And as for the sinful soul, it will say: if only I abstained from committing sins. Both souls will say this upon seeing the reward and punishment awaiting each one of them respectively. It is also said that the accusing soul in question is the soul that reproaches itself; and it is also said: it is the soul that repents of its sins and reproaches itself for what it had committed; and it is also said it is the sinful, disbelieving soul."
