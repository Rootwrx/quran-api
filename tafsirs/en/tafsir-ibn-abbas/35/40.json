Or have they any portion) with Allah (in the heavens) in the creation of the heavens? (Or have We given them) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (a Scripture so that they act on clear proof therefrom) that they will not be punished? (Nay, the evil-doers promise) what the idolaters say in the life of this world to (one another) i.e. the leaders to those who followed them (only to deceive) only vanity in the Hereafter."
