  "text": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said upon explaining Allah's words: (Praise be to Allah): '(Praise be to Allah) He says: gratitude and favour belong to Allah, (the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who appointeth the angels) Who created and honoured the angels and made them (messengers) i.e. He sends them with a message to His created beings; this refers to Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel, the angel of death, thunder and the Guardian angels (having wings) i.e. the angels have wings (two, three and four) wings with which to fly. (He multiplieth in creation) in the creation of angels (what He will) it is also said that in those wings are what He wills; and it is also said: whomever He wills is in good fortune; and it is said that this means: whomsoever He wills has a good voice. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) of increase and decrease."
