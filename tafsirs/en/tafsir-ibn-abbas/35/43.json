(Then, can they expect) can your people, once they disbelieved in you, expect (aught save the treatment of the folk of old) can they expect anything save the punishment of the people of old when they disbelieved in their messengers? (Thou wilt not find for Allah's way of treatment) for Allah's punishment (any substitute) any alteration, (nor wilt thou find for Allah's way of treatment aught of power to change) to someone other than Him."
