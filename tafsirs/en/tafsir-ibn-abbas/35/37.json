  "text": "(And they) i.e. the disbelievers (cry for help there) in the Fire, and implore and beseech, ((saying): Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Release us) from the Fire and return us to the life of the world, for we will believe in You; and (we will do right) sincerely believing in You, (not (the wrong) that we used to do) in our state of idolatry. Allah will say to them: (Did not We grant you a life) did We not give you, O group of disbelievers, in the life of the world a respite (long enough for who reflected to reflect) long enough for reflection (therein) for anyone who wanted to reflect? (And the warner) Muhammad (pbuh) (came unto you) with the Qur'an and warned you against this day, but you did not believe him. (Now taste (the flavour of your deeds)) taste the torment of the Fire, (for evil-doers) the disbelievers (have no helper) to save them from Allah's chastisement."
