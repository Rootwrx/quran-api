  "text": "(Then) after We sent Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad (pbuh) (We gave the Scripture as inheritance) We gave the honour of memorising, writing and reciting the Qur'an (unto those whom We elected of our bondmen) by means of faith, i.e. the community of Muhammad (pbuh). (But of them are some who wrong themselves) through committing enormities, and these will not be saved unless there is intercession in their favour, or unless they are forgiven or when Allah's promise is fulfilled (and of them are some who are lukewarm) some of them did good works and evil works in equal measure; these will be slightly taken to task and then be saved, (and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds) in the life of this world and among those brought near to the Garden of Eden in the Hereafter, (by Allah's leave) by Allah's given success and beneficence. (That) selection and outstripping (is the great favour) the greatest grace that Allah can bestow upon them!"
