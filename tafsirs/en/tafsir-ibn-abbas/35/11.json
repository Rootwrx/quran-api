  "text": "(Allah created you from dust) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then from a little fluid) the sperm drops of your fathers, (then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth) a child (or bringeth forth) gives birth after the full period of pregnancy or prematurely (save with His knowledge) save with the knowledge and command of Allah. (And no one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book) except that it is recorded in the Guarded Tablet. (Lo! That) recording that (is easy for Allah) even without writing."
