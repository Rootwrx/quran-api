(Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray) He sends away from His religion whoever deserves it, (and guideth) to His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (so let not thy soul expire) do not kill yourself with grief (in sighings for them) in remorse about their destruction, if they reject faith. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) in their state of disbelief of scheming in Dar al-Nadwah and treachery in order to kill Muhammad (pbuh)!"
