And from them both) the sweet and salty seas (ye eat fresh meat) fresh fish (and derive) especially from the salty sea (the ornament) gems and pearls (that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them) i.e. the seas (with its prow) coming and going driven by the same wind (that ye may seek of His bounty) of His provision, (and that haply ye may give thanks) so that you may give thanks for His bounty."
