(Thou warnest only) your warning, O Muhammad, benefits only (those who fear their Lord in secret) those who work for their Lord even though He is invisible to them, but nothing is invisible to Him, (and have established worship) and perform the five daily prayers. (He who groweth (in goodness)) he who believes in Allah's divine Oneness, does good works and spends of his wealth in charity, (groweth only for himself) the reward of all this goes to his own soul. (Unto Allah is the journeying) unto Allah is the return in the Hereafter."
