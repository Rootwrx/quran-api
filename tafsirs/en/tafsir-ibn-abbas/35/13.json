(He hath subdued the sun and moon to service) He subdued the light of the sun and the moon to the service of human beings. (Each runneth unto an appointed term) round appointed trajectories. (Such is Allah, your Lord) it is Allah, your Lord, Who does so, not the deities; (His is the Sovereignty) the storehouses of the universe; (and those unto whom you pray) those whom you worship (instead of Him) instead of Allah (own not so much as the white spot on a date stone) they are unable to own of all that even the white spot on a date stone."
