We warn you) O people of Mecca (of a doom at hand) which will surely happen, (a day whereon a man will look) when the believer will look; and it is also said: when the disbeliever will look (on that which his own hands have sent before) have earned of good or evil, (and the disbeliever will cry: \ufffdWould that I were dust!\ufffd) with the beasts. Because of the horrors, severity and torment of that day, the disbeliever will wish to be turned into dust along with beasts. This will occur on the day when the first trumpet resounds'."
