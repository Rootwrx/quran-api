The East of winter and the East of summer have 180 phases just as the two Wests and the moon have 180 phases. It is also said that the Easts of summer and winter have 177 phases and the Wests of summer and winter as well as the moon have 177 phases. The sun rises throughout the year two days in the same phase and it also sets two days in the same phase."
