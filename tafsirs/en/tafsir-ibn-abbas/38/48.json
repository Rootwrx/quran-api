  "text": "(And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha) the cousin of Ilyas (and Dhu'l-Kifl) who appointed himself as a guarantor of a few things which belonged to some people and kept his word; it is also said that he took charge of 100 prophets and he fed them until Allah saved them from death. However, he was a righteous man and not a prophet. (All are of the chosen) in Allah's sight."
