  "text": "((David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe) in taking your ewe (in addition to his ewes) even though he has many ewes, (and lo! many partners) and brothers (oppress one another) transgress against one another, (save such as believe) in Allah (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (and they are few) those who do not transgress. And the two went out from whence they came. (And David guessed) he knew and was certain (that We had tried him) because of the sin he committed, (and he sought forgiveness of his Lord) from his sin, (and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented) feeling remorse for what he did."
