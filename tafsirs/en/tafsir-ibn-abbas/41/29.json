(Show us these who beguiled us) those who misguided us from the Truth and guidance (of the jinn and humankind) from the jinn Satan, and from humankind Cain who killed his brother Abel; and it is also said: from the jinn Iblis, and from the humans their leaders. (We will place them beneath our feet) to punish them (that they may be among the nethermost) that they may be among those who suffer the chastisement most."
