It is inspired in me) Gabriel was sent to me with the Qur'an to convey to you (that your God is One God) He has no son or partner, (therefore take the straight path unto Him) therefore turn to Him with repentance from idolatry (and seek forgiveness of Him) and declare His divine Oneness. (And woe) severe punishment; it is also said this means: a river of puss and blood in Gehenna (unto the idolaters) Abu Jahl and his host,"
