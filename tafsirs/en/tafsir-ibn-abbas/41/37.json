  "text": "(And of His portents) and of the signs of His divine Oneness and power (are the night and the day and the sun and the moon) all these are signs from Allah. (Adore not the sun) worship not the sun (nor the moon; but adore Allah) but worship Allah (Who created them) i.e. He created the sun, the moon, the day and the night, (if it is in truth Him whom ye worship) if you wish to worship Allah, then do not worship the sun and the moon, for you should worship the One Who created them; it is also said that this means: if, by worshipping the sun and the moon, you intend to worship Allah, then do not worship them, for the worship of Allah lies in not worshipping them."
