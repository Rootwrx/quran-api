He says: who is better in inviting people than he who calls to Allah through the call to prayer and then does right, i.e. performs two units of prayer after the call to prayer, except for the call to prayer of Maghrib, (and saith: Lo! I am of those who surrender (unto Him)) I adhere to the religion of Islam and says: I believe truly. The reference here is to Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions."
