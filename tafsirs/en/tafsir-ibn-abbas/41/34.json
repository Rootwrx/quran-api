(Repel) O Muhammad, lest he tries, (the evil deed) idolatry from Abu Jahl (with one which is better) with \" there is no deity save Allah \" ; it is also said that this means: repel evil from Abu Jahl with that which is better, i.e. with good words, greetings and kindness, if you do that (then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity) regarding religion, i.e. Abu Jahl ((will become) as though he was a bosom friend) as though he is of the same religion or a close relative."
