What! A foreign tongue and an Arab) what, a Scripture in a foreign language brought by an Arab man? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (For those who believe) Abu Bakr and his fellow Muslims (it) i.e. the Qur'an (is a guidance) from error (and a healing) it removes the blindness which is in the hearts of people; (and as for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (there is a deafness in their ears, and it) i.e. the Qur'an (is blindness for them) a proof against them. (Such) the people of Mecca: Abu Jahl and his host (are called to from afar) it is as if they are called to believe in Allah's divine Oneness from high, above the sky."
