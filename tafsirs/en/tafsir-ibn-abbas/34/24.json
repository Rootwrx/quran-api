If they answer you that it is Allah, then it is fine; if not, (Say: Allah) gives you provision. (Lo! we or you) O people of Mecca (assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest) regarding Allah's provision; it is also said that this means: we are, group of believers, following the guidance, while you, O people of Mecca, in manifest disbelief and error."
