Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Nay, by my Lord) Allah swore by Himself, (but it is coming) the Hour is coming (unto you surely. (He is) the Knower of the Unseen) He knows what is hidden from people. (Not an atom's weight) not even a small red ant, (or less than that or greater, escapes Him) is hidden from Allah (in the heavens or in the earth) as regard the works of the servants, (but it is in a clear Record) in the Guarded Tablet well preserved,"
