  "text": "(No intercession availeth) the angels will not intercede (with Him) on the Day of Judgement (save for him whom He permitteth) to intercede. Allah then mentions the weakness of the angels, for when the angels heard Allah uttering the revelation to Gabriel in order to take it to Muhammad (pbuh) they passed out due to the awe they sensed from Allah's speech. And they remained in this state. (Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts) and Gabriel came down to them, and they lifted their heads, (they say) the angels said to Gabriel and the angels who were with him: (What was it that your Lord said) O Gabriel? (They say) Gabriel and the angels with him say: (The Truth) the Qur'an. (And He is the Sublime) more sublime than anyone and anything, (the Great) greater than everyone and everything."
