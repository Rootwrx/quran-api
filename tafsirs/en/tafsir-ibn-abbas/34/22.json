This is because the Banu Malih worshipped the jinn, thinking they were angels. Allah said to them: (They possess not) they cannot benefit you (an atom's weight either in the heavens or the earth, nor have they) the angels (any share) partnership with Allah (either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them) nor has He a helper among the angels who helped Him to create the heavens and the earth."
