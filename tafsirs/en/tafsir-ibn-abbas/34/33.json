And they are filled with remorse) both the leaders and those who obeyed them (when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. He says: their hands were tied to their necks. (Are they requited) on the Day of Judgement (aught save what they did) and said in their state of disbelief?"
