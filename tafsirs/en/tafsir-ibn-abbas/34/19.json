(But they said: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Make the stage between our journeys longer. And they wronged themselves) by means of disbelief and idolatry and failed to give thanks for those bounties, (therefore We made them bywords (in the land)) for people who came after them (and scattered them abroad) in different lands, (a total scattering) and We destroyed them completely. (Lo! Herein) in what We have done to them (verily are portents) signs and lessons (for each steadfast) in obedience, (grateful (heart)) for the bounties of Allah."
