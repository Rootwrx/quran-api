  "text": "(But they were froward) they turned away from faith and acceptance of the messengers and failed to give thanks, (so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram) the flood of a river which destroyed their gardens, houses and all their bounties. 'Iram was the name of a river in Yemen within which they built a dam. This dam had three superimposed openings, Allah destroyed the dam and destroyed them by means of its water, (and in exchange for their two gardens) which were destroyed (gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the tamarisk and here and there a lote tree."
