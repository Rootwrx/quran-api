(And such of them as deviated from) as disobey or rebel against (Our command) with which We commanded them; it is also said that this means: the command of Solomon, (them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming fire) it is also said that an angel hit with a pillar of fire whoever disobeyed among the jinn."
