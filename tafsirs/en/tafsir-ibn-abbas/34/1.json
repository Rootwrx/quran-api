  "text": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (Praise be to Allah): '(Praise be to Allah) He says: Gratitude belongs to Allah; this is because He is kind to His creation and the latter thanks Him for it, (unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens) of creation (and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings. (His is the praise) the favour (in the Hereafter) upon the dwellers of Paradise in Paradise, (and He is the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped save Him, (the Aware) He knows His created beings as well as their works."
