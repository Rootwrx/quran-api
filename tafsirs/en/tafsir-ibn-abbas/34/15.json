  "text": "(There was indeed a sign for Sheba) for the inhabitants of Sheba, which is a township in Yemen (in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on the right hand) of the road (and the left) of the road. There were about 13 townships in the direction of Yemen. Allah sent them 13 prophets, who said to them: (Eat of the provision of your Lord) eat from the bounty and blessing of your Lord (and render thanks to Him) by declaring your belief in His divine Oneness. (A fair land) this is a good township which is not swampy (and an indulgent Lord) for he who believes in Him and repents!"
