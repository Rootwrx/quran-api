They) i.e. the prophets; and it is also said that they refer to Zachariah and John (used to vie one with the other in good deeds) they used to hasten to acts of obedience (and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear) they used to pray to us out of longing and fear; it is also said that this means: they used to worship Us out of longing for Paradise and fear from hell, (and were submissive unto Us) and they were humble and obedient."
