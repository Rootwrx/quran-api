(The wrong-doers) these are the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host; they say to one another: (say: Is this) they mean Muhammad (pbuh) (other than a mortal like you) other than a human being like you? (Will ye then succumb to magic) will you then believe in magic and lies (when ye see (it)) while knowing that it is magic and lies?"
