(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Bring your proof (of their godhead)) bring your proofs for the validity of their worship. (This) i.e. the Qur'an (is the Reminder of those with me) is the events of those with me (and those before me) and the events of those who were before among the believers and disbelievers, and it does not contain that Allah has children or partners, (but most of them) all of them (know not the Truth) nor believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and so they are averse) they disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."
