Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him) they denied that messenger; (so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster)) with chastisement (and We made them bywords) We made them the talk of their time. (A far removal) what a disappointment for failing to obtain Allah's mercy (for folk who believe not!) for people who disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh)."
