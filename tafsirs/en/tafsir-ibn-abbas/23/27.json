  "text": "(Then We inspired in him) We sent Gabriel to him, (saying: Make the ship) saying: start building a ship (under Our eyes) under Our gaze (and Our inspiration) and through that which We inspired you. (Then, when Our command) Our punishment (cometh and the oven gusheth water) and the water gushes out of the oven (al-Tannur); it is also said that this means: when dawn breaks, (introduce therein) transport in the ship (of every (kind) two spouses) of every kind: a male and a female, (and thy household) and take those of your household who believe in you (save him thereof against whom the Word) that they will be chastised (hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me) by means of supplications (on behalf of those who have done wrong) i.e. to save those who disbelieved among your people: (Lo! they will be drowned) in the flood."
