  "text": "Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden) the chamber of the Beneficent, the source of the prophets and those near to Him (beneath which) beneath whose trees, habitations and rooms (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk, (wherein they dwell forever) they remain in Paradise for ever never to die or leave it. (Allah hath pleasure in them) i.e. in their faith and works (and they have pleasure in Him) in His reward and bestowal of honour upon Him. (This) i.e. the Gardens and good pleasure (is (in store) for him who feareth his Lord) is for him who believes in Allah's divine Oneness such as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his companions and 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers'."
