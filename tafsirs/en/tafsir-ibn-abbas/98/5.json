  "text": "(And they are ordered) in all the Scriptures (naught else than to serve Allah) nothing else but to profess Allah's divine Oneness, (keeping religion pure for Him) through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (as men by nature upright) as ones surrendered unto Him, (and to establish worship) and perform the five daily prayers after declaring their profession in Allah's divine Oneness (and to pay the poor-due) from their wealth after that. Allah then mentioned belief in Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (That) i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness (is true religion) the religion of truth, straight without any crookedness; it is also said that this means: that, i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness, is the religion of the angels; and it is also said this means: it is the religion of those who are by nature upright; and it is also said this means: the religion of Abraham."
