(They were more numerous than these) than the people of Mecca, (and mightier in power) in physical strength (and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth) they were keener on the life of this world and travelled more than them in seeking it. (But all that they used to earn) and say and do upon following their religions (availed them not) from Allah's punishment."
