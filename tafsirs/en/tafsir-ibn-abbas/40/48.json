(Lo! Allah hath judged between (His) slaves) He has judged between the worshipper and the worshipped and between the leaders and followers and decreed that they will abide in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has judged between the believers and disbelievers: the believers will enter the Garden while the disbelievers will go to the Fire."
