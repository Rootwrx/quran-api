So pray unto Him) so profess His divine Oneness, (making religion pure for Him (only)) making your worship and profession of Allah's divine Oneness sincere to Him. (Praise be to Allah) gratitude and lordship belong to Allah, (the Lord of the Worlds) the Lord of all that which has a spirit and moves on the face of the earth!"
