  "text": "(Lo! those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah) those who disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, i.e. the Jews; they also argued with the Prophet (pbuh) about the anti-Christ, his greatness and the return of their kingdom upon the coming of the anti-Christ (without a warrant) proof (having come unto them) from Allah for what they claimed, (there is naught else in their breasts) in their hearts (save pride) they were too proud to accept the Truth (which they will never attain) they will never attain the pride which is in their hearts nor will they have their kingdom back upon the coming of the anti-Christ. (So take thou refuge in Allah) O Muhammad, from the sedition of the anti-Christ. (Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer) of what the Jews say, (the Seer) He sees them and sees their works just as He sees the anti-Christ and his coming."
