  "text": "(Allah it is Who appointed) created (for you the earth for a dwelling-place) for both the living and the dead (and the sky for a canopy) a raised canopy, (and fashioned you) in wombs (and perfected your shapes) He made your shapes better than the shapes of beasts, (and hath provided you with good things) He made your provision better and softer than the provision of beasts; it is also said this means: He provided you with lawful provision. (Such is Allah, your Lord) the one who did all this is your Lord, therefore give thanks to Him. (Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds) the Lord of all that has a spirit and moves on the face of the earth!"
