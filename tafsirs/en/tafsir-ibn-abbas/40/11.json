(Twice hast Thou made us die) once when You took away our souls [in the life of the world] and once after Munkar and Nakir questioned us in the graves, (and twice hast Thou made us live) once before we were questioned by Munkar and Nakir in the graves and once for the resurrection. (Now we confess) we acknowledge (our sins) our idolatry and denial. (Is there any way to go out) is there any way we can go back to the life of the world so that we believe in You?"
