(They say: Yea, verily) they conveyed the message to us, (They say) the angels of hell will say to them in mockery: (Then do ye pray, although the prayer of disbelievers) in the Fire (is in vain) it is also said that this means: although the worship of the disbelievers in the life of the world is but in error."
