  "text": "(But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom) which came to destroy them, for faith upon the advent of Allah's punishment is of no value; but it is also said that such faith avails the person who declares it, just as repentance in such a moment benefits. (This is Allah's law) this is Allah's wont (which hath ever taken course for his bondsmen) that He sends His punishment upon them whenever they disbelieve, and rejects faith and repentance upon the advent of His punishment. (And then the disbelievers) in Allah (will be ruined) when the punishment visits them'."
