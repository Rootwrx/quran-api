  "text": "(And a believing man) Ezekiel (of Pharaoh's family) who was Pharaoh's cousin, (who hid his faith) from Pharaoh and his folk; it is also said that this means: a believing man, Ezekiel, who hid his faith from Pharaoh's family (said: Would ye kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah) and He has sent me to you, (and hath brought you clear proofs) commands, prohibitions and signs of his prophethood (from your Lord? If he is lying) in what he says, (then his lie is upon him) the punishment of his lying is to his own hurt; (and if he is truthful) in what he says and you still disbelieve in him (then some of that wherewith he threatens you) of punishment (will strike you) in the life of this world. (Lo! Allah guideth not) Allah leads not to His religion (one who is a prodigal) an idolater, (a liar) against Allah."
