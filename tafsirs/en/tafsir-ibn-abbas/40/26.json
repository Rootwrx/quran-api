I fear that he will alter your religion) you presently practise (or that he will cause confusion in the land) or that he will kill your sons and use your daughters as servants, as you did yourself with his people; it is also said that this means: or they will cause confusion in the land by leaving your religion and the religion of your forefathers and accepting his religion."
