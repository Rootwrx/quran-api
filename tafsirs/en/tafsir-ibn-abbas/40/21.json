They were mightier than these in power) in physical strength (and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth) they were more keen to possess the life of this world and to travel much farther in its pursuit. (Yet Allah sewed them for their sins) yet Allah punished them because of their sins and disbelief, (and they had no protector from Allah) from Allah's punishment."
