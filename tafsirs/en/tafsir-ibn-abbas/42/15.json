(And be thou upright) in your profession of Allah's divine Oneness (as thou art commanded) in the Qur'an, (and follow not their lusts) and follow not the Qiblah and religion of the Jews, (but say: I believe in whatever Scripture Allah hath sent down) of Scriptures to the prophets, (and I am commanded) in the Qur'an (to be just among you) through faith in Allah's divine Oneness. (Allah is our Lord and your Lord) He will judge between us on the Day of Judgement. (Unto us our works) unto us is the worship of Allah and the religion of Islam (and unto you your works) and against you is the worship of idols and Satan's religion; (no argument between us and you) regarding religion. (Allah will bring us together) on the Day of Judgement, (and unto Him is the journeying) and unto Him is the destination of both believers and disbelievers."
