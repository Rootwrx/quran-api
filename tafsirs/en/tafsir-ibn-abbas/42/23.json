(Say) O Muhammad, to your Companions; and it is said: to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no fee) no payment (therefore, save loving kindness among kinsfolk) except that you treat kindly my kinsfolk after me; it is also said this means: except that you draw closer to Allah through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, according to al-Hasan al-Basri; and according to al-Farra' this means: draw closer to Allah by means of repentance. (And whoso scoreth a good deed we add unto its good for him) nine times. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the one who repents, (Responsive) He is thankful for very little and rewards for it abundantly."
