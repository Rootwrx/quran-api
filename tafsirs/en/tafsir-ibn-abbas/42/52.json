(Thou knewest not what the Scripture was) you did not know what the Qur'an was before the coming of Gabriel to you nor did you know how to recite the Qur'an before it came to you, (nor what the Faith) nor did you know the call to Allah's divine Oneness. (But We have made it) i.e. the Qur'an (a light) an exposition of commands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful, the Truth and falsehood (whereby) by means of the Qur'an (We guide whom We will) whoever deserves it (of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost guide) do call (unto a right path) a straight, true religion."
