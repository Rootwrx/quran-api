He hath made for you pairs) males and females (of yourselves) a human being like yourselves, (and of the cattle also pairs) males and females, (whereby He multiplieth you) He creates you in the wombs; it is also said that this means: He multiplies you through marriage. (Naught is as His likeness) in attribute, knowledge, power and providence; (and He is the Hearer) of what you say, (the Seer) of your works."
