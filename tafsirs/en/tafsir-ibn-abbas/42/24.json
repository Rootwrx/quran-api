The Prophet (pbuh) was saddened because of this, and so Allah, glorious and Exalted is He, said: (If Allah willed, He could have sealed) tied (thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie) Allah will destroy idolatry and all the idolaters (and will vindicate the Truth by His words) and will manifest the religion of Islam through His enhancement. (Lo! He is aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men)) He knows what is in people's hearts whether it is good or evil."
