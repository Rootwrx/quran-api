(And Whoso desireth the harvest of the world) and whoever desires the reward of the life of the world through the works that Allah has made obligatory upon him, (We give him thereof) We give him of the life of the world and drive away from him some of its hardship, (and he hath no portion) he has no reward (in the Hereafter) in Paradise because he did not work for Allah."
