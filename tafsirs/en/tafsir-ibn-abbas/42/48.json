After this, Allah commanded them to fight. (And lo! when We cause man) the disbelieving person (to taste of mercy) to taste a blessing (from Us he exulteth therefore) without giving thanks for it. (And if some evil) hardship, poverty or misfortune (striketh them because of that which their own hands have sent before) because of what they did in their state of idolatry, (then lo! Man) Abu Jahl (is an ingrate) he disbelieves in Allah and does not give thanks for His blessings."
