(Dreadful for the idolaters) Abu Jahl and his host (is that unto which thou callest them) of Allah's divine Oneness and the Qur'an. (Allah chooseth for Himself) for His religion (whom He will) this he who is born a Muslim and dies as a Muslim, (and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (towards Him)) and guides to His religion whoever turns to Him of the disbelievers."
