(Observe your duty to your Lord) obey your Lord in small and great things. (For those who do good) for those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness (in this world there is good) they will have the Garden on the Day of Judgement, (and Allah's earth) the land of Medina (is spacious) is safe from the enemy, so travel to it; this address was before the Hijrah. (Verily the steadfast) in the face of misfortunes (will be paid their wages) their rewards (without stint) without measure or delay."
