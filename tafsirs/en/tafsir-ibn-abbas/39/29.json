  "text": "(Allah coineth a similitude: A man in relation to whom are several part owners, quarrelling) one ordering him to do something while the other forbidding him from doing the same; such is the similitude of a man who worships several deities, (and a man belonging wholly to one man) this is like the believer who worships only Allah and surrenders his religion and works to Allah alone. (Are the two equal in similitude) are the disbeliever and believer equal? (Praise be to Allah) divine Oneness and praise belong to Allah! (But most of them know not) the similitudes of the Qur'an."
