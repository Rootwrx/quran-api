(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The losers will be those who lose themselves) by missing both the life of this world and the Hereafter (and their housefolk) and servants and houses in the Garden (on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the manifest loss) losing the life of this world and the Hereafter is the manifest loss!"
