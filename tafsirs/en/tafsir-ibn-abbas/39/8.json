  "text": "(And when some hurt) hardship and trial (toucheth man) the disbelieving man, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (he crieth unto his Lord) to lift away the hardship and trial, (turning unto Him) with prayers. (Then, when He grants him) then, when He changes into (a boon from Him he forgeteth that for which he cried unto Him before) before the blessing, (and setteth up rivals) and equals (to Allah that he may beguile (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Say) to Abu Jahl: (Take pleasure in thy disbelief) dwell in your disbelief (a while) a little in the life of this world. (Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire) you are of the inhabitants of the Fire."
