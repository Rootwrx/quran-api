(Then woe) then severe punishment; it is also said: then a valley of puss and blood in Gehenna (unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah) unto those whose hearts are not softened by the remembrance of Allah; the reference here is to Abu Jahl and his host. (Such) those who have such traits (are in plain error) in manifest disbelief."
