(He maketh night to succeed day) He reduces the night such that the day is longer than the night, (and He maketh day to succeed night) and prolongs the night such that the night is longer than the day, (and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service) and He makes the sun and moon subservient to the Children of Adam, (each) i.e. the sun and the moon, the day and night (running on for an appointed term) for an appointed time. (Is not He the Mighty) He Who does this is the Mighty in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Forgiver) of those who believe in Him?"
