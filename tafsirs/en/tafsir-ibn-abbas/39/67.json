  "text": "(And they esteem not Allah as He hath the right to be esteemed) they do not magnify Allah as He should be magnified when they say: \ufffdAllah's Hands are tight\ufffd, \ufffdAllah is poor and is requesting a loan from us\ufffd, the latter being what the Jew Malik Ibn al-Sayf, may Allah forsake him, said, (when the whole earth is His handful) when the whole earth is in His possession (on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens are rolled in His right hand) and the heavens are rolled by His power on the Day of Resurrection. Knowing that both Hands of Allah, Exalted is He, are right. (Glorified is He) Allah exonerated Himself from the claim of the Jews (and High Exalted) He is free and far elevated (from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)) of partners."
