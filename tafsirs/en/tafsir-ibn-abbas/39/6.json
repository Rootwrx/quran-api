  "text": "(He created you from one being) from the being of Adam alone, (then from that (being)) i.e. from Adam (He made its mate) Eve, He created her from one of Adam's shorter ribs; (and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds) of sheep: a male and a female; of goat: a male and a female; of camel: a male and a female; of bovines: a male and a female. (He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation) a state after another: a sperm drop then a blood clot then a piece of flesh and then bones, (in a threefold gloom) the darkness of the belly, the darkness of the womb and the darkness of the placenta. (Such is Allah, your Lord) Who does this. (His is the Sovereignty) which is perpetual and never ending. (There is no God save Him) there is no Creator or Fashioner except Him. (How then are ye turned away) How then do you lie against Him and ascribe partners to Him?"
