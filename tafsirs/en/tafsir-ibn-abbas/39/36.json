(Yet they would frighten thee) O Muhammad (with those beside Him) i.e. with al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat; they say to you: do not vilify them or curse them lets they bewitch you. (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no guide) to lead him to Allah's religion; the reference here is to Abu Jahl and his host."
