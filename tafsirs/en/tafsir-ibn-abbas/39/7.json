  "text": "(If ye are thankless) if you disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, O people of Mecca, (yet Allah is Independent of you) Allah is not in need of your faith, (though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen) though He is not pleased with disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, because disbelief is not His religion; (and if ye are thankful) if you believe (He is pleased therewith for you) He will accept it from you because that is His religion. (No laden soul will bear another's load) no soul will bear the sins of another; it is also said that this means: no soul will be taken to task for the sins of another soul, for each soul will be taken to task for its own sins; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be punished for no crime. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after death; (and He will tell you) on the Day of Judgement (what ye used to do) and say in the life of this world. (Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men)) of good and evil."
