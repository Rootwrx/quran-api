We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture) We have sent you Gabriel with the Scripture (for mankind with truth) He says: in order to explain the Truth and falsehood to people. (Then whosoever goeth right) by means of the Qur'an and believes in it (it is for his soul) the reward of it, (and whosoever strayeth) and whoever disbelieves in the Qur'an, (strayeth only to its hurt) the punishment of his denial will be inflicted on his soul. (And thou art not a warder) a custodian (over them) over the disbelievers of Mecca such that you are taken to task for their denial."
