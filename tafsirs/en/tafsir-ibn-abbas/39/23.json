  "text": "(Allah hath (now) revealed the fairest of statements) the best speech, i.e. the Qur'an, (a Scripture consistent) the verses of promise, mercy, victory and forgiveness are consistent with each others, and the verses of threat, chastisement, rebuke and warning are consistent with each other, wherein the mention of mercy and chastisement, promises and threats, the abrogating and abrogated, etc., are (paired), it is also said that this means: they are repeated, (whereat) from the verses of chastisement and threats (doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh) soften through the verses of mercy (and their hearts soften) and their hearts return (to Allah's reminder) i.e. the Qur'an. (Such) i.e. the Qur'an (is Allah's guidance) is the clarification of Allah, (wherewith He guideth whom He will) to His religion. (And him whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no guide) to lead him to Allah's religion."
