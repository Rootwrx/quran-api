(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah) al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat, (if Allah willed some hurt) hardship or trial (for me, could they) i.e. al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (remove from me His hurt) His hardship and trial; (or if He willed some mercy) well-being (for me, could they) i.e. al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (restrain His mercy) from me, such that you ask me to worship them? (Say) O Muhammad: (Allah is my all) I trust in Allah. (In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust) it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trust in Allah."
