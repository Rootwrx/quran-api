And those who choose) and those who worship (protecting friends) deities: al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (beside Him) beside Allah, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca ((say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah) near to Allah in rank and intercession. (Lo! Allah will judge between them) and the believers on the Day of Judgement (concerning that wherein) in the matter of religion (they differ) they contravene. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to his religion (him who is a liar) about Allah, (an ingrate) and disbelieves in Allah; the reference here is to the Jews, Christians, the Banu Malih, the Magians and the Arab idolaters."
