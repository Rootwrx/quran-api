He boasted to 'Ali or to another believer who took part in the battle of Badr, saying: \ufffdwe give water to the pilgrims and tend to the Sacred House, and do this and that, etc.\ufffd, so Allah, Exalted is He, said: (Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst) did you say that giving water to the pilgrim (and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship as (equal to the worth of him) who believeth in Allah) is like the faith of he who believes in Allah, i.e. the believer who took part in the battle of Badr (and the Last Day) and believes in resurrection after death, (and striveth in the way of Allah) and strives in obedience of Allah on the Day of Badr? (They are not equal in the sight of Allah) as far as obedience and reward are concerned. (Allah guideth not) leads not to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, those who do not deserve it."
