The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Maghfal Ibn Yasar al-Muzani, Salim Ibn 'Umayr al-Ansari and their fellow Companions, (thou didst tell) them: (I cannot find) provision (whereon to mount you) for jihad. (They turned back) they left you (with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend) for jihad."
