(Yet will they swear by Allah) to you when you come back from the Battle of Tabuk, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Abi Wajd Ibn Qays, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and their companions who did not take part in the battle of Tabuk ((saying): If we had been able) to acquire provision and mount (we would surely have set out with you) to the Battle of Tabuk. (They destroy their souls) by lying in their oaths, (and Allah knoweth that they verily are liars) because they were able to set out with the Prophet (pbuh)."
