(So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship) for pilgrimage and circumambulation (after this their year) the year of freedom from obligation (bara'ah) after the day of immolation. (If ye fear poverty) impoverishment and neediness (Allah shall preserve you of His bounty) of His provision in another way (if He will) when He wills and will make you dispense with trading with Bakr Ibn Wa'il. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of your sustenance, (Wise) in that which He has ordained for you."
