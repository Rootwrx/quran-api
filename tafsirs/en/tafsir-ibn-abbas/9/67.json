  "text": "(The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another) they follow inwardly each other's religion. (They enjoin the wrong) disbelief and opposition of the Messenger, (and they forbid the right) faith and compliance with the Messenger, (and they withhold their hands) from spending in works of goodness. (They forget Allah) they have left Allah's obedience inwardly, (so He hath forgotten them) He has forsaken them in the life of this world and left them in the Hereafter in hell. (Lo! the hypocrites, they are the transgressors) the disbelievers inwardly."
