  "text": "(Lo! the number of the months with Allah) he says: the year is counted by months, i.e. the months of the year in which the poor-due is paid (is twelve months by Allah's ordinance) in the Guarded Tablet (in the day) from the day (that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them) four of these months (are sacred): Rajab, Dhu'l-Qa'dah, Dhu'l-Hijjah and Muharram: (that is the right religion) that is the right calculation: it neither increases or decreases. (So wrong not) harm not (yourselves) through transgression (in them) in those months; it is also said: in the sacred months. (And wage war on all the idolaters) in the sacred months and in other months (as they are waging war on all of you) all together. (And know) O believers (that Allah is with those who keep their duty (unto Him)) with those who ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, the breaking of treaties and fighting during the sacred months."
