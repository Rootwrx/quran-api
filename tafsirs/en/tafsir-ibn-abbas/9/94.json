(Say) O Muhammad, to them: (Make no excuse) for staying behind, (for we shall not believe you) we will not believe your excuses. (Allah hath told us tidings of you) of your secrets and hypocrisy. (Allah and His messenger will see your conduct) after this, if you repent, (and then ye will be brought back) in the Hereafter (unto Him Who knoweth the invisible) Who knows that which is hidden from His servants; it is also said that the invisible is that which the servants do not know; it is also said that this means: that which will happen (as well as the visible) that which the servants do know; it is also said that this means: that which has already happened, (and He will tell you what ye used to do) and say whether it is good or bad."
