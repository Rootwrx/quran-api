(They mixed a righteous action) they went forth with the Prophet (pbuh) once (with another that was bad) and stayed behind once. (It may be) 'may be' ['asa] when used in connection with Allah denotes a requisite (that Allah will relent towards them) forgive them. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) towards those who repent among them, (Merciful) towards he who dies in a state of repentance."
