  "text": "(They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong)) Jallas Ibn Suwayd swore by Allah that he did not say what 'Amir Ibn Qays said he did, (yet they did say the word of disbelief) the word of the disbelievers because when the Prophet (pbuh) mentioned the defects of the hypocrites and their inward illnesses, Jallas Ibn Suwayd said: \ufffdby Allah, if Muhammad is true in what he says about our brothers, we are worse than asses\ufffd. When 'Amir Ibn Qays informed the Prophet (pbuh) Jallas swore by Allah that he did not say this. But Allah gave him the lie and said (yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain) they wanted to expel and kill the Messenger without success, (and they sought revenge) they could not find anything wrong with the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty) through the spoils of war. (If they repent) from disbelief and hypocrisy (it will be better for them) than disbelief and hypocrisy; (and if they turn away) from repentance, (Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend) who will protect them (nor helper in the earth) to prevent them from that which is wanted with them."
