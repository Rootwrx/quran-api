(A place of worship) i.e. the mosque of Quba' (which was founded upon duty (to Allah)) which was founded upon obedience and remembrance of Allah (from the first day) the Prophet (pbuh) entered Medina; it is also said this means: the first mosque ever built in Medina (is more worthy) is more right (that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein) in the mosque of Quba', (wherein are men who love to purify themselves) men who wash their behinds with water [after defecating]. (Allah loveth the purifiers) those who purify themselves from filth with water."
