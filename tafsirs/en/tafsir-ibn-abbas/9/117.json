  "text": "(Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet) Allah has forgiven the Prophet, (and to the Muhajirin and the Ansar) as He has forgiven the Emigrants and the Helpers who prayed towards the two Qiblahs and had participated in the Battle of Badr. Allah then explained who these were, saying: (who followed him) who followed the Prophet in the Battle of Tabuk (in the hour of hardship) at a time of hardship and adversity. They were short of provision and mounts and in great hardship because of the heat, the enemy and the long distance they had to travel. (After the hearts of a party of them had almost swerved aside) a party of sincere believers almost refrained from going forth with the Prophet (pbuh) (then turned He unto them in mercy) He forgave them and made their hearts firm such that they went with the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! He is Full of Pity, Merciful for them)."
