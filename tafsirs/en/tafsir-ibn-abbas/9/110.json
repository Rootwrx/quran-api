(Allah is Knower) of their building of a mosque of opposition as well as of their intentions, (Wise) when He ordained the destruction and burning of this mosque. After returning from the Battle of Tabuk, the Prophet (pbuh) sent 'Amir Ibn Qays and Wahshiyy, the client of Mut'am Ibn 'Adiyy, who destroyed and burnt this mosque of opposition."
