  "text": "(And of them) of the hypocrites: Judham Ibn Khalid, Iyyas Ibn Qays, Sammak Ibn Yazid and 'Ubayd Ibn Malik (are those who vex the Prophet) by slandering and vilifying him (and say) to one another: (He is only a hearer) he listens to us and believes us when we tell him we have not said anything against you. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (A hearer of good) and not evil (for you) i.e. he listens to you and believes what is good rather than believes that you are lying; it is also said that this means: if he is a hearer, then it is good for you, (who believeth in Allah) he believes in the word of Allah (and is true to the believers) and he believes the word of sincere believers, (and a mercy) preventing from torment (for such of you as believe) both inwardly and outwardly. (Those who vex the Messenger of Allah) by not joining him at the Battle of Tabuk. The reference here is to Jallas Ibn Suwayd, Sammak Ibn 'Amr, Mikhsha' Ibn Humayr and their host, (for them there is a painful doom) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter."
