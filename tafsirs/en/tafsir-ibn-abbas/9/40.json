(Lo! Allah is with us) and He will help us. (Then Allah caused His peace of reassurance) His tranquillity (to descend upon him) upon His Prophet (and supported him) helped him on the Day of Badr, at the battle of the troops and also on the Day of Hunayn (with hosts ye cannot see) i.e. with angels, (and made the word) the religion (of those who disbelieved the nethermost) blameworthy and defeated, (while Allah's word it was that became the uppermost) triumphant and praiseworthy. (Allah is Mighty) in retribution against his enemies, (Wise) in helping His friends."
