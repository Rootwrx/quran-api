  "text": "(Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly) those who find fault with 'Abd al-Rahman [Ibn 'Awf] and his fellow Companions who give alms, accusing them of showing off and seeking fame (and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours) and discredit those who do not find anything to give away except their effort. This refers to Abu 'Uqayl 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn Tijan who could not find anything to give for alms except a measure of dates, (and deride them) because of the little alms he gave. The hypocrites said about him: he did not bring this except that he wished to be mentioned and be given more alms than he gave himself, (Allah (Himself) derideth them) on the day of Judgement. (Theirs will be a painful doom) in the Hereafter."
