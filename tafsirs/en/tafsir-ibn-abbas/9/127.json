  "text": "(And whenever a surah is revealed) whenever Gabriel brings down a surah exposing the fault of the hypocrites and the Prophet (pbuh) used to recite to them, (they) the hypocrites (look one at another (as who should say): Doth anybody) among the sincere believers (see you? Then they turn away) from the prayer, the sermon, the Truth and guidance. (Allah turns away their hearts) from the Truth and guidance; it is also said: they swerved from the Truth and guidance, and so Allah swerved their hearts from the Truth and guidance (because they are a folk who understand not) nor believe in the command of Allah."
