(So, if ye repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an, (it will be better for you) than idolatry; (but if ye are averse) to faith and repentance, (then know) O idolaters (that ye cannot escape Allah) you cannot escape His punishment. (Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to those who disbelieve) i.e. that they will be killed after the elapse of four months."
