Allah will chastise them at your hands) He will chastise them by means of your swords, i.e. by killing them, (and He will lay them low) He will abase them by means of defeat (and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers) by the exultation of the Banu Khuza'ah, in that they were allowed to kill their enemies for a while in the Sacred Precinct upon the Conquest of Mecca."
