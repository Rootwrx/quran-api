  "text": "(Those who were left behind rejoiced) the hypocrites were pleased (at sitting still) at staying behind and not joining the battle of Tabuk (behind the Messenger of Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way) in obedience of Allah. (And they said) to one another: (Go not forth in the heat!) do not go with Muhammad (pbuh) to the battle of Tabuk in the scorching heat. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The heat of hell is more intense of heat) is most intense in firebrands, (if they but understood) and believed."
