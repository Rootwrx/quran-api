Allah hath bought from the believers) who are sincere (their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs) in exchange for the Garden (they shall fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah (and shall slay) the enemy (and be slain) by the enemy. (It is a promise) from Allah (which is binding on Him) that He must fulfil (in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made) with Allah, i.e. the Garden, (for that is the Supreme Triumph) the abounding safety."
