Unto Him belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens) the stores of the heavens: the sun, the moon, etc., (and the earth) the stores of the earth such as the trees, beasts, mountains, seas, etc. (He quickeneth) for the resurrection (and He giveth death) in the life of this world. (And ye have, instead of Allah) against the punishment of Allah, (no protecting friend) to benefit you (nor helper) to save you from His punishment."
