  "text": "(And he of Egypt) the Chief Official, who was the treasurer of the king and the chief of his soldiers. His name was Potiphar (Qitfir) (who purchased him said unto his wife) Zelicha (Zulaykha): Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us) in our farm (or we may adopt him as a son). This man bought Joseph for the price of 20 silver coins, a garment and a pair of sandals. (Thus We established Joseph) We gave him authority (in the land) of Egypt (that We might teach him the interpretation of events) the interpretation of dreams. (And Allah was predominant in his career) Allah is dominant in things destined; no one can repel His destined things, (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) nor believe; it is also said that this means: most do not know that Allah is dominant in the things that He destined."
