(And when the messenger) the cupbearer (came unto him) to Joseph and informed him that the king wanted to see him, (he said) Joseph said to him: (Return unto thy lord) your master, the king (and ask him what was the case of the women) he said: go and ask the king to enquire about what really happened with those women (who cut their hands) who slashed and grazed their hands. (Lo! my lord) my master (knoweth their guile) their scheming and doing."
