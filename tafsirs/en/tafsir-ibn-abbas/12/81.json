Lo! thy son hath stolen) the king's golden cup; it is also said that this means: your son was taken for stealing. (We testify only to that which we know) we saw the stolen cup found in his bag; (we are not guardians of the Unseen) he said: if we knew the unseen, we would not have taken him; it is also said that this means: we could not look after him at night."
