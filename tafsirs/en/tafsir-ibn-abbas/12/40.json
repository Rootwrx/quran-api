(Allah hath revealed no sanction) no Scripture or proof (for them) for your worship of them. (The decision) the judgement of commands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: judgement in the life of this world and in the Hereafter (rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you) in all revealed Scriptures (that ye worship) that you profess the divine Oneness of (none save Him) save Allah. (This) profession of divine Oneness (is the right religion) the established Religion that He is pleased with: i.e. Islam, (but most men) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it."
