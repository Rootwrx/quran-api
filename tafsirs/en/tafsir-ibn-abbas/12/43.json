I saw in a dream seven fat kine) coming out of a river (which seven lean were eating) the seven lean kine, that were dying of lack of nourishment swallowed up the fat kine, but even then it was as if they did not eat anything, (and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) the dry ones coiling around the green ones such that they overshadowed their greenery and became unnoticeable. (O notables!) Meaning: the soothsayers, sorcerers and fortune-tellers, (Expound for me my vision) interpret for me my dream, (if ye can interpret dreams) if you know how to interpret dreams."
