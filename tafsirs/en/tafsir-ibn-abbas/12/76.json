  "text": "(Then he) Joseph's servant (began the search with their bags before) searching (his brother's bag) where he obviously did not find it, (then he produced it from his brother's bag) from his brother Benjamin's bag. The servant said to him: \ufffdMay Allah lift your trouble as you have lifted mine\ufffd. (Thus did We contrive) We did (for Joseph) We honoured him with knowledge, wisdom, prophethood and sovereignty. (He could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed) and Allah willed that he does take his brother according to the king's law because, according to the latter, the penalty for theft was beating and payment of a fine; it was also said that according to the king's law, the penalty for theft was the amputation of limbs and payment of a fine; it is also said that (unless Allah willed) means: except those laws of the king which Joseph knew to be pleasing to Allah, for he applied those. (We raise by grades (of mercy)) We raise the virtues of (whom We will) as We do in the life of this world, (and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing) above every one who knows there someone who knows more, and so on and so forth until one stops at Allah, for there is no one who has more knowledge than Him."
