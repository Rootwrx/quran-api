  "text": "When he went to him, he said: (Joseph! O thou truthful one!) O you who were truthful in interpreting the first dream, (Expound for us the seven fat kine) that came out of the river and (which seven lean) that were dying of lack of nourishment (were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) coiling around the seven green ears, overshadowing their greenery, (that I may return unto the people) to the king, (so that they may know) the interpretation of the king's dream. Joseph said: \ufffdYes! I will interpret his dream. The seven fat kine are seven years of soil fertility, and the seven green ears represent abundance and low prices during these seven years. The seven dying, lean kine represent years of drought while the seven dry ears represent lack of foodstuff and high prices during these years\ufffd."
