I saw in a dream) that I dreamt during the day (eleven planets) they came down from their orbits and prostrated themselves before me, a prostration of greeting-these are his brothers who were eleven in number-(and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me) he says: and I saw the sun and the moon coming down from their orbits and prostrated themselves before me, a prostration of greeting-these are his parents: Rachel and Jacob."
