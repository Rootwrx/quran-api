  "text": "(And when they came (again) before him (Joseph)) a third time (they said: O ruler! Misfortune) hunger (hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise) merchandise which is not suitable for buying food, but are suitable for spending on people; it is also said that this means: merchandise that one can get in the mountains such as pine nuts and the fruit of the terebinth-tree; it is also said that this means: Arab merchandise such as dried lumps of cheese, wool, cheese and ghee, (so fill for us the measure) give us our measure as you would give if we had good money (and be charitable unto us) in regards to difference in the two prices; it is also said that this means: in regards to difference in the two measures. (Lo! Allah will requite the charitable) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter."
