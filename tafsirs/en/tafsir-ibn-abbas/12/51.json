  "text": "The messenger went back and informed the king who summoned the four women: the wife of his cupbearer, the wife of his chief cook, the wife of the master of his stable and the wife of the Chief Official. These four women were the most powerful personalities after the king. (He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered: Allah Blameless!) God forbid! (We know) we saw (no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the Truth is out) in favour of Joseph; it is also said that this means: now is the time to tell the truth. (I asked of him an evil act) I offered myself to him, (and he is surely of the Truthful) that he did not ask an evil act of me."
