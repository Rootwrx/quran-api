  "text": "(And they came with false blood on his shirt) they stained his shirt with the blood of a goat. (He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into) they embellished to you to do (something) regarding the peril of Joseph and you did it. ((My course is) comely patience) I have only to be patient without showing any alarm. (And Allah it is whose help is to be sought) I seek the help of Allah (in that (predicament) which ye describe) to be patient for his death, as you say. But he did not believe them because in another occasion they said that Joseph was killed by thieves."
