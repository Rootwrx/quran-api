  "text": "(He said) their father said to them: (I will not send him with you) simply because of your mere talk (till ye give me an undertaking) a pledge (in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are surrounded) unless an accident from heaven befalls you; it is also said that this means: unless an accident from heaven or from the earth descends upon you. (And when they gave him their undertaking) when they gave him their pledge in the name of Allah that they will bring him back (he said) Jacob said: (Allah is the Warden over what we say) Allah is a Witness over what we say; it is also said that this means: Allah is Custodian over what we say."
