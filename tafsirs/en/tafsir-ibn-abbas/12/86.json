  "text": "(He said) Jacob said: (I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not) I know that Joseph's vision is true and that we will prostrate to him; it is also said that this means: I know of Allah's mercy and of His good work that which you do not; it is also said that this means: I know that Joseph is alive. That is because the angel of death came to him and he asked him: \" did you take away the soul of Joseph from among those you took their souls away \". And the angel said he did not."
