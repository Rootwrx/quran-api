  "text": "(And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released) from prison, i.e. the cupbearer: (Mention me in the presence of thy lord) your master the king; tell him that I have been wronged: my brothers sold me when I being a free man and I was put into prison while being innocent. (But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord) Satan made him so preoccupied that he forgot to mention Joseph to his master, the king. It is also said that this means: Satan whispered to him: if you mention prison to the king, he will put you back in it. This is why he did not mention Joseph to the king; it is also said that the meaning of this is: Satan made Joseph forget the remembrance of his Lord and instead remembered a created being like him, (so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years) seven years, as a punishment for not mentioning Allah, when he had already spent five years in jail."
