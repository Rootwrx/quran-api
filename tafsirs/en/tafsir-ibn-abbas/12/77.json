  "text": "(They said) the brothers of Joseph said: (If he stealeth) if Benjamin has stolen the king's cup, (a brother of his stole before) his full brother (Joseph) has stolen an idol before. (But Joseph kept it secret in his soul) he did not answer this (and revealed it not unto them) his response. (He said) within himself: (Ye are in worse case) your action is worse than that of Joseph (and Allah knoweth best (the Truth of) that which you allege) in relation to the matter of Joseph."
