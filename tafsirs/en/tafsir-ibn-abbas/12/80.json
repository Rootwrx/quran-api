The eldest of them) the best among them in reasoning: Judah (said: Know ye not) my brothers (how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah's name) that you will bring him back (and how you failed) in your pledge and covenant (in the case of Joseph aforetime) before this boy? (Therefore I shall not go forth from the land) of Egypt (until my father giveth leave) gives me leave to return; it is also said that this means: until my father gives me permission to fight them (or Allah judgeth for me) the return of my brother.
