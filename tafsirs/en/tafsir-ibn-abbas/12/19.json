  "text": "(And there came a caravan) of travellers from Midian who were going to Egypt. They lost their way and went round and round until they passed by the land where the pit was. This land is called Dawthan, midway between Midian and Egypt, and there the caravan decided to have a break, (and they sent their water-drawer) each group of people sent their water-drawer. The pit in which Joseph was thrown was the lot of an Arab man from Midian called Malik Ibn Du'ar who was the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb, Allah give him peace. (He let down his pail (into the pit)) and Joseph got hold of it such that the water-drawer could not pull it back. When he looked down he saw a boy grabbing the pail of water and so he called his companions. (He said: Good luck!) \ufffdThis is my good luck, O my companions!\ufffd His companions asked him: \ufffdwhat is it, O Malik?\ufffd He said: (Here is a youth) the most handsome of youths. They gathered and got Joseph out of the pit. (And they hid him as a treasure) they concealed from their people the fact that they found him in the pit, and instead informed them that the owners of the pit entrusted them to sell him in Egypt for them (and Allah was Aware of what they did) to Joseph, i.e. what the brothers of Joseph did to him; it is also said that this refers to the people of the caravan."
