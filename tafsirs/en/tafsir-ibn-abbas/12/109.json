(Have they) the people of Mecca (not travelled in the land and seen) and reflect on (the nature of the consequence for) how was the end result of (those who were before them) among the disbelievers? (And verily the abode of the Hereafter) Paradise, (for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies and instead believe in Allah, Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (is best. Have ye then no sense?) do you not have the common sense to realise that the Hereafter is better than the life of this world; it is also said that this means: have you then no sense to realise that the life of this world is evanescent while the Hereafter is everlasting; it is also said that this means: do you not believe in that which befell the people of old as a result of their disbelief in the messengers?"
