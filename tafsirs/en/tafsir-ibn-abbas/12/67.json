  "text": "(And he said) to them: (O my sons! Go not in by one gate) do not go in through the same road; (go in by different gates) go in by different roads. (I can naught avail you as against Allah) against Allah's decree concerning you. (Lo! the decision) the judgement regarding what is decreed for you (rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust) I delegate my matter and yours to Him, (and in Him let all the trusting put their trust) those who rely should rely on Him; it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trust in Allah. Here, Jacob feared the evil eye against his sons, because they were all seemly and handsome."
