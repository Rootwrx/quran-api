  "text": "(And when they opened their belongings) their saddlebags (they discovered that their merchandise) the money which was to pay for the merchandise they bought (had been returned to them) along with the foodstuffs. (They said: O our father!) We are not lying about the kindness and generosity of the man towards us; it is also said that this means: we have not requested this from him (What (more) can we ask? Here is our merchandise) the money we gave for the price of the merchandise (returned to us) with the merchandise. This only shows his kindness towards us. Their father said to them: the man is only testing you, you must return the money to him. (We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother) Benjamin when we go and return, (and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load)) if he comes with us. (This is a light measure) because of which we shall be given more; it is also said that this means: this is a small thing that we are requesting from you."
