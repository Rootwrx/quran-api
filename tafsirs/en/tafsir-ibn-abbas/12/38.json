It never was for us) it was not permissible for us (to attribute aught) any idols (as partner to Allah. This) pure Religion, prophethood and Islam with which Allah has honoured us (is of the bounty of Allah unto us) a blessing that Allah blessed us with (and unto mankind) by sending us to them; it is also said that this means: this is a bounty unto the believers through the blessing of faith; (but most men) the people of Egypt (give not thanks) do not believe in this."
