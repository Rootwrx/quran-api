  "text": "(And he placed his parents on the dais) on an elevated platform (and they fell down before him prostrate) i.e. his parents and brothers fell prostrate before him. This prostration was a sign of greeting between them: the person of humble standing prostrated to the person of high standing, the youth to the elderly and the young to the old; it is a slight bowing as is known among non-Arabs, (and he said: O my father! This) prostration (is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison) and saved me from slavery (and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren) through resentful envy. (Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will) my Lord is tender in that He brought us together. (He is the Knower) of that which has befallen us, (the Wise) in separating and then bringing us together."
