  "text": "(It may be that those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (wish ardently that they were Muslims) in this worldly life. He says: there may come a day when the disbeliever would wish that he was a Muslim. This is because when Allah takes out of hell whoever was a sincere believer and enters them into Paradise, the disbeliever wishes at that moment he had been a Muslim in this worldly life."
