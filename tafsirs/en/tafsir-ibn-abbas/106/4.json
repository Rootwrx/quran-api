  "text": "(Who hath fed them against hunger) which lasted seven years; and it is also said this means: Who sufficed them the burden of hunger and travelling in winter and summer, because they used to make two trips a year, one in winter to Yemen and one in summer to Historic Syria, and so Allah sufficed them the burden of doing so (and hath made them safe from fear) of the enemy lest he attacks them; and it is also said: from the fear of the Negus and his host who wanted to destroy the Ka'bah; this surah is also in conjunction with the previous surah'."
