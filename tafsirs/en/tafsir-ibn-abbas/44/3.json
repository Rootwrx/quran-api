We revealed it) We sent Gabriel with the Qur'an; this is why Allah swore, Allah sent down Gabriel to the nether heaven to dictate the Qur'an to the scribes among the angels, who are the dwellers of the nether heaven (on a blessed night) wherein there is mercy, forgiveness and grace, this is the night of destiny.
