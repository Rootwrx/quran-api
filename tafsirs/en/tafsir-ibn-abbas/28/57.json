(Have We not established for them) We made them dwell in (a sure sanctuary) free of turmoil, (whereunto the produce of all things is brought (in trade), a provision from Our presence?) A sustenance for them from Us, so how am I to set the disbelievers on them if they were to believe? (But most of them know not) this nor believe in it."
