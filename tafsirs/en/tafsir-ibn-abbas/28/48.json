(Did they not) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old) i.e. the Torah before the coming of Muhammad (pbuh)? (They say) the disbelievers of Mecca say: (Two magics) i.e. the Qur'an and the Torah (that support each other; and they) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers) we disbelieve in both the Qur'an and the Torah."
