O our Lord! (Why sentest Thou no messenger unto us) with a Scripture before You chastised us, (that we might have followed Your revelations) Your Scripture and Messenger (and been of the believers) in the Scripture and Messenger? If it were otherwise, We would have destroyed them before you, but We have sent them the Qur'an so that they do not have any excuse against Us."
