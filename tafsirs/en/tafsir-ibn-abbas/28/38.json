(I know not that ye have a god other than me) therefore do not obey Moses, (so kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey) I may climb up to (the God of Moses) whom he claims is in heaven and send him to me; (and lo! I deem him of the liars) there is no god in heaven."
