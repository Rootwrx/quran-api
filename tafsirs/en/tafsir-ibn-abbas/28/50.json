(And who goeth farther astray) from the Truth and guidance (than he who followeth his lust) through disbelief, idolatry, and idol worship (without guidance from Allah) without proof or exposition from Allah. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host."
