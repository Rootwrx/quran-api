  "text": "Allah then said to him: (Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, O Moses, (it will come forth white) shining like the rays of the sun (without hurt) without being afflicted with leprosy. (And guard thy heart) and put back your hand in your armpit after that (from fear) from the difference, if people get scared. (Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: Lo! they are evil-living folk) disbelievers who caused corruption because of their state of idolatry."
