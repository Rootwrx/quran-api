  "text": "(And morning found those who had coveted his place) his status, standing and wealth (but yesterday crying) to one another: (Ah, welladay!) it is not as Korah said, i.e. that his wealth was his own doing, but rather (Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves) and in the case of Korah such wealth was a lure to perdition (and straiteneth it (for whom He will)) out of care for the person. (If Allah had not been gracious unto us) and withheld from us what He gave him, (He would have caused it to swallow us (also)) as it swallowed Korah. (Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper) they will never be safe from Allah's torment."
