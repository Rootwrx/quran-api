I fain would marry thee) O Moses (to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me) to look after my flock (for (the term of) eight pilgrimages) eight years. (Then if thou completest ten) ten years (it will be of thine own accord) the increase of term will be of your own accord, (for I would not make it hard for thee) by increasing the term. (Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous) who fulfil their promise."
