(And he found apart from them two women keeping, back (their flocks)) until the men finished watering their flocks, due to their weakness. (He said: What aileth you) what holds you back? (The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water) until they finish watering their flocks; (and our father is a very old man) and does not have anyone to help him except us."
