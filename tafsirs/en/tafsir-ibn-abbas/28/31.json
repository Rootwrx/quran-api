(And when he saw it) after throwing it down (writhing) moving with its head up (as it had been a demon) a serpent neither big nor small, (he turned to flee headlong) from it, without looking back; but Allah said: (O Moses! Draw nigh) to it (and fear not) from it. (Lo! thou art of those who are secure) from its evil. When Moses picked it up, it was a staff like it was originally."
