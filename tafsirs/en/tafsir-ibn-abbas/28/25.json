Then, when he came unto him) when Moses went to Yathron, the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb who had died before (and told him) told Yathron (the (whole) story) of his escape from Pharaoh and the rest of it, (he said) Yathron said to him: (Fear not! thou hast escaped from the wrong-doing folk) the people of Egypt."
