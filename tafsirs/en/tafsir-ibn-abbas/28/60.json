  "text": "(And whatsoever ye have been given) whatever you are given of wealth and servants, (is a comfort of the life of the world) is like the ornament of the life of the world: like pottery and glass (and an ornament thereof) and an embellishment, and the latter does not last forever; (and that which Allah hath) for Muhammad and his Companions in Paradise (is better and more lasting) than that which you have in the life of the world. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not possess sound thinking to realise that this worldly life is perishing while the Hereafter is lasting?"
