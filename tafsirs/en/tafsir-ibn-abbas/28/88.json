(There is no god save Him) alone without partners. (Everything) all works that are for other than Allah's Countenance (will perish) will not be accepted (save His Countenance) except that which is meant for the sake of His Countenance; it is also said that this means: every countenance changes except Allah's and every kingdom will vanish except His. (His is the command) the judgement between people, (and unto Him ye will be brought back) after death and he will requite each according to his works'."
