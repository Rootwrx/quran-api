We make no distinction between any of them) we do not disbelieve in any of the prophets; it is also said this means: we do not disassociate any one of them from Allah in relation to prophethood and Islam, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge His worship and divine Oneness and we are sincere to him in Religion."
