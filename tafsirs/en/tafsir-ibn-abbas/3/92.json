  "text": "Allah then prompted the believers to spend in the cause of Allah, saying: (Ye will not attain unto piety) i.e. that which is with Allah of reward, honour and Paradise until you spend of that which you love of property; it is also said this means: you shall not attend to reliance in Allah and God-fearingness (until ye spend of that which ye love. And whatsoever ye spend) of property, (Allah is aware thereof) just as He is aware of your intentions, i.e. whether you intend with it His Countenance or other people's praise."
