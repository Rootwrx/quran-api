Allah hath charged us) Allah has commanded us in the Scripture (that we believe not in any messenger) we will not accept that anyone is sent with a message (until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour) that is until Allah sends a fire which will devour this offering, as it happened in the time of the [Jewish] prophets. (Say) O Muhammad: (Messengers came unto you before me with miracles) with commands and prohibitions as well as signs, (and with that (very miracle) which ye describe) of an offering [devoured by fire], Zachariah, John and Jesus. (Why then did ye slay them?) why did you kill John and Zachariah, when such an offering [devoured by fire] took place during their time. ((Answer that) if ye are truthful) in your claim."
