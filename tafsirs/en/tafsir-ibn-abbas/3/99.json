  "text": "(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers) in Allah, Muhammad and the Qur'an (from the way of Allah) from the Religion of Allah and His worship, (seeking to make it crooked, when you are witnesses?) when you know it to be in the Scripture. (Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is not oblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealed about those who invited 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism."
