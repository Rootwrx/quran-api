  "text": "Then Allah mentioned their surmise about the Prophet (pbuh) that he was not going to divide any of the booty among them, and because of this they left their positions, saying: (It is not for any Prophet) it is not permissible for any prophet (to deceive) to cheat his community regarding booty; it is also possible that the meaning is: it is not permissible for a community to deceive its prophet. (Whoso deceiveth) as regards any of the booty (will bring his deceit with him) carried on his neck (on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned) that which it has deceived and also other things; (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not be diminished and their evil deeds will not be increased."
