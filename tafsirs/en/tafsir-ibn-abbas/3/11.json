  "text": "(Like Pharaoh's folk) like the work of the folk of Pharaoh. Allah says here: your people have done with you-by giving you the lie and abusing you-as the people of Moses did with him: they gave him the lie and abused him. And We (Allah) shall do with them on the Day of Badr as We did with the people of Moses on the day of drowning, (and those who were before them) before the people of Moses, (they disbelieved Our revelations) they disbelieved in the Scripture and Messenger We sent to them (and so Allah seized them) destroyed them (for their sins) because of their denial. (And Allah is severe in punishment) when He does punish."
