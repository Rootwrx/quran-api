  "text": "Allah then mentioned their deaths and what happens after their deaths, saying: (Every soul) that breathes (will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned) the reward of your works. (Whoso is removed from the Fire) by means of declaring Allah's divine Oneness and doing righteous works (and is made to enter Paradise, he indeed is triumphant) in that he gains Paradise and that which it contains, and is further saved from hell and that which it contains. (The life of this world is but comfort of illusion) which is comparable to the relative duration of the stuff one has at home such as pottery, bottles, and the like."
