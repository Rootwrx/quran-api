(And to the House) going to the House (is a duty unto Allah for mankind) for the believers, (for him who can find a way thither) for the person who can walk and reach the House while at the same time being in possession of provisions, a mount and has left enough expenditure for his dependents until he returns. (As for him who disbelieveth) in Allah, Muhammad, the Qur'an and the obligation of pilgrimage, (Lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures) He is not in need of their belief or pilgrimage."
