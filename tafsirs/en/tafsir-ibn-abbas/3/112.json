  "text": "(Ignominy shall be their portion) the humiliation of Jizyah shall be imposed upon them (wheresoever they are found) they cannot stand against the believers (save (where they grasp) a rope from Allah) except if they believe in Allah (and a rope from men) or take a pledge with the rulers to pay the Jizyah. (They have incurred anger) they deserved anger (from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them) the attire of poverty was imposed upon them. (That) ignominy (is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and slew the Prophets wrongfully) i.e. without the prophets having committed any crime. (That) anger and humiliation (is because they were rebellious) against Allah on the Sabbath (and used to transgress) by killing the prophets and take as lawful things that were prohibited."
