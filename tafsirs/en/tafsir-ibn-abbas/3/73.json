(Say) to the Jews, O Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance is Allah's guidance) Allah's Religion is Islam and Allah's Qiblah is the Ka'bah, (that any one is given) of Religion and Qiblah (the like of that which was given unto you) O Companions of Muhammad (or that they may argue with you) that the Jews argue with you regarding this Religion and Qiblah (in the presence of their Lord) on the Day of Judgement. (Say) also, O Muhammad: (Lo! the bounty) prophethood, Islam and the Qiblah of Abraham (is in Allah's hand. He bestoweth it on whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions. (Allah is All- Embracing) in His bounty, (All-Knowing) to whom He gives."
