  "text": "Allah then mentions His promise to the believers on the Day of Uhud, saying: (Allah verily made good His promise unto you) on the Day of Uhud (when ye routed them) when you killed them at the beginning of the fight (by His leave) by His command and help, (until (the moment) when your courage failed you) to fight against the enemy, (and ye disagreed about the order) you disagreed about the question of war (and ye disobeyed) the Prophet by leaving your positions, (after He had shown you that for which ye long) victory and booty. (Some of you) some of the archers (desired the world) with their jihad and fighting. This refers to those who abandoned their positions and rushed to gather the booty, (and some of you desired the Hereafter) with their jihad and fighting. This refers to 'Abdullah Ibn Jubayr and his fellow believers who remained at their positions until they were killed. (Therefore He made you flee from them) defeated and made them triumph over you, (that He might try you) that He might test you with the archers' disobedience. (Yet now He hath forgiven you) He did not exterminate you. (Allah is a Lord of Kindness to believers) in that He did not exterminate them, i.e. the archers."
