(They quailed not) the believers did not weaken (for aught that befell them in the way of Allah) in terms of death and injury; it is also said that this means: how many prophets were killed alongside scores of believers, but the believers did not weaken due to that which befell them in the way of Allah-the killing of their prophets-in obedience of Allah, (nor did they weaken) they did not lack strength to fight their enemies, (nor were they brought low) they did not abase themselves before their enemy; it is also said that this means: they did not surrender to their enemy. (Allah loveth the steadfast) in fighting their enemy alongside their Prophet."
