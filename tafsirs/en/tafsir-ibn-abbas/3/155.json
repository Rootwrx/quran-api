  "text": "Allah then mentioned those who fled on the Day of Uhud, saying (Lo! those of you who turned back) defeated, meaning: 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and his fellow believers (on the day when the two hosts) the hosts of Muhammad and Abu Sufyan (met, Satan alone it was who caused them to backslide) Satan enticed them to believe that Muhammad was killed and thus fled to a place about six parasangs (farasikh) from the scene. They were six people in all, (because of some of that which they have earned) because of leaving their positions. (Now Allah hath forgiven them) since He did not exterminate them. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repented among them. (Clement) for He did not hasten their punishment."
