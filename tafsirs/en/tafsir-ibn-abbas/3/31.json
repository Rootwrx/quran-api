  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad!: (If ye love Allah) and His religion, (follow me) follow my Religion; (Allah will love you) He will increase your love (and forgive you your sins) which were committed when you followed Judaism. (Allah is Forgiving) of whoever repents, (Merciful) towards whoever dies in a state of repentance. This verse was revealed about the Jews who claimed they were the children of Allah and His beloved ones. When this verse was revealed 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: \ufffdMuhammad is commanding us to love him as the Christians loved Jesus\ufffd, and the Jews said: \ufffdMuhammad wants us to take him as a compassionate Lord, just as the Christians took Jesus as a compassionate Lord\ufffd."
