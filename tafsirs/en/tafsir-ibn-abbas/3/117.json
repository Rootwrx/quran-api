  "text": "(The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world) He says: the likeness of what the Jews spend when they are following Judaism (is as the likeness of a biting, icy wind which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves) by not giving what is due to Allah from it, (and devastateth it) ruined it; likewise, idolatry destroys one's spending just as wind destroys the harvest. (Allah wronged them not) by thwarting the benefit of their harvest and spending, (but they did wrong themselves) through disbelief and withholding what is due to Allah from the harvest."
