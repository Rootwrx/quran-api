  "text": "(Lo! This) which We have mentioned, O Muhammad, regarding Jesus and the delegation of Najran (verily is the true narrative) the true fact that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner. (There is no God save Allah) without a son or partner, (and lo! Allah is the Mighty) Who is vengeful against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) Who has commanded that none should be worshipped except Him; it is also said (the Wise) means: Allah ruled that they should go out and invoke His curse on those who lie, but the delegation of Najran refused to do so because they knew they were liars and that Muhammad was a true Prophet and emissary whose traits and description were to be found in their own Scripture."
