  "text": "(Lo! Those who disbelieve) in Allah and His Messenger, (and die in disbelief) disbelieving in Allah and His Messenger, (the (whole) earth) the weight of the earth (full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom). Allah says: If they were to give the equivalent of the earth's weight in gold to ransom themselves, it would not be accepted from them. (Theirs will be a painful doom) which will extend to their hearts (and they will have no helpers) anyone to save them from Allah's punishment. The verses from (Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief\ufffd. Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers) were revealed about ten hypocrites, namely, Tu'mah and his companions, who left Medina to Mecca as apostates from their religion, Islam. Some of them died as apostates, some were killed while some later returned to the fold of Islam."
