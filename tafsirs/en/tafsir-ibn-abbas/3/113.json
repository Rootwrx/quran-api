(Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community) He says: there are among them a group of upright people who are guided by Allah's divine Oneness: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (who recite the revelations of Allah) the Qur'an (in the night season) in the hours of the night in their prayer, (falling prostrate (before Him)) praying to Allah."
