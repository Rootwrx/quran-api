So pardon them) pardon your Companions for that which may ensue from them (and ask forgiveness for them) from that transgression which ensues from them (and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs) in matter of war. (And when thou art resolved) to do something, (then put your trust in Allah) to give you triumph and domination. (Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust) in Him."
