Allah is poor: He is asking us to give Him a loan\ufffd, saying (Verily Allah heard the saying of those) Finhas Ibn 'Azura' and his fellows (who said, (when asked for contributions to the war): \ufffdAllah, forsooth, is poor) He needs us to give Him a loan, (and we are rich!\ufffd) and we do not need a loan from Him. (We shall record their saying) We shall preserve for them what they have said in the Hereafter (with their slaying of the Prophets) just as We shall record for them their slaying of the prophets (wrongfully) without them having committed any crime (and We shall say: Taste ye the punishment of burning!) which is very severe."
