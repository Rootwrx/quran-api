Allah called him a devil because he was a follower of Satan and his whisperings (who would make (men) fear his partisans) He says: he makes you fear his partisans: the unbelievers. (Fear them not) in your sortie; (fear Me) if you stay back, (if you are true believers) if you believe in His bringing back the dead to life."
