(Whoso desireth) with his works and jihad (the reward of the world) the benefit of this worldly life, (We bestow on him thereof) We shall give him from this worldly life what he desires but he does not have any share in the Hereafter; (and whoso desireth) with his works and jihad (the reward of the Hereafter) the benefit of the Hereafter, (We bestow on him thereof) We shall give him of the Hereafter what he desires. (We shall reward the thankful) reward the believers for their faith and jihad."
