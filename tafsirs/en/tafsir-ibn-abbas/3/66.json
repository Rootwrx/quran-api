Ye) O Jews and Christians (are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge) in your Scripture that Muhammad is a prophet sent by Allah and that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian, but you rejected this: (Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge) from your Scripture and say that Abraham was Jew or Christian? (Allah knoweth) that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian. (Ye know not) that he was Jew or Christian."
