  "text": "Allah then mentions the bounties of the life of this world that He has made attractive for the unbelievers, saying: (Beautified for mankind is) what people's hearts find desirable is (love of the joys (that come) from women) meaning slave women and wives (and offspring) slaves and children, (and stored up heaps) amassed wealth (of gold and silver) it is also said that this means: minted or engraved gold and silver, (and horses branded (with their mark)) beautiful branded horses and grazing in pastures, (and cattle) i.e. sheep, cows and camels (and land) cultivation and cultivated lands. (That) which is mentioned above (is comfort of the life of the world) is of benefit to people in the life of this world and then it vanishes; it is also said that this means: the joys of this world last only for as long as the stuff of any home, a bowl, a plate and the like. (Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode) in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise, to whoever shun such joys."
