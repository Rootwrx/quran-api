(They purchase not a trifling gain) a paltry recompense of means of living (at the price of the revelations of Allah) by hiding the traits and description of Muhammad in the Scripture. (Verily their reward) their recompense (is with their Lord) in Paradise, (and Lo! Allah is swift to take account) when He takes people into account, He is very swift."
