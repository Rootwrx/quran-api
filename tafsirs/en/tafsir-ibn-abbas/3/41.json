((The angel) said: The token unto thee) about your wife's pregnancy ((shall be) that thou shalt not speak) will not be able to speak (unto mankind three days) without being dumb (except by signs) by moving your lips, eyebrows, eyes and hands; it is also said: except by writing on the ground. (Remember your Lord) with your tongue and heart (much) in all circumstances, (and praise (Him) in the early hours of night and morning) pray in the morning and at night as you used to do."
