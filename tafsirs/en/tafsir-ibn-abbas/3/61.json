  "text": "Allah then mentioned the dispute of the delegation of Najran with the Prophet (pbuh) after he explained to them that the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam, for they said to the Prophet: it is not as you say that Jesus was not Allah, his son or His partner. As response Allah said: (And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him) concerning Jesus, (after the knowledge which has come unto thee) after the exposition that has come to you that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons) and you summon your sons, (and our women and your women) and you summon your women, (and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord)) and exert our effort in praying ((and (solemnly) invoke) all together (the curse of Allah upon those who lie) about Allah concerning Jesus."
