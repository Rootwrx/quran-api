  "text": "Allah then mentioned their punishment, i.e. the punishment of the Jews, saying: (Lo! those who purchase a small gain) a small gain of in their living (at the cost of Allah's covenant) by breaking Allah's covenant (and their oaths) their pledges with their prophets, (they have no portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise. (Allah will neither speak to them) in a nice manner on the Day of Judgement (nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection) He will have no mercy for them, (nor will He make them grow) He will neither exonerate them for being Jews nor put their minds at peace. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a severe pain which will spread to their hearts. It is also said that this was revealed about 'Abdan Ibn al-Ashu' and Imra' al-Qays because of a dispute between them, and it was also revealed about the Jews."
