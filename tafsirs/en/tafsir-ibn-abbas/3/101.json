  "text": "(How can ye disbelieve) in Allah. This is mentioned by way of amazement, (when it is ye unto whom Allah's revelations) the Qur'an containing commands and prohibitions (are recited, and His messenger) Muhammad (is in your midst?) with you. (He who holdeth fast to Allah) he who adheres to Allah's Religion and His Book, (he indeed is guided unto a right path) he is directed along a clear, solid way, which is Islam; it is also said this means: he has become firm on this way. This verse was revealed about Mu'adh [Ibn Jabal] and his companions."
