  "text": "Then Allah mentioned how the hypocrites hastened to ally themselves with the Jews, saying: (Let not their conduct grieve thee) O Muhammad, or sadden you, (who run easily) who hasten (to disbelief) the hastening of the hypocrites to ally themselves with the Jews, (for Lo! they injure Allah not at all) they will not harm Allah by hastening to join the Jews as allies. (It is Allah's will) Allah wants (to assign them) i.e. the Jews and hypocrites (no portion) no share (in the Hereafter) in Paradise, (and theirs will be an awful doom) as awful as can be."
