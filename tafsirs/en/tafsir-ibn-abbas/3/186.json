  "text": "Allah then mentioned the harm that the unbelievers inflicted on the Prophet and his Companions, saying: (Assuredly ye will be tried) you will be tested (in your property) by the loss of your property (and in your persons) and in what befalls your persons of sicknesses, pain, killings, beatings and general misfortunes, (and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you) i.e. the Jews and Christians: you will hear vilification, defamation, lies and false testimony against Allah, (and from the idolaters) i.e. the Arab idolaters. (But if ye persevere) in the face of their harm (and ward off (evil)) and ward off transgressing against Allah while facing such harm, (then that) steadfastness and endurance (is of the steadfast heart of things) is the best of things and the most firm for believers."
