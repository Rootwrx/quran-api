  "text": "(There was a token) a sign confirming the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) (for you) O people of Mecca (in two hosts) in two groups: that of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan (which met) on the Day of Badr: (one army fighting in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah: Muhammad and his Companions who were 313 men, (and another disbelieving) and another group of disbelievers in Allah and the Messenger: Abu Sufyan and his army which consisted of 950 men, (whom they saw) they saw themselves (as twice their number) as twice the number as that of the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (clearly, with their very eyes). It is also said that this can be understood in this way: Say, O Muhammad, to the unbelievers-the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir-you shall be overcome and killed and expelled, and after you die, you will be mustered in Gehenna, an evil abode and end. Allah informed them of this two years before the Battle of Badr took place. Then He revealed: O Jews! You had a sign for the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) in the form of two groups-that of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan-who met on the Day of Badr. One group (Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions) fought in obedience of Allah, and the other group consisted of unbelievers in Allah and His Messenger (Abu Sufyan and his group). You saw with your very eyes, O Jews, that the unbelievers were twice the number of the Companions of Muhammad. (Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He will) i.e. Muhammad. (Lo! Herein) in Allah enabling Muhammad to triumph on the Day of Badr (verily is a lesson for those who have eyes) concerning Religion, i.e. the believers; it is also said that this means: it was a lesson for those who saw it with their own eyes."
