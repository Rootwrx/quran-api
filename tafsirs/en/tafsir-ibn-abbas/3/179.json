  "text": "With regard to the idolaters saying to Muhammad: \ufffdYou say to us that there are amongst us believers and unbelievers. Show us, O Muhammad, who believes among us and who does not\ufffd, Allah then said: (It is not (the purpose) of Allah to leave the believers) and unbelievers (in your present state) of religion until the believer becomes an unbeliever and the unbeliever becomes a believer if it is so in His decree (till He shall separate the wicked from the good) the damned from the felicitous, the unbeliever from the believer and the hypocrite from the sincere. (And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you know) O people of Mecca (the unseen) such that you know who believes and who does not. (But Allah chooseth) selects (of His messengers whom He will) i.e. Muhammad, and informs him of some of the unseen through revelation. (So believe in Allah and His messengers) believe in all the messengers and Scriptures. (If ye believe) in Allah and all the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief and idolatry, (yours will be a vast reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
