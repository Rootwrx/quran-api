  "text": "Subsequently, Allah mentions the trustworthiness and treachery of the people of the Book, saying: (Among the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews (there is he who, if you trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to you) without any problem, hardship or ever thinking to keep it for himself by declaring it lawful for him to take. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (And among them there is he who, if you trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to you) and will declare it lawful for him to take (unless you keep standing over him) insisting on taking it back and suing him for it. The reference here is to Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his followers. (That) treachery and declaring that it is lawful to take other people's property (is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles) there is no harm in taking the property of Arabs. (They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly) they lie about Allah and know that they are lying."
