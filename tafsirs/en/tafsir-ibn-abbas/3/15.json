(For those who keep from evil) keep from disbelief, ascribing partners to Allah and indecencies, in reference to Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (with their Lord, are Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) of wine, honey, milk and water (flow, wherein they will abide for ever) they will dwell in Paradise: they shall neither die nor leave it (and pure companions) they have therein spouses who are spared menses and filth, (and contentment from Allah) and the contentment of Allah is far greater than the bliss they enjoy. (Allah is Seer of His bondmen) He is Seer of the believers, their places in Paradise, as well as their works in the life of this world."
