Ye are) O group of believers (those who love them) who love the Jews because of the ties of marriage and suckling (though they love you not) because of the Religion, (and ye believe in all the Scripture) you acknowledge all the revealed Books and messengers while they do not. (When they) the hypocrites among the Jews (fall in with you they say: We believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an and we acknowledge that his traits and description are in our Scripture; (but when they go apart) and meet with each other (they bite their finger tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! Allah is Aware of what is hidden in (your) breasts) He is Aware of what is in your heart of hatred and enmity."
