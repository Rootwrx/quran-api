  "text": "(And their Lord hath heard them) and answered their request ((and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of any worker, male or female, to be lost) I thwart not the actions of any one of you. (Ye proceed one from another) if some of you follow the religion of others or are allies to them. Allah then exposited the honour He bestowed upon the Emigrants (al-Muhajirun), saying: (So those who fled) from Mecca to Medina with the Prophet (pbuh) and after the Prophet (and were driven forth from their homes) the Meccan unbelievers drove them from their homes in Mecca (and suffered damage for My cause) for My obedience, (and fought) the enemy in the way of Allah (and were slain) until they were killed, (verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them) which were committed in the course of jihad (and verily I shall bring them into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow. A reward from Allah) a recompense for them from Allah. (And with Allah is the fairest of rewards) a good return which is better than their reward."
