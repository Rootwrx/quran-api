O Master of kings and Owner of sovereignty (Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou wilt) i.e. unto Muhammad and his followers, (and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt) i.e. from the people of Persia and Byzantium. (Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt) i.e. Muhammad (and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the people of Persia and the people of Byzantium. (In Thy hand is the good) exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph and power. (Lo! Thou art Able to do all things) whether it is exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph or power. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, who said after the Conquest of Mecca: \ufffdHow on earth can they have sovereignty over Persia and Byzantium?\ufffd It is also said that it was revealed about the Quraysh who said: \ufffdthe king of Persia sleeps on couches made of silk brocade, if you are truly a prophet, show us your dominion?\ufffd"
