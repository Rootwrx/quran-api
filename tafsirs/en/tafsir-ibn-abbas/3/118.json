  "text": "Allah then forbade the believers from among the Helpers to speak with the Jews or divulge secrets to them, saying: (O ye who believe! Take not) the Jews (for intimates) confidants (others than your own folk) the sincere believers, (who would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you) they love for you to sin and become idolaters as they themselves have become. (Hatred is revealed by (the utterance of) their mouths) through vilification and defamation, (but that which their breasts hide is greater) but what they hide in their hearts of hatred and enmity is even greater. (We have made plain for you the revelations) the signs of their resentful envy (if you will understand) what is recited to you; it is also said that this means: We have made the revelations, i.e. the commands and prohibitions, clear so that you know what I command you."
