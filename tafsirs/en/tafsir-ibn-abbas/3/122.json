  "text": "(When two parties of you almost) two tribes of believers, the Banu Salamah and Banu Harithah, hid the fact that they almost (fell away) shrank away from fighting against the enemy on the Day of Uhud, (and Allah was their Protecting Friend) He preserved them and prevented them from doing so. (In Allah do believers put their trust) the believers ought to put their trust in Allah when it comes to help and conquest."
