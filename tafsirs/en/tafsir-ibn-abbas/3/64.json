  "text": "After this, Allah invited them to accept Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (Say: O People of the Scripture. Come to an agreement) the agreement is: there is no god except Allah (between us and you: that we shall worship none but Allah) we shall declare Allah as the only One God, (and that we shall ascribe no partners unto Him) from among created beings, (and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah) that none of us shall obey another person in that which involves a transgression against Allah. (And if they turn away) and refuse to accept Allah's divine Oneness, (then say: Bear witness) know (that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him)) and acknowledge His divine Oneness and worship Him."
