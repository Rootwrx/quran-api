(Endure) in jihad along with your Prophet, (outdo all others in endurance) overwhelm and overcome your enemy, (be ready) along with your Prophet for your enemy as long as they stand in wait to attack you; it is also said that this means: (Endure) the performance of the obligations and the avoidance of transgressions, (outdo all others in endurance) overwhelm and overcome the partisans of deviant beliefs and blameworthy innovations, (be ready) with your horses for the sake of Allah, (and observe your duty to Allah) obey Allah in that which He has commanded you, such that you never abstain from it, (in order that ye may succeed) in order that you be saved from Allah's wrath and punishment'."
