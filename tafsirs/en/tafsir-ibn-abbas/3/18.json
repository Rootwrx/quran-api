And the angels) do also bear witness to that (and the men of learning) and the prophets and the believers bear witness to that. (Maintaining His creation in justice, there is no God save Him, the Almighty) in His vengeance against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) and He has commanded that none shall be worshipped except Him."
