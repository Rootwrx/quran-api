  "text": "(And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance) He was good to her and accepted her instead of accepting a boy (and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth) He nurtured her well in worship throughout the years, months, days and hours; (and made Zachariah her guardian) he joined her to him for training. (Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was) the room where she worshipped, (he found that she had food) the fruit of winter in the summer, such as culms of corn, and the fruits of summer in the winter such as grapes. (He said: O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)?) how did you get this food out of its season? (She answered: It is from Allah) Gabriel brought it to me. (Allah giveth without stint) without pause or measure (to whom He will) in its season or out of it."
