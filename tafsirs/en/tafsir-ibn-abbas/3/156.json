(Be not) in war (as those who disbelieved) in secret, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers who returned to Medina (and said of their brethren) the hypocrites (who went abroad in the land) who journeyed with the Companions of Muhammad (or were fighting in the field) or went with their Prophet in a fighting expedition: (If they had been (here) with us) in Medina (they would not have died) on their journey (or been killed) during the fighting expedition; (that Allah may make it) make that doubt (anguish) grief (in their hearts. Allah giveth life) on the journey (and causeth death) settlement; (and Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you say."
