  "text": "(Lo! Religion) that is accepted (with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His will and guidance)). It is also said that this should be understood as: Allah bears witness that Religion with Him is Islam (the Surrender), and the angels, the prophets and the believers also bear witness to this. This verse was revealed about two men from Historic Syria who asked the Prophet (pbuh) which is the greatest witness in the Book of Allah. When he informed them about it, they embraced Islam. (Those who (formerly) received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (differed) about Islam and Muhammad (only after knowledge) the exposition of what is in their Scripture (came unto them, through transgression among themselves) out of resentful envy. (Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an ((will find that) Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning) severe in His punishment."
