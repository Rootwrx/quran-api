(And remember Allah's favour unto you) by giving you Islam: (how ye were enemies) before Islam (and He made friendship between your hearts) through Islam (so that ye became as brothers by His grace) by His religion, Islam; (and (how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire) i.e. because of disbelief, (and He did save you from it) by means of faith. (Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations) His commands, prohibitions and favours (unto you, that haply ye may be guided) from error."
