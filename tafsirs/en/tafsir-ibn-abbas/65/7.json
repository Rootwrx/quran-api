  "text": "(Let him) i.e. the father, (who hath abundance) who is well off (spend of his abundance) according to his wealth, (and he whose provision is measured) and he whose livelihood is tight, (let him spend) on breastfeeding (of that which Allah hath given him) according to what Allah has given him. (Allah asketh naught of any soul) regarding payment for breastfeeding (save that which He hath given it) save according to what he has given it of wealth. (Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship) in expenditure, (ease) after poverty there will be richness, for the one who suffers hardship of living awaits provision from Allah."
