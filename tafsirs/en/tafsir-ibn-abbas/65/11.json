(And whosoever believeth in Allah) and Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (and doeth right) sincerely between himself and his Lord, (He will bring him) in the Hereafter (into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) river of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) they will dwell in the Garden, never to die or leave. (Allah hath made good provision for him) Allah has prepared a reward for him in Paradise."
