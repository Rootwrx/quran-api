  "text": "(And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) this was revealed about 'Awf Ibn Malik al-Ashja'i whose son was captured by the enemy, and who returned later on to his family bringing with him many camels. (And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah) and whoever relies on Allah regarding provision, (He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass) His command and decree will come to pass in times of both comfort and hardship; it is also said this means: His command and providence will come to pass. (Allah hath set a measure) an appointed term (for all things) for both comfort and hardship. When Allah explained the waiting period of women who are divorced, Mu'adh stood up and said: \ufffdO Messenger of Allah! What is the waiting period for those women who despair of menstruation?\ufffd"
