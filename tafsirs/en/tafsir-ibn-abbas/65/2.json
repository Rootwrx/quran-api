  "surah": 65,
  "ayah": 2,
  "text": "(Then, when they have reached their term) when the waiting period is over, before having major ritual ablution, after the end of the third period of menstruation, (take them back in kindness) before they have major ritual ablution after the third period of menstruation, and then they should be treated with kindness (or part from them in kindness) do not prolong their waiting period, and give them all their rights, (and call to witness) both for divorcing them and taking them back (two just men among you) two free, upright, Muslim men, (and keep your testimony upright for Allah) and give your testimony before the judges for Allah's sake. (Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last) resurrection after death (is exhorted) believes (to act thus) i.e. regarding the expenditure, lodgement and delivering testimony. It is said that from the beginning of the surah up to here was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) when he divorced Hafsah, and also about six prophetic Companions, among whom was Ibn 'Umar, who divorced their wives when they were in their periods, and so Allah forbade them from doing so, because it does not comply with the prophetic practice of divorce, and taught them about the latter. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) upon committing a transgression and remain steadfast, (Allah will appoint a way out for him) from hardship; it is also said that this means: He will appoint a way out for him from transgression to acts of obedience; it is also said this means: from the Fire into Paradise,"
