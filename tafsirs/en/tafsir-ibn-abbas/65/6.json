  "text": "Allah then went back to the subject of divorcees and said: (Lodge them) lodge the women you divorce (where ye dwell) wherever you live, (according to your wealth) you provide expenditure and lodgement, (and harass them not) do not harass the women you divorce regarding expenditure and lodgement (so as to straiten life for them) and thus wrong them. (And if they are with child) and if the women you divorce are pregnant, (then spend for them) i.e. the husbands should spend for them (till they bring forth their burden) until they give birth to their child. (Then, if they give suck for you) if the mother breastfeeds a child of yours, (give them) i.e. the mothers (their due payment) for breastfeeding (and consult together in kindness) the husband should spend on the mother without stinginess or spendthriftness; (but if ye make difficulties for one another) i.e. regarding expenditure and the mother refuses to breastfeed the child, (then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child)) then another woman, other than the mother, should be sought to breastfeed the child."
