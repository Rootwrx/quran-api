(Said) Noah: (This day there is none that saveth) there is none that prevents (from the commandment of Allah) from Allah's chastisement: drowning (save him on whom He hath had mercy) except those upon whom Allah has mercy from among the believers. (And the wave came in between them) between Canaan and Noah; it is also said: between Canaan and the mountain, (so he was among the drowned) by the flood."
