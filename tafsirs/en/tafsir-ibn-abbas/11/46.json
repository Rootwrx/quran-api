Lo! he is not of your household) whom I promised to save; (lo! he is of evil conduct) engaged in idolatry; and according to a different reading this means: your prayer to Me to save him is not acceptable, (so ask not of Me) to save (that whereof thou hast no knowledge) that he is deserving of being saved. (I admonish thee) I warn you (lest thou be among the ignorant) by asking Me that which you know not."
