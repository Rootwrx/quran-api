  "text": "(He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am) He says: I am ((acting) on a clear proof from my Lord) on a clear exposition that has come down to me from my Lord (and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him) and He has favoured me with prophethood and Islam and further gave me a lawful property ((how can I concede aught to you)? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do) he says: I do not want to engage in that which I am warning you against: cheating in measure and weighing. (I desire naught save) I only desire (reform) justice in measure and weighing (so far as I am able. My welfare) in upholding right measurement and weighing (is only in Allah) is only from Allah. (In Him I trust) I entrust my matter to Him (and unto Him I turn) in complete devotion."
