Is my family) my clan (more to be honoured by you than Allah) than Allah's Book and religion; it is also said that this means: is the punishment of my clan more severe to you than Allah's chastisement? (And ye put Him) you placed Him (behind you, neglected) behind your back, i.e. you put that which I brought of the Book behind your backs. (Lo! my Lord surroundeth) knows (what ye do) the punishment you deserve for what you do."
