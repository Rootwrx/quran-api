Ask forgiveness of your Lord) believe in Allah's divine Oneness, (then turn unto Him repentant) then betake yourself to Him through repentance and sincerity; (He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you) whenever you need it (and will add unto you strength to your strength) by giving you wealth and offspring. (Turn not away) from faith and repentance, (guilty!) associating others with Allah."
