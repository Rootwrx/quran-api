Serve Allah) declare the divine Oneness of Allah, (You have no other God save Him) you have no god except the One in Whom I command you to believe. (He brought you forth from the earth) He created you from Adam and Adam is from the earth (and hath made you husband it) He made you thrive in the earth and made its inhabitants thrive on it too. (So ask forgiveness of Him) confess His divine Oneness (and turn unto Him repentant) turn to Him by believing in His divine Oneness, repenting and being sincere to Him. (Lo, my Lord is Nigh) in His answer, (Responsive) to the one who declares His divine Oneness."
