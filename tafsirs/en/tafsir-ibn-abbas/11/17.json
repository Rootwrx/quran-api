  "text": "(Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord) is he who relies on a clear exposition, i.e. the Qur'an, from his Lord, (and a witness from Him) a witness from Allah, i.e. the angel Gabriel (reciteth it) recites to him the Qur'an, (and before it) before the Qur'an (was the Book of Moses) the Torah of Moses which Gabriel recited to him, (an example) to be emulated (and a mercy) to anyone who believes in it? (such) those who believe in the Book of Moses (believe therein) believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; the reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (and Whoso disbelieveth therein) whoever disbelieves in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (of the clans) of all the disbelievers, (the Fire is his appointed place) the Fire is his destination. (So be not thou) O Muhammad (in doubt concerning it) concerning the end result of the disbelievers. (Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord) the destination of whosoever disbelieves in the Qur'an is hell; it is also said that this means: do not be in doubt about the Qur'an, it is Gabriel who brought it down; (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (believe not)."
