  "text": "(As though they had not dwelt there) it was as if they never lived on this earth. (A far removal for Midian) the people of Shu'ayb from the mercy of Allah, (even as Thamud) the people of Salih (had been removed afar) from the mercy of Allah! The people of Salih and the people of Shu'ayb were punished by the same chastisement. They were seized by the Cry that announced their chastisement, followed by extreme heat. This heat came to the people of Salih from beneath their feet while it came to the people of Shu'ayb from above their heads."
