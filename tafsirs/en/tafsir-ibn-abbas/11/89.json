Let not the schism with me cause you to sin) let not your hatred and enmity of me cause you not to believe or do justice in measure and weighing (so that there befall you that which befell the folk of Noah) i.e. the chastisement of the people of Noah: drowning and the flood (and the folk of Hud) their destruction by the wind, (and the folk of Salih) their destruction by the Cry; (and the folk of Lot) the news of the folk of Lot (are not far off from you) you heard what happened to them."
