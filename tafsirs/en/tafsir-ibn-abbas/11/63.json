Bethink you: if I am (acting) on clear proof from my Lord) a clear exposition that has come down from my Lord (and there hath come unto me a mercy from Him) and He has favoured me with prophethood and Islam, (who will save me) who will defend me (from Allah) from Allah's chastisement (if I disobey Him) and shun His command? (Ye would add to me naught save perdition) I only increase in insight about your loss."
