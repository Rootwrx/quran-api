(Thou thyself knewest it not) i.e. you knew not the news of these past nations, (nor did thy folk (know it) before this) before the revelation of the Qur'an. (Then have patience) O Muhammad in the face of their denial and harm. (Lo! the sequel) the end result: victory and Paradise (is for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
