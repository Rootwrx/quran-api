  "text": "(The similitude of the two parties) the believer and the disbeliever (is as the blind and the deaf) He says: the disbeliever is like the blind person: he does not see the Truth or guidance, and he is also like the deaf person: he does not hear the Truth or guidance (and the seer and the hearer) Allah says: and the believer is like the seer, for he sees the Truth and guidance, just as he is like the hearer, for he hears the Truth and guidance. (Are they equal in similitude?) He says: are the believer and disbeliever equal in obedience and reward (Will ye not then be admonished?) will you not be admonished by the similes of the Qur'an such that you believe?"
