(Yet if thou (O Muhammad) sayst) to the people of Mecca: (Lo! ye will be raised again) you will be brought back to life again (after death! those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (will surely say: This) which Muhammad (pbuh) is saying (is naught but mere magic) manifest lies which will never happen."
