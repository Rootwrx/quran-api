(He said) Lot said to them: (O my people! Here are my daughters!) it is also said that this means: here are the girls of my people! (They are purer for you) I will arrange your marriage. (Beware of Allah) fear Allah regarding the unlawful, (and degrade me not in (the person of) my guests) do not humiliate me in front of my guests.
