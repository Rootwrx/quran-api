(Not an animal but He doth grasp it by the forelock!) He makes die and brings back to life; it is also said that this means: they are all in His grip, He does what He will (Lo! my Lord is on a straight path) upon which people must tread; it is also said that means: He calls on to a straight path: an established religion with which He is pleased, i.e. Islam."
