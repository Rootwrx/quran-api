(For them) i.e. for the leaders (the torment will be double. They could not bear to hear) the words of Muhammad (pbuh) out of hatred for him; it is also said that this means: theirs is a double torment because they could not hear the words of Muhammad, Allah bless him and give peace, (and they used not to see) they did not look at Muhammad (pbuh) out of hatred; it is also said that this means: they used not to see Muhammad (pbuh) out of their hatred for him."
