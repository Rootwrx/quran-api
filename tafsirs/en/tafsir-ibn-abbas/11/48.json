  "text": "(It was said (unto him): O Noah! Go thou down) get out of the ship (with peace from Us) with safety from Us (and blessings) good fortunes (upon you and some nations) some groups (from those with thee) in the ship among the felicitous. ((There will be other) nations) hosts of people from their offspring (unto whom We shall give enjoyment a long while) We will give them enjoyment after coming out of the loins of their parents (and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them) after they disbelieve, these are the damned among them. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be well pleased with him, said: \ufffdAllah sent His revelation to Noah (pbuh) when the latter was 480 years old; he preached to his people for 120 years; he boarded the ship when he was 600 years old; he lived after the flood 350 years, and stayed on the ship for five months. The ship was 300 cubits (the measure of his arm) long, 50 cubits wide, and its height 30 cubits. It had three decks, some of which were lower than others. In the lower deck, he put beasts of prey and reptiles; in the intermediate deck wild animals and beasts; and in the higher deck people who were 80 in number: 40 men and 40 women. The men and the women were separated by the body of Adam (pbuh). Noah had three of his sons with him: Shem, Ham and Yapheth\ufffd."
