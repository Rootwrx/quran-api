(He will cause you to enjoy) He will make you live (a fair estate) free of chastisement (until a time appointed) i.e. death. (He giveth His bounty) in Islam (unto every bountiful one) his reward in the Hereafter. (But if ye turn away) from faith and repentance, (Lo! (then) I fear for you) I know that you shall incur (the retribution of an awful) a tremendous (Day)."
