Bethink you, if I rely) if I am (on a clear proof from my Lord) on a clear exposition which has come down from my Lord (and there hath come unto me a mercy from His presence) He favoured me with prophethood and Islam, (and it hath been made obscure to you) and my prophethood and Islam have been made obscure to you, (can we compel you to accept it) can we inspire it or teach it to you (when ye are averse thereto) when you are deniers of it?"
