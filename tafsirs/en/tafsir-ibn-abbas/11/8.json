(Verily on the day when it) the chastisement (cometh unto them, it cannot be averted from them) the chastisement will not be averted from them, (and that which they derided) the chastisement for their derision of Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (will surround them) it will descend upon them and it is enjoined on them."
