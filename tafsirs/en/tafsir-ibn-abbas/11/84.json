  "text": "(And unto Midian) and We sent to Midian (their brother Shu'ayb) their Prophet Jethro. (He said: O my people! Serve Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other God save Him!) you have no other god except the One I command you to believe in (And give not short measure and short weight) do not take people's right in measure and weight. (Lo! I see you well to do) I see that you are at ease, possess wealth and the prices are quite low, (and lo! I fear for you) if you do not believe in Him and do not give the right measure and weight (the doom of a besetting Day) a doom that will encompass all of you such that none will escape from drought, lack of foodstuffs and other bad things."
