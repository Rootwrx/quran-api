(Then began he to wring his hands) out of regret (for all that he had spent upon it) upon the garden; it is also said that this means: upon all the fruits it contained, (when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say) on the Day of Judgement: (Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!) would that I had ascribed no idols to my Lord!"
