(A speaker from among them) this is their chief and leader: Maxmillian (Maksilmina) (said: How long have ye tarried) in this Cave after you slept? (They said: We have tarried a day) and when they left the cave and saw that the sun did set yet, they said: (or some part of a day. (Others) said) i.e. Maxmillian: (Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried) after you slept. (Now send one of you) Yamblichus (Yamlikha) (with this your silver coin unto the city) of Ephesus (Afsus), (and let him see what food is purest there) the largest quantity; it is also said that this means: the best of bread and most lawful slaughtered meat (and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous) when buying (and let no man) let no Magian (know of you) find out about you."
