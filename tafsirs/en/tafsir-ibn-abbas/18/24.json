  "text": "(Except if Allah will) unless you second it by saying: if Allah will. (And remember thy Lord) without exception (when thou forgettest) even if it is after a while, (and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me) and lead me (unto a nearer way of truth than this) a more correct and certain way than this. This verse was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) for he said to the idolaters of Mecca when they asked him about the spirit: \" tomorrow, I will answer you \" , and he forgot to say \" if Allah wills \"."
