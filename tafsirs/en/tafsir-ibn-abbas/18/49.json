(And they find all that they did) of good or evil (confronting them) written down, (and thy Lord wrongeth no one) He does not decrease the good deeds of anyone nor increase the evil deeds of anyone; it is also said that this means: He does not diminish the good deeds of the believer nor leave the evil deeds of the unbeliever."
