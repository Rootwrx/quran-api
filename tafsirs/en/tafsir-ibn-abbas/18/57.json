  "text": "(And who doth greater wrong) none is more wrong (than he who hath been reminded of the revelations of his Lord) he who has been admonished with the revelations of his Lord, (yet turneth away from them) in denial (and forgetteth what his hands send forward) and forgets the sins committed by his hands? (Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so that they understand not) the Truth and guidance, (and in their ears a deafness) so that they hear not the Truth and guidance. (And though thou) O Muhammad (call them to the guidance) to Allah's divine Oneness, (in that case they can never be led aright) they will not believe."
