(Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer) they did not respond to them, (and We shall set a gulf of doom between them) We shall set a valley of fire between the worshippers and those who were worshipped; it is also said that this means: We set destruction between them in the Hereafter instead of the love and affection which was between them in the life of this world."
