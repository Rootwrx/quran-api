(But the good deeds which endure) the five daily prayers; it is also said that the reference here is to: that which is lasting in reward. Good deeds include the saying of: \" Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no deity save Allah and Allah is the greatest \" , (are better in thy Lord's sight for reward) for recompense, (and better about hope) the prayer is the best work by means of which the servants can be helpful."
