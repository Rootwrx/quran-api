(He was of the jinn) of the tribe of the jinn, (so he rebelled against his Lord's command) he disobeyed his Lord and refused to prostrate to Adam. (Will ye choose him) will you worship him (and his seed for your protecting friends) as lords (instead of Me) instead of Allah, (when they are an enemy unto you) whose enmity is quite manifest? (Calamitous is the exchange) in worship; it is also said that this means: evil is that which they exchanged: they exchanged the worship of Allah with the worship of Satan; and it is also said: they exchanged the protecting friendship of Allah with the protecting friendship of Satan (for evil-doers) for idolaters!"
