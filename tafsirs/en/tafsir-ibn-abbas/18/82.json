  "text": "(And as for the wall) which I repaired, (it belonged to two orphan boys) called Asram and Suraym (in the city) of Antioch, (and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them) it was a tablet of gold containing knowledge and wisdom and written on it: \ufffdIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I am really amazed regarding a person who believes in death: how could he ever be happy; and amazed at a person who believes in the evanescence of this worldly life and the fluctuation of its people: how he can find tranquillity in it; there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)\ufffd (and their father had been righteous) he was a trustworthy man called Kashih, (and your Lord intended that they should come to their full strength) that they should reach the age of puberty (and should bring forth their treasure) i.e. their golden tablet (as a mercy from their Lord) as a blessing from your Lord; it is also said that this means: as an inspiration from your Lord; (and I did it not upon my own command) I did not do it from my own initiative. (Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear)."
