  "text": "(Lo! We have placed all that is in the earth) of male and female (as an ornament thereof) as an embellishment for the earth (that we may try them) that We may test them: (which of them is best in conduct) which of them is more sincere in works. It is also said that this means: We have made all that which is on earth of plants, trees, beasts, and comfort an ornament for the earth so that We test them which of them is more unattached to, and shunning of, this world."
