  "text": "(And coin for them) explain to the people of Mecca (the similitude of the life of the world) in its permanence and evanescence (as water) as rain (which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it) the water mixes with the vegetation of the earth (and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter) such that nothing remains of it. Likewise, the life of this world will vanish and nothing of its adornment will remain. (Allah is Able to do all things) He is Able to make the life of this world vanish and the Hereafter subsist."
