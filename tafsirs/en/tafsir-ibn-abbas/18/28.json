  "text": "(Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord) who worship their Lord (at morn and evening) the reference here is to Salman al-Farisi and his fellow believers, (seeking His Countenance) by worshipping Him they seek only Allah's Countenance and good pleasure; (and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world) the embellishment of this worldly life; (and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance) of Our divine Oneness, (who followeth his own lust) by worshipping the idols (and whose case) and whose words (hath been abandoned) at a loss. This verse was revealed about 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari."
