  "text": "(And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away) decline (from their cave to the right) the right of the Cave, (and when it set go past them on the left) the left of the Cave, (and they were in the cleft thereof) on a side of the Cave; it is also said that this means: they were in a space which was reached by the light of day. (That) which I have mentioned of their story (was (one) of the portents of Allah) of the marvels of Allah. (He whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (he indeed is led aright) to his religion, (and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend) who might lead him to the guidance."
