  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad: (I am only a mortal like you) I am a human being like you. (My Lord inspireth in me) through Gabriel (that your God is only One God) and He has no son or partner. (And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord) whoever fears resurrection after death, (let him do righteous work) sincerely, and secretly between him and his Lord, (and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord) he should not show off or associate in the worship of his Lord anything or anyone; it is also said that this means: he should not associate in his obedience of his Lord anything or anyone. This verse was revealed about Jundub Ibn Zuhayr al-'Amiri'."
