  "text": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah's saying (Allah hath heard): '(Allah hath heard) He says: Allah heard before He informed you, O Muhammad, (the saying of her that disputeth) that speaks to and argues (with thee (Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah) and entreats Allah, Exalted is He, to explain her matter. (And Allah heareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al-Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by the jinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angry and said: \ufffdif you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just as my mother is\ufffd."
