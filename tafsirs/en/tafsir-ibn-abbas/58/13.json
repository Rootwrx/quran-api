  "text": "When they stopped speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) because of the required almsgiving involved, Allah reproached them for doing so, saying: (Fear ye) are you miserly, O well off people, (to offer alms before your conference) to offer alms to the poor before speaking with the Prophet (pbuh)? (Then, when ye do it not) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in that which He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you. (And Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether it is good or evil. But no one gave alms for speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) except 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib who gave to alms a golden piece which he sold for ten silver pieces, and then asked the Prophet (pbuh) a question of ten words."
