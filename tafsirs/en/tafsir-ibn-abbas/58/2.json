  "text": "(Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers)-They are not their mothers) they are not like their mothers; (none are their mothers) in terms of unmarriageability (except those who gave them birth) or those whose milk they drank in their infancy (they indeed utter an ill word) when they declare their wives unlawful to them, like the unlawfulness of their mothers (and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving) since He did not punish him for declaring unlawful that which Allah made lawful, (Merciful) after he has repented and shown remorse."
