  "text": "(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of creation? (There is no secret conference of three but He is their fourth) except that Allah knows about them, their works and secret conference, (nor of five but He is their sixth) He knows them and knows their secret conference, (nor of less than that or more but He is with them) He knows them and knows their secret conference (wheresoever they may be; and afterward, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did) in the life of the world. (Lo! Allah is Knower of all things) of their works and secret conference. This verse was revealed about Safwan Ibn Umayyah and his son-in-law; their story is mentioned in the Surah of Prostration."
