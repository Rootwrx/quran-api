  "text": "Allah then revealed about Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah, a man from the Yemen, who wrote a letter to the people of Mecca in which he divulged one of the secrets of the Prophet (pbuh) saying: (Thou wilt not find) O Muhammad (folk) i.e. Hatib (who believe in Allah and the Last Day) resurrection after death (loving those who oppose) contravene against (Allah and His messenger) in matters of religion, meaning here the people of Mecca: (even though they be their fathers) blood fathers (or, their sons or their brethren or their clan) or their own folk or relatives. (As for such) Hatib and his fellow believers, (He hath written faith upon their hearts) He cast love of faith in their hearts (and hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him) with a mercy from Him; and it is said this means: He helped them with a help from Him, (and He will bring them into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (wherein they will abide) they will dwell in Paradise for eternity, never to die or leave it. (Allah is well pleased with them) because of their faith, works and repentance, (and they are well pleased with Him) because of the reward and honour they receive from Him. (They are Allah's party) they are Allah's army. (Lo! is it not Allah's party who are the successful?) they are saved from His wrath and chastisement; these are the ones who found and obtained what they were seeking, and were saved from the evil of that which they fled from. Hatib was of those who took part in the Battle of Badr, and his story is found in surah \ufffdShe that is to be examined (al-Mumtahanah)\ufffd."
