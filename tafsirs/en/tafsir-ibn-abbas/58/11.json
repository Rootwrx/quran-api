  "text": "(O ye who believe! When it is said) when the Prophet (pbuh) says: (Make room in assemblies, then make room; Allah will make way for you (Hereafter)) in the Hereafter. This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it was revealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. These people went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah. When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet (pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, he noticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them this verse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along with faith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have no knowledge. This is because a believer who is knowledgeable is better than a believer who is not. (Allah is informed of what ye do) of good or evil."
