Conspiracy) of the hypocrites with the Jews while leaving the true believers aside (is only of the devil) is of the obedience of Satan and by his command, (that he may vex those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; (but he can harm them) secret conference of the hypocrites will not harm the believers (not at all unless by Allah's leave) unless it is by Allah's will. (In Allah let believers put their trust) and let them not put it in other than Him."
