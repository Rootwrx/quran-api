  "surah": 58,
  "ayah": 4,
  "text": "(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa') of wheat or one measure (sa') of barley or dates. (This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: \ufffdYou should free a slave\ufffd. Aws said: \ufffdI have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave\ufffd. The Prophet (pbuh) said: \ufffdThen you should fast two successive months\ufffd. Aws said: \ufffdI cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast\ufffd. The Prophet (pbuh) said: \ufffdThen you should feed 60 needy ones\ufffd. Aws said: \ufffdI can not afford it\ufffd. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: \ufffdI do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I\ufffd. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself."
