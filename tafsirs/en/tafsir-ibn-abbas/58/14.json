They) i.e. the hypocrites (are neither of you) in private such that what is due to you is due to them (nor of them) i.e. the Jews, openly such that whatever is due to the Jews is due to them, (and they swear a false oath) they falsely swear that they are believers and true in their faith (knowingly) while they know they are lying in their oath."
