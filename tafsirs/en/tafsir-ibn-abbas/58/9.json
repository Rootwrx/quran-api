(when ye conspire together) among yourselves, (conspire not together for crime) for lying (and wrong-doing) transgression (and disobedience towards the messenger) by opposing the Messenger like the hypocrites did with the Jews, leaving aside the true believers, (but conspire together for righteousness) for performing the obligations of Allah and for being good towards one another (and pity) shunning transgressions and boycott, (and keep your duty) fear Allah for secret conferencing with other than the true believers, (towards Allah, unto whom ye will be gathered) in the Hereafter."
