It is thy insulter) the one who despises you ((and not thou) who is without posterity) he will be without family, children, wealth or any goodness; he will not be mentioned after his death, i.e. al-'As Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi, while you will be mentioned with every good. This is because, when his son 'Abdullah died, they said: \ufffdMuhammad (pbuh) is without posterity\ufffd.'"
