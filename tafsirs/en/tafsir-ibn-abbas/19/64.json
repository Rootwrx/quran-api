  "text": "(We (angels) come not down) from heaven (save by commandment of thy Lord) O Muhammad. Gabriel said this when Allah withheld the revelation from him for a while after being asked by the Quraysh about the spirit, the two-horned (Dhu'l-Qarnayn) and the people of the Cave. (Unto Him belongeth all that is before us) of the matter of the Hereafter (and all that is behind us) of the matter of this worldly life (and all that is between those two) between the two blowings of the Trumpet, (and thy Lord was never forgetful) your Lord has not forgotten you since He first sent you the Revelation."
