O you who resembles Aaron in worship-Aaron was a righteous man, one of the best among people-; and it is also said that Aaron was an evil man and so they compared her to him; and it is also said that Aaron was her half brother from her father side. (Your father was not a wicked man) your father was not an adulterer (nor was your mother a harlot) nor was your mother a whore."
