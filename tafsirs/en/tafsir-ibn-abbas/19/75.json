  "text": "(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (As for him who is in error) in disbelief and idolatry, (the Beneficent will verily prolong) will increase (his span of life) his wealth and offspring. So observe them, O Muhammad, (until, when they behold that which they were promised) of chastisement, (whether it be punishment (in the world)) on the Day of Badr, by the sword, (or Hour (of Doom)) or the chastisement of the Day of Judgement in hell, (they will know) this is a threat to them (who is worse in position) in the Hereafter and tightness in this worldly life (and who is weaker as, an army) who is weaker in receiving help."
