His name was As'ad Ibn Malkikarb, and his agnomen was Abu Karb and he was called Tubba' because of the huge number of his followers (atba'); he was also a person who surrendered to Allah: (every one) of these folk (denied their messengers) just as your folk, the Quraysh, denied you, (therefore My threat took effect) and therefore My punishment and torment were enjoined upon them when they denied the messengers."
