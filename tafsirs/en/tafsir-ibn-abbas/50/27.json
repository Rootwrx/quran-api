I did not cause him to rebel) \ufffdI did not hasten to record his evil deeds nor did I record that which he has never said or done\ufffd; this will be said when the disbeliever will claim that the angel hastened to write his evil deeds and recorded that which he never said or did. it is also said that his comrade is his devil who will plead with Allah that he did not cause him to rebel or err (but be was (himself) far gone in error) far from the Truth and guidance."
