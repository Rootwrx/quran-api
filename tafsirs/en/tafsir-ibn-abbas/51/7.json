  "text": "(By the heaven full of paths) this is another oath; Allah swears by the seemly and beautiful heaven that has paths; it is also said that full of paths means: it has stars, the sun, the moon; and it is also said that full of paths means: full of waves like those of water upon being hit by the wind, or like the waves of sand upon being blown by the wind, or like the waves of curly hair or the waves of armour made of iron; and it is also said this refers to the seven heaven by which Allah has sworn."
