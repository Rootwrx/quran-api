  "text": "(Then he conceived a fear of them) Abraham concealed his fear of them when they did not eat his food. He thought they were thieves. This is because, in his time, to eat of the food of another person was a sign of coming with a good intention. When the angels realised his fear. (They said: Fear not!) Fear us not, O Abraham! We are the messengers of your Lord (and gave him tidings of (the birth of) a wise son) a son who is wise in his childhood, great when he grows older: this is Isaac."
