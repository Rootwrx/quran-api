  "text": "(And those who govern the event) and He swears by the angels who govern the matters of the slaves, meaning Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death. It is said that (those who govern the event) refers to the spears of soldiers, (the meteors rushing) refers to the ropes of soldiers and (the lone stars floating) refers to the ships of soldiers who fight at sea, (the ones who do the hastening) refers to the horses of soldiers, while (those who govern the event) refers to the generals of soldiers; it is also said that (the lone stars floating) refer to the sun, the moon, the day and the night. Allah swore by all these that the two blowings of the trumpet will take place, with an interval of 40 years separating the two blowings."
