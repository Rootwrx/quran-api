For if he is allowed in the Fire with the Christians, we are also allowed therein with our deities. (They raise not the objection) they do not mention Jesus the son of Mary (save for argument) save for wrangling and dispute. (Nay! but they are a contentious folk) they argue in defence of falsehood."
