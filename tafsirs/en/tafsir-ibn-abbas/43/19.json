(Did they witness their creation) when they were created for them to know that they are females? They said: \ufffdno, O Muhammad, we did not witness their creation but we heard our fathers saying so\ufffd. Allah will say: \ufffdO Muhammad!\ufffd (Their testimony will be recorded) that they lie against Allah when they claim that the angels are Allah's daughters (and they will be questioned) about this claim on the Day of Judgement. In other words, when they claimed that the angels are Allah's daughters, they were asked: \ufffddid you witness their creation?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd \ufffdHow did you then come to the conclusion that the angels are females and Allah's daughters?\ufffd They said: \ufffdWe heard this from our fathers\ufffd. Allah said that their claim about the angels will be recorded and they will be questioned about it on the Day of Judgement."
