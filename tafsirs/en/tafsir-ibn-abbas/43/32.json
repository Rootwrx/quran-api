(We have apportioned among them their livelihood) their wealth and children (in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank) and We raised the merits of some above others in relation to wealth and offspring (that some of them may take labour from others) that some may use others in the capacity of servants and slaves; (and the mercy of thy Lord) i.e. prophethood and Scripture; and it is also said that this means: Paradise for the believers (is better than (the wealth) that they amass) is better than what the disbelievers amass of wealth and adornment in the life of the world."
