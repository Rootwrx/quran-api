  "text": "(And those unto whom they cry) those whom they worship (instead of Him possess no power of intercession) He says: the angels have no power to intercede in favour of anybody, (saving him who beareth witness unto the Truth) the testification that there is no deity save Allah, sincerely believing in it (knowingly) knowing deep in their hearts it is the Truth. This was revealed about the Banu Malih who claimed the angels were the daughters of Allah."
