(And if ye believe) and if you are steadfast in your faith in Allah and His Messenger (and ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, (He will give you your wages) He will give you the reward of your works, (and will not ask of you your worldly wealth) all your worldly wealth to give to charity."
