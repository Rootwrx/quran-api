They asked this question in mockery of what the Prophet (pbuh) had just said. (Those) hypocrites (are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed) such that they do not perceive the Truth or guidance, (and they follow their own lusts) because of their secret disbelief, hypocrisy, treachery and enmity towards the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)."
