  "text": "(While as for those who walk aright) through faith, (He addeth) by means of your sermon (to their guidance) an insight into the matters of religion and sincerity in their intention, (and giveth them their protection) and inspire them their fearingness by shunning transgression and avoiding unlawful matters; it is also said that this means: and those who are guided by the abrogating revelations, Allah increases their guidance in the abrogated revelations and Allah, glorified and Exalted is He, honours them with the use of both the abrogating and the abrogated."
