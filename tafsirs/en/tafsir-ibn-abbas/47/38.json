  "text": "(Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (yet among you there are some who hoard) there are some who refrain from spending in obedience of Allah. (And as for him who hoardeth) and refrains from spending in obedience of Allah, (he hoardeth only from his soul) he is miserly only insofar as reward for, and honour of, his soul are concerned. (And Allah is the Rich) He has no need for your wealth and charity, (and ye are the poor) for Allah's mercy, Paradise and forgiveness. (And if ye turn away) from obeying Allah and obeying His Messenger regarding that which He commands you of spending (He will exchange you for some other folk) He will make you perish and replace you with others who are better and more obedient than you, (and they will not be the likes of you) in relation to transgression and disobedience; rather, they will be better and more obedient than you. It is also said that from Allah's saying (O ye who believe) to the end were revealed about the hypocrites of Asad and Ghatafan, and so Allah replaced them with Juhaynah and Muzaynah who were better and more obedient to Allah'."
