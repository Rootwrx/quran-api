(Obey Allah and obey the messenger) in private, (and render not your actions vain) through hypocrisy, hatred, enmity and opposition of the Messenger; it is also said that this verse was revealed about true believers. Allah says to them: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, obey Allah in that which He commands you of obligations and spending, and obey also the Messenger in that which he commands you of the Sunnah, conquest and Jihad; and do not annul your works through ostentation and seeking fame."
