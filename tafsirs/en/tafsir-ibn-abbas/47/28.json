(Therefore He hath made their actions vain) He annulled the good actions which they performed in their practice of Judaism; and it is also said that the above verses were revealed about the hypocrites who moved from Medina to Mecca because they changed their religion; and it is also said that it was revealed about the hypocrite al-Hakam Ibn Abi al-'As and his host who deliberated on one Friday about taking the leadership of the Muslim community after the Prophet (pbuh) and vowed to spread corruption. They did this while completely ignoring the Prophet who was on the pulpit delivering his sermon. And then, in mockery, asked 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud about what the Prophet (pbuh) said in his sermon."
