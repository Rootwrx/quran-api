  "text": "(And those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, the sincere ones, (say: If only a surah were revealed) if only Gabriel would bring down a surah! They said this out of longing for the remembrance of Allah and wishing to engage in more acts of obedience. (But when a decisive surah is revealed) explaining the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions (and war is mentioned therein) and fighting is commanded therein, (thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease) i.e. doubt and hypocrisy (looking at thee) upon mentioning fighting (with the look of men fainting unto death) as people who are suffering the pangs of death because of their dislike of fighting the enemies. (Therefore woe unto them!) This is a threat to them with Allah's chastisement."
