(Consort with them in the world kindly) with kindness and beneficence, (and follow the path of him who repenteth unto Me) the religion of him who betakes himself to Me and obeys me, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh). (Then unto Me will be your return) and the return of your parents, (and I shall tell you what ye used to do) of good or evil."
