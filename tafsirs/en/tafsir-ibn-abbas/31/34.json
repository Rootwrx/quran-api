(He sendeth down the rain) He knows when the rain comes down but this is hidden from people, (and knoweth that which is in the wombs) whether it is a male or female, felicitous or damned while this is hidden from the servants. (No soul knoweth what it will earn tomorrow) of good or evil while this is hidden from the servants, (and no soul knoweth in what land it will die) in what manner it will die because it is hidden from the servants. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of His creation, (Aware) of their works and of what touches them of benefit or harm'."
