  "text": "(And if a wave enshroudeth them like awnings) like the clouds in their tremendousness, (they cry unto Allah, making their faith pure for Him only. But when He bringeth them safe to land, some of them) some of the disbelievers (compromise) in their speech and works, such that they are softer than they were. (None denieth Our signs) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (save every traitor ingrate) who disbelieves in Allah and is ungrateful for His bounties."
