(His mother beareth him) in her womb (in weakness upon weakness) and hardship upon hardship, the more the child grows in her womb the harder it is for her, (and his weaning is in two years. Give thanks unto Me) through believing in My divine Oneness and by obeying Me (and unto thy parents) by looking after them. (Unto Me is the journeying) your destination and the destination of your parents."
