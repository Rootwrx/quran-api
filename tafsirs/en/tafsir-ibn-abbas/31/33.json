(Keep your duty to your Lord) obey your Lord (and fear a Day) fear the torment of a day (when the parent will not be able to avail the child in aught) in relation to Allah's chastisement, (nor the child to avail the parent. Lo! Allah's promise) resurrection after death (is the very truth) will truly take place. (Let not the life of the world) the comfort and adornment of the life of this world (beguile you, nor let the deceiver) Satan; it is also said this means: falsehoods (beguile you, in regard to Allah."
