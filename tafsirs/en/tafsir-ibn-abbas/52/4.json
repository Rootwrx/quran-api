There is between it and the Ka'bah, through the borderline of the seventh earth, a Sacred Precinct which is visited every single day by 70,000 angels who never return to visit it. This is the House that Adam built and was raised to the seventh heaven because of the flood, it is called al-dirah and is opposite of the Ka'bah."
