  "text": "(And slay not the life) of a believing person (which Allah hath forbidden) to slay (save with right) through stoning, application of the law of retaliation or because of apostasy. (Whoso is slain wrongfully) and intentionally, (We have given power) a cause and pretext against the killer, if he wishes he can kill him and if he wishes he can spare him, and if he wishes he can take blood money instead (unto his heir) the heir of the victim, (but let him not commit excess in slaying) if he kills the killer of the victim. Thus, he should not kill other than the killer himself; it is also said that this means, according to another reading: do not kill ten people to avenge the killing of one person. (Lo! he will be helped) for in that case, he will be killed and cannot be spared."
