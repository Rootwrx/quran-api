(Then We make dark the portent of the night) the light of the sign of the night, i.e. the moon, (and We make) and leave (the portent of the day) i.e. the sun (sight giving) bright and clear, (that ye may seek bounty from your Lord) the bounty of this worldly life and that of the Hereafter, (and that ye may know) and that you may know through the increase and decrease of the phases of the moon (the computation of the years and the reckoning) how to count days and months; (and everything) the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and prohibitions (have We exposited with a clear expositing) We have clearly explained it in the Qur'an."
