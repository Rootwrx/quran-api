  "text": "(And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck) let your hand not refrain from spending and giving gifts as would the person whose hand is chained to his neck (nor open it) in spending and giving gifts (with a complete opening) in spendthriftness. He says: do not give everything you have to one needy person or to one relative and leave all the rest, (lest thou sit down) lest you remain (rebuked) reproached by the needy and kinsmen, (denuded) cut off from kinsmen and the needy, without any wealth left. It is also said that this verse was revealed about a woman who asked for the shirt of the Prophet (pbuh). The latter took his shirt off, gave it to her and remained with his top bare. So Allah forbade him from doing so, telling him: do not open your hand completely when spending to the extent that you take off your shirt and give it away, and thus remain naked and blamed by people for remaining naked."
