(And We gave Thamud the she-camel) We gave the people of Salih a pregnant she-camel (a clear portent) a clear sign for the prophethood of Salih (but they did wrong about her) they denied the sign and killed her. (We send not portents) signs (save to warn) from torment, for We destroy them if they do not believe in them."
