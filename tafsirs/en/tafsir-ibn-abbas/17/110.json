His are the most beautiful names) the most sublime attributes such as knowledge, power, hearing, sight; so call Him by using them. (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud voiced in thy worship) do not be too loud in your recitation of the Qur'an during prayer so that the idolaters do not harm you (nor yet silent therein) such that your Companions cannot hear you, (but follow a way between) a middle ground between loud and silent recitation."
