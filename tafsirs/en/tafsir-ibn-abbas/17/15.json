  "text": "(Whosoever goeth right) whosoever believes, (it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth right) the reward for his belief will go to himself, (and whosoever erreth) and whoever disbelieves, (erreth only to its hurt) the punishment for his disbelief will be against his soul. (No laden soul can bear another's load) no soul laden with sin shall bear another person's sins with a good disposition of the soul, but rather she will bear them through retaliation; it is also said that this means: no soul will be punished for the sins committed by another soul; and it is also said that this means: no soul shall be chastised for the sins of another. (We never punish) a folk by causing their destruction (until We have sent) to them (a messenger) in order to establish a proof against them."
