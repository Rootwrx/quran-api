(Cause me to come in with a firm incoming) he says: cause me to come to Medina with a firm incoming, he said this when he was leaving Medina (and to go out) of Medina (with a firm outgoing) after staying there and cause me to enter Mecca; it is also said that this means: cause me to come in the grave with a firm incoming, and cause me to come out of the grave on the Day of Judgement with a firm outgoing. (And give me from Your presence) from You (a sustaining Power) a help that is free of abasement or rejection."
