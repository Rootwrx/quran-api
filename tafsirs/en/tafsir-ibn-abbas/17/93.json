  "text": "(Or thou have a house of gold) and silver; (or thou ascend up into heaven) and bring with you the angel to testify that you are Allah's messenger to us, (and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension) to heaven (till thou bring down for us a book) from Allah to us (that we can read) in which we find that you are Allah's messenger to us. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord be glorified!) I exonerate my Lord from having a son or partner, (Am I naught save a mortal messenger?) he says: I am only a human messenger, like all previous messengers."
