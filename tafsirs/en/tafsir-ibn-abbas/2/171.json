  "text": "Allah then gave a similitude regarding the unbelievers vis-\ufffd-vis Muhammad (pbuh) saying: (The likeness of those who disbelieve) vis-\ufffd-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth nothing) just like camels and sheep with their shepherd: his speech is unintelligible to them when he says to them, for example, eat or drink (except a shout and a cry. Deaf) concerning the Truth, (dumb) regarding the Truth, (blind) to guidance; i.e. they pretend to be deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to the Truth and guidance, (therefore they have no sense) they do not understand Allah's command and the call of the Prophet (pbuh) just as camels and cattle do not comprehend the words of their shepherd."
