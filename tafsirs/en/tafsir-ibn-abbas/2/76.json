(But when they go apart one with another) when these lowly people return to their leaders (they say) the leaders say to the lowly: (Prate ye to them) i.e. Muhammad and his Companions (of that which Allah hath disclosed to you) about that which Allah has shown you regarding the description and traits of Muhammad in your Book (so that they may contend with you) argue against you (before your Lord concerning it? Have ye then no sense?) do you not have any common sense?"
