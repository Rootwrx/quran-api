(The unthinking man) the person who does not know them (accounteth them wealthy due to their restraint) because of their attire. (Thou shalt know them) O Muhammad! (by their mark) by their clothing: (They do not beg of men with importunity) He says: they neither beg with importunity nor without it. (And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the people of the Ledge, (lo! Allah knoweth it) Allah knows your wealth as well as your intentions."
