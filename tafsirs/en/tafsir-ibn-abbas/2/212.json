(But those who ward off) disbelief and ascribing partners to Allah: i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (will be above them) in this world by having a strong argument against them and also by having status and standing (on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth) abundant wealth (without stint) without faltering or affectation; it is also said that He gives to whoever He wills in Paradise without stint (to whom He will)."
