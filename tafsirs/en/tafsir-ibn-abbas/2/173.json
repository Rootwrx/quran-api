  "text": "Then Allah exposited what He made unlawful for them, saying: (He hath forbidden you only carrion) which He has commanded to immolate, (and blood) and shed blood, (and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to any other than Allah) that which is offered as sacrifice purposefully in any other thing than the Name of Allah, i.e. to idols. (But he who is driven by necessity) compelled to eat carrion (neither craving) neither rebelling nor declaring it lawful (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery nor purposefully eating it without being driven by necessity, (it is no sin for him) then such a person, who is compelled to eat it without having his fill and without taking anything with him, has not transgressed. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) that he ate more than he needs to preserve himself, (Merciful) when He gave him legal dispensation to eat carrion."
