Those who hide anything of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed) what Allah has exposited in the Torah regarding the description and traits of Muhammad, (and purchase) by concealing this (a small gain therewith) a small profit, this was revealed about Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab (they eat into their bellies) they put into their bellies (nothing else than fire) except the unlawful; and it is also said that this means: they eat nothing except that which will turn into fire in their bellies on the Day of Judgement. (And Allah will not speak to them) nicely (on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them pure) He will not absolve them of their transgressions; it is also said that this means: He will not commend them in any good way. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a painful torment that will extend to their hearts."
