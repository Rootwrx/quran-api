(But if they turn away) refuse to believe in all the prophets and their Scriptures, (then are they in schism) in conflict with the true religion, (and Allah will suffice thee (for defence) against them) Allah will lift their burden from you, by killing and expelling them. (And He is the Hearer) of what they say, (the Knower) of their punishment."
