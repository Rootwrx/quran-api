  "text": "(And when Abraham) also (said: My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead) how you gather the bones of the dead again, (He said: Dost thou not believe?) are you not convinced? (Abraham said: Yea) I am convinced, (but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease) in order that the heat of my heart abates and so that I know that I am your friend and that my prayers are answered. ((His Lord) said: Take four of the birds) of different kinds: a cockerel, a raven, a duck and a peacock (and cause them to incline unto you) cut them into pieces, (then place a part of them on each hill) four different hills, (then call them) by their names, (they will come to thee) walking (in haste). (And know) O Abraham! (that Allah is Mighty) for He is vengeful against those who do not believe in bringing the dead back to life, (Wise) He gathers the bones of the dead and bring them back to life, just as He gathered these birds and brought them back to life."
