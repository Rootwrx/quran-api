Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you) of the lawful things We have given you, (and render thanks to Allah) for it (if it is (indeed) He whom ye worship) it is also said that this means: if you really intend to worship Allah by declaring these to be unlawful, then do not declare them unlawful, for to worship Allah entails that you declare them to be lawful."
