  "text": "Allah then mentions His covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: (And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: Worship none save Allah) declare Him as the only true God and do not ascribe any partner to Him, (and be good to parents) be dutiful to them (and to kindred) and keep contact with relatives (and to orphans) and be kind to orphans (and the needy) and generous to the needy, (and speak kindly to mankind) say the Truth regarding Muhammad (pbuh); (and establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) and give from your wealth what is due to the poor. (Then, after that, ye slid back) you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that this refers to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside."
