  "text": "(We said) to Adam, Eve, the serpent, the peacock and Satan: (Go down) from heaven, (all of you). Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned Adam's progeny, (from hence; but verily there cometh unto you), when and whenever it comes to you, (from Me a guidance), a scripture and an emissary; (whoso followeth My guidance) the scripture and the emissary, (there shall no fear come upon them) regarding any torment in the future, (neither shall they grieve) about what they have left behind them. It is also said that this means that no fear will come upon them perpetually and nor will they grieve perpetually; no fear will come upon them when death is slain and they will not grieve when hell is closed."
