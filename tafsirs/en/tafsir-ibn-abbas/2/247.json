  "text": "(The Prophet) Samuel (said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up) identified (Saul to be king for you. They said: How can) it be justified that (he have kingdom over us) for he is not of royal descent (when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is) for we are of royal descent, (since he hath not been given wealth enough) to spend on the army? (He) Samuel (said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him) to be king and sovereign (above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom) the knowledge of warfare (and stature) size and physical strength. (Allah bestoweth His sovereignty on whom he will) in this life even if he is not of royal descent. (Allah is All-Embracing) in His gift, (All-Knowing) about whom He gives to, because they said to their prophet that it was he who chose Saul rather than his being appointed by Allah."
