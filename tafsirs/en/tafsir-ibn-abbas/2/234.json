And when they reach the term (prescribed for them)) when they complete their waiting period (then there is no sin for you) for the relatives of the deceased (in aught that they may do with themselves) in terms of making themselves attractive (in decency) for the purpose of remarrying. (And Allah is Informed of what ye do) whether it is good or evil."
