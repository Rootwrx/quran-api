  "text": "(Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward) He says: return from whence the people of Yemen have returned, (and ask forgiveness of Allah) for your sins. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent, (Merciful) towards those who die in a state of repentance. This was revealed about a group of people called the \ufffdHamsiyyun\ufffd who did not want to press on from the Inviolable Place of Worship to 'Arafat during their pilgrimage. Allah warned them against this, commanding them to go to 'Arafat and then return from there."
