  "text": "(And if ye do not) if you do not abstain from usury, (then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His Messenger) then be ready for a torment from God in the Hereafter by means of the Fire and its chastisement and also be ready for the sword from His Messenger in the life of this world. (And if ye repent) from usury, (then ye have your principal (without interest)) that is owed to you by the Banu Makhzum. (Wrong not) anyone by demanding interest, (and ye shall not be wronged) by anyone if they give you back your capitals; it is also said that 'wrong not' means: do not harm others; and 'you shall not be wronged' meaning: you shall not be harmed because of your debts."
