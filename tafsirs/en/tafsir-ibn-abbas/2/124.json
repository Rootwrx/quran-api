  "text": "Allah then mentioned His favour upon Abraham, His close friend, saying: (And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words) He commanded him to fulfil ten traits: five in relation to his head and five to his body, (and he fulfilled them) he complied. It is also said that (And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words) means: with every single word he prayed to Allah, (He said) to him: (Lo! I have appointed you a leader for mankind) a vicegerent that people may emulate you. (He) Abraham (said: And of my offspring) make of my offspring vicegerents that people would emulate? (He) Allah (said: My covenant) with you and My promise to you and the honour and mercy I bestowed upon you (includeth not wrong-doers) from among your offspring; it is also said that this means: My covenant will not include the wrong-doers in the Hereafter but it will include them in this life."
