  "text": "(And whoso changeth) the will of the deceased person (after he hath heard it-the sin thereof) the onus thereof (is only upon those who change it) and the deceased bears no responsibility. (For Allah is Hearer) of the will and words of the deceased, (Knower) if he transgresses or changes it; it is also said that this means: He knows the deed of the testator. Thus, out of fear of sin, people used to execute the will of a deceased person as it was even when the latter transgressed in that will,"
