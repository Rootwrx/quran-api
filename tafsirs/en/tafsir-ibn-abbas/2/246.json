(He said: Would ye then) do you suppose then that you will (refrain from fighting if fighting) against your enemy (were prescribed for you?) made obligatory upon you. (They said: why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been expelled from our dwellings) from our homes (and separated from our children) who were taken as slaves? (Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them) was made obligatory upon them, (they turned away) they refrained from fighting their enemy, (all save a few of them) 313 men. (And Allah is Aware of evil-doers) who shy away from fighting their enemy."
