  "text": "(O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you) for a specific number of days; it is said that this means: fasting is prescribed for you: you abstain from eating and drinking and from sexual intercourse from the dawn prayer or from the time one sleeps before the dawn prayer, (even as it was prescribed for those before you) for the people of the Book, (that ye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off eating, drinking and sexual intercourse after the last night prayer or before sleeping after the last night prayer. However, this is abrogated by the verses: (It is made lawful for you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast) and (and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn)."
