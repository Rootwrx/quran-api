  "text": "Then He mentioned the sign of His divine Oneness, saying: (Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth) i.e. in their making; or as it is said: in the making of what is in them, (and the difference of night and day) in the alternation of night and day, and in the increase and decrease of their duration, (and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men) in their livelihoods, (and the water) rain (which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving) through rain (the earth after its death) after suffering by drought and being dried up, (and dispersing) creating (all kinds of beasts) male and female (therein, and the ordinance of the winds) in changing the direction of the wind towards the right and towards the left, coming sometimes from the East and sometimes from the West, sometimes carrying torment and sometimes mercy: (and the clouds obedient) subservient (between heaven and earth) He says: in all these (are signs) indications of the Lord's divine Oneness (for people who have sense) who believe that they are from Allah."
