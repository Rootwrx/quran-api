  "text": "(Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you), a place for dwelling and sleeping, (and the sky a canopy), raised high above; (and causeth water to pour down from the sky), i.e. rain, (thereby producing) through this rain (fruits) different kinds of fruit (as food for you) as sustenance for you and all created beings. (So do not set up rivals to Allah) do not say that Allah has peers, different forms or coequals (when you know) that He is the fashioner of all these things. It is also said that (when you know) means: when you know from your own scripture that Allah does not have a son, coequal or peer."
