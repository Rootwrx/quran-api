  "text": "(The foolish of the people) the ignorant among the Jews and Arab idolaters (will say: What hath turned them) made them change (from the Qiblah which they formerly observed) except that they want to revert to the religion of their ancestors; it is also said that this means: there was no reason to turn from the direction in which they prayed, i.e. Jerusalem? (Say) O Muhammad! (unto Allah belong the East) praying to the Ka'bah (and the West) the prayer that you prayed in the direction of Jerusalem-both are with Allah's command. (He guideth whom He will unto a straight path) He confirms whom He wills on a straight Religion and direction of prayer."
