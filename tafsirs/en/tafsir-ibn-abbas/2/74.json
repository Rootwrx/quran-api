  "text": "(Then, even after that) after bringing 'Amil back to life and informing you about his murderer, (your hearts were hardened) dry and barren (and became as rocks, or worse than rock, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are some which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And indeed there are some which fall down) from the top of mountains to the bottom (for the fear of Allah) but your hearts are not moved by fear of Allah. (Allah is not unaware of) will not leave unpunished (what ye do) of transgressions; and it is said the meaning is: what you hide of transgression."
