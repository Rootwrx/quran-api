  "text": "(And if they decide upon divorce) have actually divorced and honoured their oaths ((let them remember that) Allah is Hearer) of one's oath, (Knower) of the fact that one's wife has been divorced through one single pronouncement of divorce after a period of fourth months and through honouring the oath that was made. This verse was revealed about a man who swore not to have sex with his wife for four months or longer. If this man had honoured his oath, his wife would have been considered divorced from him, one single act of divorce; if, on the other hand, he had sex with her before the elapse of this period, he should make amends for breaking his oath."
