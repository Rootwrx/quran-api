  "text": "Allah then mentions the believers' dislike of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah in front of the idols which were placed there, saying: (Lo! Al-Safa and al-Marwah) going around al-Safa and al-Marwah (are among the rites of Allah) among the rites of pilgrimage that Allah, Exalted is He, has commanded. (It is therefore no sin) one commits no transgression (for him who is on pilgrimage to the House or visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his own accord) and whoever performs extra works other than this obligation of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah, (Lo! Allah is Responsive) accepts such works, (Aware) of your intentions; it is also said that this means: Allah accepts the smallest of your works and His reward is abundant."
