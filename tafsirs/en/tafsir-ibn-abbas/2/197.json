  "text": "(The pilgrimage is (in) the well known months) ritual consecration for the pilgrimage takes place in the well known months of Shawwal, Dhu'l-Qa'da, and the first ten days of Dhu'l-Hijja, (and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein) whoever enters in a state of ritual consecration in these months (there is (to be) no lewdness) no sexual intercourse once in a state of ritual consecration (nor abuse) no verbal abuse or name calling (nor angry conversation) between one person and another (on the pilgrimage) when in a state of ritual consecration; it is also said that this means: there is to be no heated argument about the obligatoriness of the pilgrimage. (And whatsoever good ye do) whatever you abstain from whether it is lewdness, abuse or angry conversation in the Sacred Precinct (Allah knoweth it) Allah will accept it. (So make provision for yourselves) O people of sound minds, from the provision of this world; Allah says here: take from the provisions of this world, O people of sound minds, what is enough to spare you from asking others, otherwise just trust in Allah; (for the best provision to ward off evil) for trust in Allah is the best provision in this world. (Therefore keep your duty unto Me) fear Me in the Sacred Precinct, (O men of understanding). This verse was revealed about some people from the Yemen who used to perform the pilgrimage without taking any provisions with them. As a consequence, they used to wrongfully obtain provisions from the settlements they found on their way and hence Allah now prohibited them from doing so."
