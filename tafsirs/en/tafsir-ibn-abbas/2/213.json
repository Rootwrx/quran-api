  "text": "(Mankind were) in the times of Noah and Abraham (one community) of disbelievers; as it is said that this means: there were in the time of Abraham followers of the true Religion (Muslims), (and Allah sent Prophets) from the children of Noah and Abraham (as bearers of good tidings) of Paradise for whoever believes in Allah (and as warners) from hell for whoever does not believe in Allah, (and revealed therewith the Scripture) He sent down Gabriel to them with the Scripture, (with the Truth) expositing what is true and what is false (that it might judge) so that each prophet would judge by his Scripture (between mankind concerning that wherein they differed) in Religion; it is also said that this means: so that the Scripture is used as a final authority; and it is also said that this means: so that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) rules them by the Scripture. (And only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it) concerning the Religion and Muhammad (pbuh) (after clear proofs had come unto them) clear proofs from their own Scripture, (through hatred one of another) out of resentful envy from their part and this is why they disbelieved in it. (And Allah by His will guided those who believe) by means of the prophets (unto the Truth of that concerning which they differed) in Religion. It is also said that this means: Allah protected the believers by means of the prophets from that which they differed over in matters of Religion, and directed them from falsehood to the Truth. (Allah guideth whom He will) whomever deserves it; and it is also said that this means: Allah holds firm whomever He wills by His grace and will (unto a straight path) unto an established religion that He is pleased with."
