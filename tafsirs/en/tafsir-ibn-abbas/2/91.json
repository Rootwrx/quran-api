(And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it) other than the Torah, (though it is the Truth) i.e. the Qur'an is the Truth (confirming) affirming the Oneness of Allah (that which they possess) of the Book. They said: \" O Muhammad! Our forefathers were believers \". (Say) O Muhammad!: (Why then slew ye the Prophets of Allah before, if ye are (indeed) believers?) if your claims are truthful."
