  "text": "(Of those messengers) whom We have named for you, (some of whom We have caused to excel others) by bestowing honour upon them, (and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake) this is Moses, (while some of them He exalted (above others) in degrees) this is Abraham whom Allah took as a friend, and Enoch whom Allah raised to an elevated place; (and We gave Jesus son of Mary clear proofs) commands, prohibitions and the working of marvels (and We supported him) strengthened and assisted him (with the holy Spirit) with Gabriel, the pure. (And if Allah had so willed it, those who followed after them) after Moses and Jesus (would not have fought one with another) differed with one another (after clear proofs had come unto them) the exposition in their Scriptures of the description and traits of Muhammad. (But they differed) in the matter of Religion, (some of them believing) in every Scripture and Messenger (and some disbelieving) in the Scriptures and messengers. (And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with another) they would not have differed with one another in the matter of the religion; (but Allah doeth what He will) with His servants."
