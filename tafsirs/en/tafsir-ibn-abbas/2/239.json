(And when ye are again in safety) from the enemy, (remember Allah) pray to Allah performing the bowings and prostrations, (as He hath taught you) in the Qur'an: the traveller prays two units of prayer while the resident prays four units (that which ye knew not) before the revelation of the Qur'an."
