  "text": "(Who believe in the unseen), that which is hidden from them such as Paradise, hell, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, the Resurrection, the Reckoning, etc. It is also said that this means: that they believe in the unseen which is revealed in the Qur'an and also in that which is not revealed therein. It is also said that the unseen is Allah Himself. (And establish worship), they perform to completion the five prescribed prayers, including the ablution that precedes them, the bowing and prostrations which are parts of them and also what is obligated in these prayers in terms of appointed timing. (And spend of that We have bestowed upon them), and of that which We have given them of wealth they give to charity. It is also said that this means: they give the poor-due (Zakat) from their wealth. The reference here is to Abu Bakr and his companions."
