  "text": "(And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam), a prostration of salutation, (they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride) to follow his Lord's command. (And so became a disbeliever) after this because he refused to comply with Allah's command. It is also said that it was in Allah's foreknowledge that Satan was to become a disbeliever; as it is said that he was the first unbeliever ever."
