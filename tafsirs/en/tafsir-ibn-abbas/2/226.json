  "text": "(Those who forswear their wives) those who abstain from having sex with their wives because of an oath they have made, should not touch them for a period of four months (may wait up to four months) they should wait four months; (then, if they change their mind) if they have sex with them before the elapse of four months, (lo! Allah is Forgiving) that they have not honoured their oath, provided they repent, (Merciful) in that He made the amends due on them clear."
