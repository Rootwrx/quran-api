(Verily We chose him) i.e. Abraham (in the world) by taking him as a friend; as it is said this means: We have chosen him in this world by bestowing upon him prophethood, Islam and goodly offspring, (and lo! In the Hereafter he is among the righteous ones) with his forefathers, the messengers, in Paradise."
