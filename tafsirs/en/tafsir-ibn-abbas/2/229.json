  "text": "(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wife both know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves."
