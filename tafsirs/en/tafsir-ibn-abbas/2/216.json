  "text": "(Warfare is ordained for you) in times of a general call to arms with the Prophet (pbuh) (though it is hateful unto you) hard on you; (but it may happen that ye hate a thing) fighting in the way of Allah (which is good for you) in that you obtain martyrdom and spoils, (and it may happen that ye love a thing) abstaining from fighting in the way of Allah (which is bad for you) in that you will not obtain martyrdom or spoils. (And Allah knoweth) that fighting in His way is better for you, (ye know not) that abstention from fighting in His way is bad for you. This was revealed about Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas, al-Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad and their associates. It was then revealed regarding 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions who killed 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami and their asking about warfare during the sacred month-in reference here to Rajab: i.e. the last afternoon of Jumada II, before seeing the moon of Rajab-for the unbelievers had censored them from doing so."
