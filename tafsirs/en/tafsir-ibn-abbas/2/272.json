  "text": "Then Allah gave dispensation to give alms to the poor among the idolaters and the people of the Book. Asma' the daughter of Abu Bakr, or Asma' the daughter of Abu'l-Nadir asked the Prophet: O Messenger of Allah! Is it permissible to give alms to our relatives who do not follow our Religion? Allah answered His Prophet by saying: (The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad)) it is not your duty to guide to Religion the poor from among the people of the Book, (but Allah guideth whomever He will) to His religion. (And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor, (it is for yourselves) its reward is for yourselves, (when ye spend) on the poor do (not) do so (save in search of Allah's Countenance) except in seeking Allah's pleasure; (and whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the folk of the Platform, (it will be repaid to you in full) the reward of it will be saved for you in the Hereafter, (and ye will not be wronged) your reward shall not be diminished and your sins will not be increased."
