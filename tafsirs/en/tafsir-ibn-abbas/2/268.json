  "text": "(The devil promiseth you destitution) makes you scared of poverty upon spending in charity (and enjoineth on you lewdness) by not giving the poor-due. (But Allah promiseth you forgiveness) of your sins for giving the poor-due (from Himself with bounty) with something in exchange as well as a reward in the Hereafter. (Allah is All-Embracing) in that He replaces what you spend and also forgives sins, (All-Knowing) of your intentions and spending."
