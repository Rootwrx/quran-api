  "text": "(Upon the world and the Hereafter) that it is lasting. (And they question thee concerning orphans). This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who asked the Prophet (pbuh) about whether it was lawful to share food, drink and shelter with orphans. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about sharing food, drink and shelter with orphans, (Say) O Muhammad: (To improve their lot) and their wealth (is best) rather than not sharing with them. (And if you mingle your affairs with theirs) as regards food, drink and shelter, (then (they are) your brothers) in Religion and you should therefore safeguard their shares. (And Allah knoweth him who spoileth) the wealth of orphans (from him who improveth) their wealth. (Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you) He could have forbidden such sharing. (Indeed Allah is Mighty) and takes revenge against whoever spoils the wealth of orphans, (Wise) ruling that the wealth of orphans should be improved."
