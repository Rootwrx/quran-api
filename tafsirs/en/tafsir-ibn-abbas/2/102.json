  "text": "The Jews left the guidance of all the prophets (And they followed that which the devils falsely related) they acted upon what the devils had written (against the kingdom of Solomon) about the collapse of Solomon's kingdom, and 40 days of sorcery and white magic. (Solomon disbelieved not) did not write this sorcery and white magic; (but the devils disbelieved) did write it, (teaching mankind) the devils taught people, as it is said that the Jews taught people (magic and that which was revealed to the two angels) but the angels were not taught sorcery and white magic; and it is said that this means: they also taught what the angels were inspired with (in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they teach it to anyone) nor did the angels describe anything to anyone (till they had said) at the outset: (We are only a temptation) we have been tried with calling people to this in order that we reduce the intensity of the torment inflicted on ourselves, (therefore disbelieve not) do not learn or act upon it. (And from these two (angels) people learn) without being taught by them (that by which they cause division between man and wife) that by which a man finds excuse to leave his wife; (but they injure thereby) with sorcery and causing rift (no one save by Allah's leave) except through Allah's will and with His knowledge. (And they learn) the devils, the Jews and sorcerers learn from each other (that which harms them) in the Hereafter (and profits them not) in this world or the next. (And surely they do know) this refers to the angels, and it is said that it refers to the Jews in their Book, as it is said that his refers to the devils (that he who trafficketh therein) chooses sorcery and white magic (will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise; (and surely evil is the price for which they sold their souls) by choosing sorcery for themselves, and the reference here is to the Jews, (if they but knew) but they do not know; and it is said that this means: and they did know this from their own Book."
