Those who believe) in Allah, His messengers, scriptures as well as in the unlawfulness of usury (and do good works) regarding what is between them and their Lord and avoid usury (and establish worship) complete the five daily prayers with all that which is obligated in them (and pay the poor-due) and give the poor-due of their wealth, (their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise (and there shall no fear come upon them) when death is slain (neither shall they grieve) when the Fire is closed."
