  "text": "(If ye be on a journey and you cannot find a scribe) or the means by which to write, (then a pledge in hand (shall suffice)) then let the creditor take from the indebted person a security for his loan. (And if one of you entrusteth another) to give a loan without security (let him who is trusted) with the debt (deliver up that which is entrusted to him) the right of his creditor (and let him observe his duty to Allah, his Lord.) the debtor should fear Allah regarding repayment of his debt, (Hide not testimony) from the judges in court. (He who hideth it) i.e. his testimony, (surely his heart is sinful) his heart is impious. (Allah is Aware of what ye do) in relation to hiding or giving testimony."
