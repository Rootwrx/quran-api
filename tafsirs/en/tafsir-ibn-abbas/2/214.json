(Affliction) fear, calamities, hardships (and adversity) sickness, pain and hunger (befell them) visited them, (they were shaken as with an earthquake) in hardship, (till the Messenger (of Allah)) until their Messenger (and those who believed along with him) those who believed in him (said: When cometh Allah's help) over the enemy? Allah said to that Prophet: (Now surely Allah's help) over your enemy by means of your safety (is near)."
