  "text": "(And when Moses asked for water for his people) in the wilderness, (We said: smite with your staff the rock) that you have with you. This was a rock given to him by Allah. It had 12 nipples that resemble the nipples of women and upon striking each one of these a spring gushed therefrom. (And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking place) each tribe knew their own spring. Allah said to them: (Eat) the honey and quails (and drink of) all the springs (that which Allah hath provided. And do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth) and do not cause mischief on the earth, or act contrary to what Moses commanded."
