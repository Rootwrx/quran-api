  "text": "(They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation) this was revealed about Abu'l-Dahdah who asked the Prophet (pbuh) about it. Allah said to His Prophet: they ask you about sexual intercourse during menstruation, (Say) O Muhammad: (it is harmful) it is filth and unlawful, (so keep away from women at such time) so refrain from having sexual intercourse during menstruation (and go not unto them) do not have sex with them (till they are cleansed) of menstruation. (And when they have purified themselves) and have had a major ritual ablution (ghusl), (then go in unto them) you may have sex with them (as Allah hath enjoined upon you) as you were dispensed to do before, i.e. penetration ought to be in the pudendum. (Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him) those who repent of transgression (and loveth those who have a care for cleanness) those who have a care for turning away from transgression and filth."
