  "text": "(It is made lawful for you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast) for sexual intercourse. (They are raiment for you) a repose for you (and you are raiment for them) a repose for them. (Allah is aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect) by having sexual intercourse with them at night (and He hath turned in mercy towards you) He forgave you (and relieved you) from your deception and did not punish you. (So) now that it is made lawful, (hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you) to have a righteous child; this verse was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, (and eat and drink) from the time the night falls (until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn) i.e. until the light of day becomes distinct to you from the darkness of night. (Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall) the beginning of nightfall; this verse was revealed about Sirmah Ibn Malik Ibn 'Adiyy (and touch them not) do not have sexual intercourse with them, (while you are at your devotions) in pious retreat (in the mosques) whether this is during the day or the night. (These are the limits imposed by Allah) such sexual intercourse is a transgression against Allah, (so approach them not) abstain from having sexual intercourse with your wives, during the day and at night, while you are in such retreats. (Thus Allah expoundeth His revelations) His commands and prohibitions (to mankind) as He has exposited this matter (that they may ward off (evil)) they may ward off transgressing against Him. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) among whom were 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib and 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, who were in retreat in the mosque and used to go to their wives whenever they needed them, and then take a ritual bath and return to the mosque. Henceforth but they were forbidden to do so."
