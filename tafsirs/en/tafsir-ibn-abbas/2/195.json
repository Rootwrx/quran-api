  "text": "(Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah so as to perform the lesser pilgrimage, (and be not cast by your own hands to ruin) Allah says: do not refrain from giving in His cause lest you ruin yourselves. It is also said that this means: do not be the cause of your own ruin; and it is also said that this means: do not despair of Allah's mercy lest you ruin yourselves; (and do good) by spending in the cause of Allah; it is also said that this means: have a good opinion about Allah; and it is also said that this means: be good in your spending in the way of Allah. (Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent) who spend in His cause. The verses from (Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you) to (and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent) were revealed about the Companions who were in ritual consecration with the Prophet (pbuh) on their way to perform the lesser pilgrimage after the year of al-Hudaybiyyah."
