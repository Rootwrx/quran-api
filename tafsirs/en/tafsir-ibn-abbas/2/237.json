  "text": "Then Allah exposited on the legal ruling of she whose dowry had been specified, saying: (And if ye divorce them before ye have touched them) before you have had sexual intercourse with them (and ye have appointed unto them a portion) you have specified a dowry for them, (then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed) half of the dowry you specified, (unless they (the women) agree to forgo it) unless the woman forgoes her right and leaves it to the husband, (or he agreeth to forgo it in whose is the marriage tie), or the husband forgoes his right and gives the woman her full dowry. (To forgo) your rights (is nearer to piety) is nearer to piety for the God-fearing. Allah says here to the husband and wife: it is more conducive to God-fearing if you forgo your right to the other; (And forget not kindness among yourselves) Allah says to both: continue to be kind and generous to each other. (Indeed Allah is Seer of what ye do) of acts of kindness and generosity."
