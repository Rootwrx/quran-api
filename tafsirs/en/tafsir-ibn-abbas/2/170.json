  "text": "(And when it is said unto them) to the Arab idolaters: (Follow that which Allah hath revealed) follow the lawfulness exposited by Allah concerning what is cultivated and the cattle raised, (they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers) regarding their unlawfulness. (What! Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent) with regard to Religion (and had no guidance) to the practice of any prophet, so how could you follow them? It is also said that this means: if their fathers did not understand about things in this world and did not follow the practice of any prophet, then how could you follow them? It is also said that this means: even though their fathers did not understand anything of Religion and were not guided to the practice of any prophet, how could they follow them?"
