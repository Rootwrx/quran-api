  "text": "Allah then mentioned the punishment of consuming usury, saying: (Those who swallow usury) declaring it to be lawful (cannot rise up) from their graves on the Day of Judgement (save as he ariseth) in the life of this world (whom the Devil hath prostrated) confounded (by (his) touch) of insanity. (That) confusion is, in the Hereafter, the sign of the one who consumes usury (is because they say: Trade is just like usury) increase at the end of selling, once the term is due, is like the increase at the beginning of a transaction when the sale is deferred; (whereas Allah permitteth trading) the former increase (and forbideth usury) the latter increase. (He unto whom and admonition from his Lord cometh) a prohibition of usury comes from his Lord, (and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto)) from dealing in usury, (he shall keep (the profit) that which is past) he shall not be blamed for his dealing in usury before it was made unlawful, (and his affair (henceforth)) in what remains of his life (is with Allah) if He wishes He will protect him and if He wishes He will let him down. (As for him who returneth (to usury)) after usury has been made forbidden and says trade is just like usury (-such are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein) they will abide therein until Allah wills."
