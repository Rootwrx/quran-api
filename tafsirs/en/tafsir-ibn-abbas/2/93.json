  "text": "(And when We made with you a covenant) when we took your consent (and caused the Mount to tower above you) extracted it, elevated it and fixed it above your heads: (Hold fast by that which We have given you) be diligent and earnest with what We have given you of the Book, (and hear) obey what you have been commanded, (they said: We hear and rebel) it is as if they were saying: if it were not for the mountain we would have heard your saying and disobeyed your command. (And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts) their love of worshipping the calf sank into their hearts (because of their rejection) as a punishment for their disbelief. (Say (unto them)) O Muhammad! If love of worshipping the calf is equal in your eyes to love of your Creator, then: (Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you) the worship of the calf enjoins on you, (if ye are believers) if you are truthful that your forefathers were believers."
