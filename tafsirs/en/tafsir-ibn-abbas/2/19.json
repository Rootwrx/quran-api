  "text": "(Or like a rainstorm from the sky). This is another simile, whereby the likeness of the hypocrites and Jews vis-\ufffd-vis the Qur'an is like rain that has poured down from heaven at night onto the wilderness, (wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightening). Such is the Qur'an. For it has come down from Allah; it contains darkness as embodied in the exposition of seditions, thunderings of rebuke whereby fear is instilled, lightening of exposition, instruction and promise. (They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps) due to the sound of the thunder (for fear of death), for fear of misfortune and death. Similarly, the Jews and hypocrites used to put their fingers in their ears when they heard the Qur'an recited, delivering promises and threats like thunder-claps, and this they did for fear of death, i.e. for fear of being drawn to it. (And Allah encompasseth the disbelievers) and hypocrites, i.e. He knows them and will gather them in hell."
