  "text": "(Perform the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah) so that He may accept them, and this by making them sincere unto Him and also by performing the pilgrimage to its final completion and by performing the lesser pilgrimage to the Sacred House. (And if ye are prevented) from performing the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage because of enemies or ill-health, (then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease) then you should offer whatever gifts you can obtain: a sheep, cow or camel in order to leave the Sacred Precinct, (and shave not your heads) if you are prevented (until the gifts) that you have sent (have reached their destination) where it is going to be immolated. (And whoever among you is sick) and cannot remain in the place where he is, then he can return home before his gift reaches its destination (or hath an ailment of the head) or if his head is infested with lice, he should shave it. This verse was revealed about Ka'b Ibn 'Ujrah who shaved his hair when still in a state of ritual consecration because it was infested with lice, (must pay ransom of fasting) the ransom is to fast three days (or almsgiving) to six needy people from the inhabitants of Mecca (or offering) a sheep to be sent to the place of immolation. (And if ye are in safety) from the enemy and you have recovered from your sickness, then you should make up that which Allah has made obligatory upon you in the following year, whether it is a question of the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage, (then whoever contenteth himself with) perfume and clothes after (the visit) the lesser pilgrimage and until he engages in ritual consecration (for the Pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts) then he should offer a sacrifice for making 'Umrah before Hajj (dam al-tamattu') and a sacrifice for doing Hajj and 'Umrah simultaneously (dam al-qaran wa'l-mut'a), whether it is a sheep, cow or camel (as can be had with ease. And whoever cannot find (such gifts)) either a sheep, cow or camel, (then a fast of three days) a fast of three consecutive days (while on the pilgrimage) in the ten days of the pilgrimage, the last of which being the Day of 'Arafah, (and of seven when ye have returned) on your way to your families or after you have returned to your families; (that is, ten in all) in exchange for the gifts."
