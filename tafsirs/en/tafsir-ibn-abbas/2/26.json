  "text": "Then Allah mentioned the Jews' objection to the Qur'an's similes, saying: (Lo! Allah disdaineth not), He cannot abstain from coining similes, and how can He disdain mentioning something that if all created being were to join forces to create, they would not be able to do so. Allah does not disdain (to coin the similitude) Allah does not disdain explaining to people a similitude (even of a gnat), even regarding a gnat, (or what is above it) let alone a simile of something greater than a gnat such as a fly, or a spider. (Those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (know that it), the simile, (is the Truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve), in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such similitude?) say: O Muhammad! What Allah wishes by such simile is that (He misleadeth many thereby) of the Jews from the true Religion, (and He guideth many thereby) of the believers, (and He misleadeth thereby), by such similes, (only miscreants), the Jews."
