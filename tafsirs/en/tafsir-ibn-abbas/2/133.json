  "text": "Then Allah mentioned the dispute among the Jews concerning the religion of Abraham, saying: (Or were ye witnesses) or were you, O assembly of Jews, present (when death came to Jacob) regarding what he enjoined his children, i.e. whether he enjoined them to follow Judaism or Islam, (when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me?) after I die? (They said: We shall worship thy God) we worship, (the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, one God) i.e. we worship one God, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge to worship Him and declare that there is only one true God."
