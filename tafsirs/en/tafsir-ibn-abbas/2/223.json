  "text": "(Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate)) He says: the vulvas of your wives are plantations for your offspring (so go to your tilth) your plantations (as ye will) as you please, from behind or front as long as the penetration is in the pudendum, (and send (good deeds) before you for your souls) righteous children, (and fear Allah) regarding penetrating your wives in their anus or having sex with them during menstruation, (and know that ye will (one day) meet Him) that you will see Him after you die and He will reward you according to your deeds. (Give glad tidings to believers (O Muhammad)) Allah says: give glad tidings, O Muhammad, to the believers, who ward off penetrating their wives in their anus and further abstain from having sex with them when they are menstruating, that Paradise will be theirs."
