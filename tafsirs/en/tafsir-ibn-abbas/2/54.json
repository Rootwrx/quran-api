  "text": "Allah then mentioned the story of Moses with his people, saying: (And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves) harmed yourselves (by your choosing of the calf) by worshipping the calf; and when Moses was then asked what to do, he said to them: (so turn in penitence to your Creator), again they asked him how to turn in penitence to Allah, and he said: (and kill (the guilty) among yourselves) let those who did not worship the calf kill those who worshipped it. (That) penitence and killing (will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent towards you) He will forgive you. (Lo! He is the Relenting) towards the penitent, (the Merciful) towards any that die repentant."
