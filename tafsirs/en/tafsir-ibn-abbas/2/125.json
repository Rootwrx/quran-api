(as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray)) a place whereby you turn in prayer. (And We imposed a duty upon) commanded (Abraham and Ishmael: Purify My house) from idols (for those who go around and those who meditate therein) those who live there (and those who bow down and prostrate themselves) those who perform the five daily prayers, regardless of their country of origin."
