Make this a region of security) free of perturbation (and bestow upon its people fruits) different kinds of fruit, (such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrection after death, (He) Allah (answered: As for him who disbelieveth) as well, (I shall leave him in contentment for a while) I shall provide for him a little in this life, (then I shall compel him) force him (to the doom of fire, a hapless journey's end!) to which he shall come."
