Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth?) the unseen that will take place in the heavens and on the earth. (And I know that which ye disclose), what you show to your Lord in terms of your obedience to Adam (and that which ye hide) of this obedience. It is also said that this refers to what Satan disclosed and kept hidden from them."
