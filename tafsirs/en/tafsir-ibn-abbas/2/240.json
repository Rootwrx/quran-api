  "text": "((In the case of) those who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision) regarding their wealth (for the year) sustenance and habitation for a year (without turning them out) of the houses of their husbands, (but if they go out) of their own accord, or if they marry before the lapse of a year (there is no sin on you) on the inheritors of the deceased to stop providing sustenance and habitation after she leaves the house of her husband or remarries (in that which they do of themselves) nor is there any blame on them in what the wives do to themselves (within their rights) looking forward to remarriage, making themselves beautiful for this purpose. This, i.e. the sustenance due on the deceased towards any wife he leaves behind, was however abrogated by her inheritance. (Allah is Mighty) for He is vengeful towards any that leaves what He has commanded, (Wise) in that He abrogated apportioning a year of sustenance and habitation to the wife whose husband is deceased and substituted it with what is due to her of inheritance: a quarter or eighth of the deceased's wealth."
