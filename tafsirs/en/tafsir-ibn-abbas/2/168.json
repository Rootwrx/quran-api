  "text": "Allah then mentions the lawfulness of cultivating land and raising cattle, saying: (O mankind) O people of Mecca! (Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome) that is not prohibited by Allah (in the earth) of what is cultivated in lands and of cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) the embellishments and whisperings of the devil concerning the unlawfulness of the cultivation of land and of raising cattle. (Lo! He is an open enemy for you) whose enmity towards you is quite manifest."
