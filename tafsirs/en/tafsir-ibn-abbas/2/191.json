(And fight not with them) do not initiate a fight with them (at the Inviolable Place of Worship) in the Sacred Precinct (until they attack you there) until they initiate a fight with you in the Sacred Precinct, (but if they attack you (there)) first (then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers) i.e. death is their reward."
