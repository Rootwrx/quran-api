(Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the deceased if he transgresses or makes a mistake, (Merciful) in relation to the deed of the testator; it is also said that this means: He forgives the testator, and He is also merciful because He gave dispensation to reduce bequests to a third and thus commanded that one adhere to fairness."
