(For he it is who hath revealed to your heart) sent Gabriel to you with the Qur'an (by Allah's leave) by Allah's command, (confirming) affirming the Oneness of Allah (that which was before it) of the Book, (and a guidance) from error (and glad tiding) good news (to believers) that Paradise will be theirs."
