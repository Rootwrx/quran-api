(Do ye know best, or doth Allah?) do you know best about their religion or does Allah? Allah has already informed us that Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. (And who is more unjust) in his disbelief and more insolent and daring vis-\ufffd-vis Allah (than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah) in the Torah concerning the prophethood of this Prophet (pbuh)? (Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what ye do) about concealing your testimony."
