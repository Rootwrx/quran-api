  "text": "(When ye have divorced women) one pronouncement of divorce, (and they have reached their term) their waiting period before they have a major ritual ablution after the third menstruation, (then retain them) take them back as your wives (in kindness) with kind companionship and intercourse (or release them) let them have their major ritual ablution and end the waiting period (in kindness) that will restore their rights. (Retain them not to their hurt) in a way that causes their hurt (so that ye transgress (the limits)) that you transgress against them by prolonging their waiting period for them. (He who doeth that) he who so hurts his wife (hath wronged his own soul) has caused harm to himself. (Make not the revelations of Allah) His commands and prohibitions (a laughing stock (by your behaviour)) by not acting upon them, (but remember Allah's grace upon you) preserve Allah's blessing on you Who gave you Islam (and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture) in the Scripture of commands and prohibitions (and of wisdom) the lawful and the unlawful, (whereby He doth exhort you) prohibits you from hurting them. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah if you hurt them (and know that Allah is Aware of all things) harming others as well as other things."
