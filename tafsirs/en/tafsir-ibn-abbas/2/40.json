O Children of Jacob, (Remember My favour), be thankful and grateful for my blessings (wherewith I favoured you), I favoured you with the Scripture and the emissary, escape from Pharaoh and from drowning as well as sending you honey and quails and other blessings, (and fulfil My covenant) fulfil my covenant regarding this Prophet (pbuh) (I shall fulfil your covenant), by admitting you to Paradise, (and fear Me) as regards the breaking of this covenant and do not fear anyone save Me."
