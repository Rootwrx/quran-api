  "surah": 2,
  "ayah": 266,
  "text": "(Would any of you like) wish (to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it) under its trees, houses and rooms, (with all kinds of fruit for him therein) in the garden; (and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring) who cannot fend for themselves; (and a fiery whirlwind) a strong cold or hot wind (striketh it) i.e. the garden (and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations) His signs through commands and prohibitions (unto you, in order that you may give thought) so that you may reflect on the similes of the Qur'an. This is also like the unbelievers in the Hereafter, they shall have no power neither will they be able to come back to the life of this world just as a person advanced in age is without strength and cannot revert to his former vigour and youth."
