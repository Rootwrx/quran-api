(And now surely We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a Qiblah that is dear to thee) that you like, namely, the Qiblah of Abraham. (So turn thy face) when in prayer (towards the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be) whether on land or in the sea, (turn your faces (when ye pray)) in prayer (towards it. (Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that) the Sacred Precinct (is the Truth from their Lord) is the Qiblah of Abraham but they conceal this fact. (And Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what they do) of what they conceal."
