  "text": "(There is no sin on you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them) while you have not had sex with them, (nor appointed unto them a portion) or have not specified a dowry for them. (Provide for them) as divorce requires, (the rich according to his means, and the strained according to his means, a fair provision) this is in surplus of the price given to the prostitute for her services (mahr al-baghiy), the least amount of it consists of a chemise, a head covering and a wrap. ((This is) a bounden duty for those who do good) it is an obligation upon those who believe in the divine Oneness of Allah because it is a substitute for the dowry."
