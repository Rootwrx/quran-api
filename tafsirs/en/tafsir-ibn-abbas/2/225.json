(But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered) what is hidden in your hearts. (And Allah is Forgiving) of your unintentional oaths, (Clement) in that He does not hasten punishment upon you; it is also said: idle talk is an oath for committing transgression. If one refrains from it and makes amends, then Allah does not take one to task for it; but if one does not refrain from so doing, then Allah will take one to task for it."
