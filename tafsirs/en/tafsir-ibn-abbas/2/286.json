  "text": "By way of response, Allah said: (Allah tasketh not a soul) in relation to acts of obedience (beyond its scope) beyond its capability. (For it (is only) that which it hath earned) of good, and of leaving the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, error and coercion, (and against it (only) that which it hath deserved) of evil, the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, and coercion. Allah taught the believers thereafter how they should pray to Him so as to lift the discourse of the soul, error, forgetfulness and coercion from them, saying that they should supplicate thus: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Condemn us not if we forget) to obey you, (or miss the mark!) regarding your command (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lay not on us such a burden) a covenant which, if we fail to honour, You will prohibit us from wholesome things (as Thou didst) as You made it unlawful (on those before us!) on the Children of Israel because they broke Your covenant regarding wholesome things: the meat of camels, the fat of bovines, small cattle and other things. (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear!) that in which there is no comfort or benefit for us, and this is what is meant by coercion. (Pardon us) all this, (absolve us) from it (and have mercy on us) by means of it. (Thou, our Protector) You are more deserving of protecting us; (and give us victory over the disbelieving folk). It is also said that the meaning is as follows: (Pardon us) by not turning us into animals as you turned some of the people of Jesus into animals, (absolve us) from making the ground swallow us up as you made the ground swallow up Korah (Qarun); (and have mercy on us) by not being tossed up by the waves as you did to the people of Lot. When the believer called upon Allah with this supplication, Allah lifted from them the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, error, coercion and absolved them from being turned into animals, making the ground swallow them or being tossed by the waves. All those who follow in their footsteps will be absolved from the same."
