(Then whoso hasteneth (in departure)) to return to his family (by two days) after the day of immolation, (it is no sin for him) by this hastening, (and whoso delayeth) it to the third day, (it is no sin for him) by this delay; it is said that this means: there is no reproach on him because of this delay and he shall leave with his sins forgiven; (that is for him who wardeth off (evil)) He says: hastening departure is for him who avoids hunting until the third day. (Be careful of your duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah in taking what is hunted until the third day, (and know that unto Him ye will be gathered) after you die"
