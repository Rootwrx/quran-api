((Each) one of them would like) would hope (to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (that long) would by no means remove him) save him (from the doom) if he were to live a thousand years. (And Allah is Seer of what they do) of contraventions, rebellion and what they conceal about the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh)."
