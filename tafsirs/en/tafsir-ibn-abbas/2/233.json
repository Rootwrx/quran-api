  "text": "(Mothers) who are divorced (shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those who wish to complete the suckling) of the child. (The duty of feeding) of suckling the child (and clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner) without excess or stinginess (is upon the father of the child. No soul should be charged) for providing sustenance for suckling (beyond its capacity) except in proportion of what Allah has given it of wealth. (A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child) by taking her child from her after having accepted what was given to someone else for suckling her child, (nor should he whom the child is born) i.e. the father ((be made to suffer) because of his child) by handing him the child after the latter became familiar with his mother and would not take any other breast. (And on the (father's) heir) the heir of the father and it is also said the heir of the child (is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father)) in terms of providing sustenance and avoiding causing harm, in case this person is not the father. (If they) the mother and father (desire to wean the child by mutual consent) of the father and mother (and (after) consultation) between them, (it is no sin for them) i.e. the father and mother, if they do not suckle the child two full years; (and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse) by other than the mother and the latter wants to remarry, (it is no sin for you) for both the mother and father, (provided that ye pay what is due from you) provided that you spend what you have given (in kindness) in consent and without any disagreement. (And observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding harming and disagreement, (and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do)."
