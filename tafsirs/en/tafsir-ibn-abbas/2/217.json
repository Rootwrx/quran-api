  "text": "And so Allah said: (They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month) about waging war in the month of Rajab. (Say: Warfare therein) in the month of Rajab (is a great (transgression)) deserving a great punishment, (but to turn (men) from the way of Allah) but preventing people from the Religion of Allah and His obedience, (and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship) and turning people away from the Inviolable Place of Worship, (and to expel its people from it, is a greater sin) deserving a greater punishment (with Allah) than the killing of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami; (for persecution) associating partners with Allah (is worse than slaughter) the slaughter of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami. (And they), the people of Mecca, (will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion) the religion of Islam, (if they can) if they are able to do so. (And whoso becometh a renegade) whoever renounces Islam (and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen) their works are thwarted and their good deeds rejected (both in the world and the Hereafter) and they will not be rewarded in the Hereafter. (And such are rightful owners of the Fire) the people of hell: (they will abide therein forever) they will neither die nor leave it."
