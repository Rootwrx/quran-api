(Say) O Muhammad! (Lo! The guidance of Allah is Guidance) the Religion of Allah is Islam and Allah's direction of prayer is the Ka'bah. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka'bah, (then wouldst thou have from Allah) from His chastisement (no protecting friend) no one to benefit you (nor helper) to save you from this chastisement."
