We have sent thee) O Muhammad (with the Truth) with the Qur'an and the declaration of the Oneness of Allah, (a bringer of glad tidings) that Paradise shall be for the believers (and a warner) against hell for those who disbelieve in Allah. (And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hellfire) it is not befitting that you should ask about the dwellers of hell; and it is said that this means: do not ask for the forgiveness of the dwellers of hell."
