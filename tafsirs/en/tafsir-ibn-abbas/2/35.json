Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden) enter you and Eve into Paradise (and eat ye freely (of the fruits)) without restriction (thereof where ye will) and whenever you will; (but come not near this tree) but do not eat from this tree, the tree of knowledge, which includes all types and kinds (lest ye become of the wrong-doers), lest you harm yourselves."
