Those who believe) in Allah and His Messenger, (and those who emigrate) from Mecca to Medina (and strive in the way of Allah) by killing the unbeliever 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami, (these have hope in Allah's mercy) they shall obtain Allah's Garden. (And Allah is Forgiving) of what they have done, (Merciful) towards them, since He did not punish them."
