  "text": "(Many of the people of the Scripture) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions and Finhas Ibn 'Azurah and his companions (long to make you disbelievers) make you abandon your Religion and become unbelievers, O 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir], Hudhayfah [Ibn al-Yaman] and Mu'adh Ibn Jabal! (after your belief) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (through envy of their own account) through resentful envy, (after the Truth hath become manifest unto them) in their Book that Muhammad and his Book, his description and traits, are true, (So forgive) leave them (and be indulgent) shun them (until Allah giveth command) brings His chastisement upon Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir, through killing, captivity and expulsion. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) to cause their death and expulsion."
