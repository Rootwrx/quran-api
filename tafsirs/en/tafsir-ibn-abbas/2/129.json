O our Lord (And raise up in their midst) the offspring of Ishmael (a Messenger from among them) from their own lineage (who shall recite unto them Your revelations) the Qur'an, (and shall instruct them in the Scripture) the Qur'an (and in wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited (and shall make them pure) from sins through the declaration of the Oneness of God. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty) Who is vengeful against whosoever does not answer Your Messenger whom You sent to them, (the Wise) in sending the Messenger. And Allah answered his prayers and sent unto them Muhammad (pbuh); and these are the words with which Allah tried him, and he fulfilled them by asking Allah for them in his prayer."
