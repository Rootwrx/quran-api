  "text": "(Their likeness), the likeness of the hypocrites vis-\ufffd-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire), lights a fire in the darkness in order to provide safety for his family, property and person, (and when it sheddeth its light around him), when it sheds its light and he sees what is around him and feels secure, at that very moment the Fire is put out. Likewise, the hypocrites believed openly in Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an and by doing so they felt their persons, families and properties were safe, avoiding in the process imprisonment or death. But when they die (Allah taketh away their light), the benefit of their [outward] faith, (and leaveth them in darkness) facing the hardships of the grave, (where they cannot see) any comfort. It is also said this simile refers to the Jews. In this respect, the likeness of the Jews vis-\ufffd-vis Muhammad (pbuh) is like a man who raises a flag in a lost battle and by doing so attracts other defeated fighters. But when they gather they put their flag down and, consequently, their benefit and safety immediately vanish. Similarly, the Jews used to say that Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, prior to its revelation, would support them. When it was revealed however they denied it and Allah took away their light, i.e. their desire to believe and the benefit of such belief. This is because although they wanted to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) they did not do so, and consequently they were left them in the error of Judaism, unable to see guidance."
