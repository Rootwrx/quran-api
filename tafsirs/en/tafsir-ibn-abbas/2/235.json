  "text": "(There is no sin on you) there is no harm in talking (in that which ye proclaim or hide in your mind concerning your troth with women) concerning your offer to the woman whose husband is dead, before the waiting period ends, that you desire to marry her after the waiting period, such as saying to her: \ufffdIf Allah unites us lawfully, I would like that\ufffd. (Allah knoweth that you will remember them) remember marrying them. (But plight not your troth with them) to have sexual intercourse with them (except by uttering a recognised form of words) properly and unequivocally by saying for example: \ufffdIf Allah unites us lawfully, I would like that\ufffd, and no more. (And do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run) until the waiting period comes to an end. (And know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds) in your hearts whether you are going to honour your pledge or not, (so beware of Him) beware of contravening Him; (and know that Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent of transgressing against Him, (Clement) since He does not hasten His punishment upon those who transgress against Him."
