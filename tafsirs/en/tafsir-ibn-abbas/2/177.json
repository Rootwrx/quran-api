  "text": "(It is not righteousness) it is not all of righteousness; it is also said that (It is not righteousness) means: it is not faith (that ye merely turn your faces) in prayer (to the East) towards Mecca (and the West) towards Jerusalem; (but righteous is) but faith amounts to agreeing with (he who believeth in Allah) and it is also said: the faithful is he who believes in Allah (and the Last Day) in resurrection after death (and the angels) all the angels (and the Scripture) all the revealed Books (and the prophets) and all the prophets; Allah then mentions the obligated duties after mentioning faith, saying: (and giveth his wealth for love of Him) righteousness after declaring one's faith is that one gives of one's wealth, despite the fact that one loves and desires it and has only a little of it, (to kinsfolk) relatives (and to orphans) orphans of the believers (and the needy) who shy away from asking for assistance (and the wayfarer) the passer-by, the guest (and to those who ask) you to give them from your wealth, (and to set slaves free) those who made a contract to pay for their freedom and those who fight in the way of Allah. After mentioning the obligated duties, Allah mentions the different legal prescriptions, saying: (and observeth proper worship) He says: righteousness, after fulfilling the obligated duties, is to perfect the performance of the five daily prayers (and payeth the poor-due) give the poor what is due to them as well as similar things. (And those who keep their treaty) those who fulfil the pledges that are between them and their Lord or between them and other people (when they make one, and the patient in tribulation) i.e. fear, affliction and hardship (and adversity) illness, pain and hunger (and time of stress) upon engagement in fighting. (Such are they who are sincere) who have fulfilled their pledges. (And such are the God fearing) who refrain from breaking their pledges."
