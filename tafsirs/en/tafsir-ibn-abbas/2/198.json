  "text": "(It is no sin) there is no constraint (for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading)) by engaging in trade in the Sacred Precinct. This was revealed about a group of people who were against buying and selling in the Sacred Precinct, and so legal dispensation was given to allow it. (But, when you press on in the multitude from 'Arafat) when you return from 'Arafat to the Sacred monument, (remember Allah) with your heart and tongue (by the Sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before) before Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (ye were of the astray) among the unbelievers."
