  "text": "(And when ye have completed your devotions) upon finishing the rites of your pilgrimage, (then remember Allah) say: O Allah! (as ye remember your fathers) as you say: father! It is also said that this means: remember Allah for the blessings He showered on you as you used to remember the kindness of your fathers in the pre-Islamic era (or with a more lively remembrance) remember Him more than you used to remember your fathers. (But of mankind is he who saith) on the standing site: (\ufffdOur Lord! Give unto us in the world,) camels, cows, sheep, male and female slaves and wealth\ufffd (and he hath no portion in the Hereafter) of Paradise by performing the pilgrimage."
