  "text": "(They question thee about strong drink and games of chance). This was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who prayed: \ufffdO Allah! Show us Your judgement regarding alcoholic drinks!\ufffd So Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) O Muhammad! (in both is great sin) this is after they were declared unlawful, (and (some) utility for men) by means of their trading, i.e. before they were unlawful; (but the sin of them) after their being declared unlawful (is greater than their usefulness) before they were made unlawful; and then both were prohibited. (And they ask thee what they ought to spend). This was revealed about 'Amr Ibn al-Jamuh who asked the Prophet (pbuh): \ufffdWhat should we spend from our wealth\ufffd. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about what they should spend from their wealth. (Say: That which is superfluous) that which is in surplus to your sustenance requirements and of food for your dependents. But this was abrogated by those verses on the poor-due. (Thus Allah maketh plain to you (the) revelations) the commands and prohibitions and the insignificance of this world, (that ye may reflect) that it is evanescent."
