  "text": "Then Allah mentioned the spending of the believers in the way of Allah, saying: (The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way) He says: the likeness of the wealth of those who spend in His way (is as the likeness of a grain which groweths seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains) likewise, Allah multiplies what the believers spend in His way from one to seven hundred fold. (Allah giveth increase manifold) in surplus of this (to whom He will) to whomever deserves it; it is also said: to whomever Allah accepts his spending. (Allah is All-Embracing) by multiplying his reward manifold, (All-Knowing) of what the believers spend and of their intentions."
