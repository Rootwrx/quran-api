  "text": "((Fast) a certain number of days) 30 days; (and (for) him who is sick among you, or on a journey, (the same) number of other days) let him fast the same number of days he missed; (and for those who can afford it) afford to fast (there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need-) let him feed a person in need, instead of every day of the fast that he missed, half a measure of wheat. But this is abrogated by Allah's saying: (And whoever of you is present, let him fast the month). It is also said that this means: those who can afford a ransom and are not able to fast, old men and women who are unable to fast, they should feed a needy person, for every missed day of fast in Ramadan, half a measure of wheat. (But whoso doeth good of his own accord) gives more than two pounds, (it is better for him) in terms of reward: (and that ye fast is better for you) than giving ransom (if ye did but know-)"
