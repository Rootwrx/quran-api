  "text": "(When his Lord said unto him) when he came out of the pit of fire: (Surrender) say specifically: there is no god save Allah! (He said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds) I submit to the Lord of all the worlds, and declare that Allah is the only One God, without partner. It is also said that when Abraham invited his people to accept that Allah is One without partners, his Lord said unto him: make your Religion and works sincere to Allah; and he answered: I make my Religion and works sincere to the Lord of the worlds. And it is also said that when Abraham was thrown in the Fire, his Lord said unto him: make your religion and works sincere to Allah; he replied: I comply and make my Religion and works sincere to Allah, Lord of all the worlds."
