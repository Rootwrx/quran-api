  "text": "Allah thereafter mentions the saying of the hypocrites apropos the martyrs of Badr, Uhud and all the other battles: \" So-and-so has died and lost all comfort and happiness \" , this in order to aggravate sincere believers, and so Allah says: (And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, on the Day of Badr or in any other battle ( \" dead \" ) like any other dead people. (Nay they are living) they are rather living like those living in Paradise, being provided with comfort and bounties, (only ye perceive not) you are not aware of the honour bestowed upon them or of their real state."
