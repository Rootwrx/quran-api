  "ayah": 265,
  "text": "(And the likeness of those who spend their wealth) the likeness of the wealth of those who spend it (in search of Allah's pleasure) seeking Allah's pleasure, (and for the strengthening of their souls) truly, out of conviction and certitude in their hearts that they will be rewarded, (is as the likeness of a garden on a height) on an elevated plain. (The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower) this is like the spending of the believer, whether small or great, when it is done with sincerity and fearingness, Allah multiplies it as He multiplies the fruits of a garden. (Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you spend."
