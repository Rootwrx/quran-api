(Those who do wrong) those who satirized the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!) what kind of destination they will return to in the Hereafter, i.e. the Fire, if they do not believe. And Allah knows best the secrets of His Book'."
