  "text": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (When the hypocrites come unto thee): '(When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad)) when the hypocrites of Medina, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and Jadd Ibn Qays-who were cousins-come to you, (they say: We bear witness) we swear by Allah (that thou art) O Muhammad (indeed Allah's messenger) we know this and are conscious of it. (And Allah knoweth) and Allah bears witness (that thou art) O Muhammad (indeed His messenger) without the need for the testimony of the hypocrites, (and Allah beareth witness) and Allah knows (that the Hypocrites are speaking falsely) that the hypocrites lie in their oath, because they do not know it nor are their hearts conscious of it."
