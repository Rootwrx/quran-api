  "text": "(He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days) of the days of the beginning of the life of the world whereby one day is 1,000 years of the days we know, the first day being Sunday and the last Friday; (then He mounted the Throne) He established Himself on the Throne and it is said He filled it. Before He created the heavens and the earth, Allah was established on the Throne without any modality (bila-kayf). (He knoweth all that entereth the earth) of rain, treasures and dead created beings, (and all that emergeth therefrom) from the earth of dead created beings, vegetation, water and treasures (and all that cometh down from the sky) of provision, rain, angels and misfortunes (and all that ascendeth therein) of angels, the angels who record people's actions and works; (and He is with you) and He is Aware of you (wheresoever ye may be) on land or at sea. (And Allah is Seer of what ye do) of good or evil."
