  "text": "(And those who believe in Allah and His messengers) from among all nations, (they are the loyal) in their faith; (and the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light) at the Bridge over hell; and it is also said this means that the martyrs mentioned above refer to the witnesses who will testify in favour of the prophets against their respective peoples; and it is said that they refer to those who were killed while fighting for the sake of Allah: all these have the reward of the prophets in the course of conveying their message and will also have their light at the Bridge over hell to see their way while crossing it; (while as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations) i.e. the Scripture and Messenger, (they are owners of hellfire) they are the dwellers of the Fire."
