  "text": "(Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth) such as drought, dryness of land, rise in prices and continuous hunger (or in yourselves) such as sicknesses, pains, misfortunes, the death of one's family members and children and loss of wealth (but it is in a Book) He says: all this is decreed upon you and recorded in the Guarded Tablet (before We bring it into being) before they befall the earth or your own selves. (Lo! That) the recording of that (is easy for Allah) even without a record, but everything is recorded."
