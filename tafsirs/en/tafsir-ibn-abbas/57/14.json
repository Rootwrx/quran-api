(They will say: Yea, verily; but ye tempted one another) you ruined yourselves through your secret disbelief and hypocrisy, (and hesitated) and you shunned repenting from disbelief and hypocrisy; and it is said that this means: you waited for the death of Muhammad (pbuh) so that you would then reveal your disbelief, (and doubted) in Allah, His Scripture and His Messenger, (and vain desires) falsehoods and false hope (beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass) until the promise of Allah was fulfilled that you die without repentance from disbelief and hypocrisy; (and the deceiver) i.e. Satan; and it is said that this means: the falsehoods of the life of the world (deceived you concerning Allah) concerning the obedience of Allah;"
