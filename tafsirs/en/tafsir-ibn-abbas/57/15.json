(Your home is the Fire) your destination is the Fire; (that is your patron) it has better right over you, (and a hapless journey's end) they will come to: their companions being the satans, their neighbours the disbelievers, their food the Zaqqum, their drink boiling water, their clothes pieces of fire and their visitors snakes and scorpions."
