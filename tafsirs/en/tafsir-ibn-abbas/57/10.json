(Those) of you, O believers (who spent and fought) the enemy along with the Prophet (pbuh) (before the victory) before the conquest of Mecca (are not upon a level (with the rest of you)) are not equal in the sight of Allah in terms of merit and obedience. (Such) the people who have this trait (are greater in rank) in merit and standing in the sight of Allah through their obedience and reward-this refers to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq-(than those who spent and fought afterwards) than those who spend after the conquest of Mecca and fight the enemies along with the Prophet (pbuh) thereafter. (Unto each hath Allah promised good) i.e. the Garden through faith. (And Allah is Informed of what ye do) of what you spend."
