  "text": "(On the day) i.e. the Day of Judgement (when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say) while on the Bridge over hell (unto those who believe) the true believers: (Look on us) and wait for us, O group of believers, (that we may borrow from your light) that we use your light to see and cross the Bridge over hell! (it will be said) the believers will say to them; and it is said: the angels will say to them; and it is said Allah will say to them: (Go back) to the life of the world; and it is said this means: go back to the stopping-place where we were given light (and seek for light!) This is said to the hypocrites out of mockery by Allah; and it is also said that this is said by the believers; and so the hypocrites will go back seeking light. (Then there will separate them) i.e. the believers and the hypocrites (a wall wherein is a gate, the inner side whereof containeth mercy) Paradise, (while the outer side thereof is towards the doom) towards hell."
