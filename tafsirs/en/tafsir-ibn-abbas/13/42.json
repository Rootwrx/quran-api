(He) Allah (knows that which each soul) whether believing or unbelieving (earneth) of good or evil. (The disbelievers) the Jews and all the disbelievers (will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home) i.e. Paradise; it is also said that this means: the disbelievers will come to know for whom is the upper hand on the Day of Badr and to whom Mecca will belong."
