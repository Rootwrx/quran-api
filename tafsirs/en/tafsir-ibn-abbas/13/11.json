(Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk) the blessing and safety of a people (until they (first) change that which is in their hearts) by failing to give thanks; (and if Allah willeth misfortune) a chastisement or destruction (for a folk there is none that can repel it) there is none that can repel Allah's decree concerning them, (nor have they) for those whom Allah wants to destroy (a defender) who can save them from Allah's chastisement; it is also said that this means: none can give them a refuge to which they can escape (beside Him) beside Allah."
