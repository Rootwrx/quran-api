(Such) those who deny the Resurrection (are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such) the disbelieving folk (have carcans on their necks) they have chains on their hands tied up to their necks; (such) those who are chained (are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell, (they will abide therein) they will dwell therein, never to die or come out of it."
