  "text": "(Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will) Ibn 'Abbas said: \" there are among His servants people who are only suited for an enlarged livelihood, such that a straitened livelihood would harm them; and there are among His servants people who are only suited for a straitened livelihood, such as an enlarged livelihood would harm them \" , i.e. Allah gives abundant wealth in the life of this world to whomever He wills as a devise from Him, (and straiteneth (it for whom He will)) He withholds abundant wealth from whomever He wills out of care from Him; (and they rejoice in the life of the world) they are pleased with that which is in the life of this world of comfort and merriment, (whereas the life of the world) what is in the life of this world of comfort and merriment (is but brief comfort) very little; it is compared to the worth of household stuffs such as a platter, bowl, saucepan, and similar things (as compared with the Hereafter) as compared with the lasting bliss of the Hereafter."
