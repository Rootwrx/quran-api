  "text": "(Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul) He says: Allah oversees every soul and that which it earns of good and evil, provision and warding off; is He therefore ((as he who is aware of nothing)? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners) idols which they worship. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Name them) enumerate their benefit and governance if they are Allah's partners. (Is it that ye would inform Him) are you going to inform Him (of something which He knoweth not) to exist (in the earth) which benefits or harms beside Allah? (Or is it but a way of speaking) or is it just out of false talk, false testimony and lying that they do worship them? (Nay, but their contrivance) their speech and deeds (is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and they are kept from the right road) they were sent astray from Religion. (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no guide) no one to give him success."
