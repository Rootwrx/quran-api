  "text": "(Allah it is who raised up the heavens) He created the heavens and raised them up above the earth (without visible supports) He says: you see them without support; it is also said that this means: they have supports which you do not see, (then mounted the Throne) Allah was on the Throne before He raised up the heavens; it is also said that this means: He established Himself on the Throne; and it is also said that this means: as far as His knowledge and power are concerned, that which is near and that which is far are all equal to Him, (and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service) He made the light emanating from the sun and the moon of service to the Children of Adam, (each runneth unto an appointed term) to a fixed time; (He ordereth the course) He looks into the affairs of the servants and He sends the angels with revelation, Scripture and misfortune; (He detaileth the revelations) He explains the Qur'an by expositing the commands and prohibitions, (that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord) that you may believe in resurrection after death."
