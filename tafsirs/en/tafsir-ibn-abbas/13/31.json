  "text": "Then the following was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his companions who said to the Prophet: make the mountains disappear by means of your Qur'an; or make springs gush out of them, just as David did with the fount of copper, as you claim; or bring for us a wind by means of which we travel to Historic Syria and return, just as it was done by Solomon, according to you; or bring our dead to life as did Jesus, as you claim. So Allah said: (Had it been possible for a Lecture) other than the Qur'an which has been revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) (to cause the mountains to move) by means of which mountains are made to disappear from the face of the earth, (or the earth to be torn asunder) by means of which to travel long distances, (or the dead to speak) or by means of which the dead are brought back to life, the Qur'an which was revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) would have done so. (Nay, but Allah's is the whole command) rather, Allah can do all these things, if He wills. (Do not those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (know that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind)?) if he willed, He would have honoured all mankind with His religion (As for those who disbelieve) in the Scriptures and messengers, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca, (disaster) a military detachment; and it is said this means: a thunderbolt (ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do) in their state of disbelief, (or it dwelleth near) or make camp with your Companions near (their home) near their city Mecca, in 'Usfan (until the threat of Allah) the Conquest of Mecca (come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) i.e. the Conquest of Mecca; as it is said this means: resurrection after death."
