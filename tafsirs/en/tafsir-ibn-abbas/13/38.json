  "text": "(And verily We sent messengers (to mankind) before thee) just as We have sent you, (and We appointed for them wives) more than you have of wives, such as David and Solomon (and offspring) more than your offspring, such was the case with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This verse was revealed about the Jews because they said: Had Muhammad been a prophet, he would have been too preoccupied to get married, (and it was not (given) to any messenger that he should bring a portent) a sign (save by Allah's leave) save by Allah's command. (For everything there is a time prescribed) an appointed time."
