(And of the clans) i.e. the Jews (there are who deny some of it) some of the Qur'an, except the surah of Joseph and the portions of it in which the All-Merciful is mentioned; it is also said that the clans her refers to the Confederates, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca as well as other disbelievers, who deny some of the Qur'an in which the All-Merciful is mentioned. (Say) O Muhammad: (I am commanded only that I serve Allah) in all sincerity (and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry) I call people unto Him, (and unto Him is my return) my return in the Hereafter."
