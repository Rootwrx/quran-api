  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Who is Lord) who is the Creator (of the heaven and the earth?) if they answer and say Allah, then fine; if not, (Say: Allah) is their Creator! (Say) O Muhammad: (Take ye) worship you (then (others) beside Him) beside Allah (for protectors) lords from among idols, (which, even for themselves, have neither benefit) neither procuring benefit (nor hurt) nor driving away harm? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Is the blind man equal to the seer) is the unbeliever equal to the believer, (or is darkness equal to light) i.e. disbelief and faith? (Or assign they) describe (unto Allah partners) from among idols (who created) creation (the like of His creation so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them) such that they do not distinguish Allah's creation from the creation of their idols? (Say) O Muhammad: (Allah is the Creator of all things) while their idols have created nothing, (and He is the One, the Almighty) He is All-Conquering above His created beings."
