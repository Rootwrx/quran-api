Would it not be better for you, O Hatib, to say as Abraham and the believers with him said. (And whosoever may turn away) from what he was commanded by Allah, (lo! still Allah, He is the Absolute) Allah is free of need for him as He is free of need for His creation, (the Owner of Praise) Who is praiseworthy in His acts; and it is said this means: the Owner of Praise regarding the one who professes His divine Oneness; and it is also said that the Owner of Praise means: He is thankful for little but He rewards for it abundantly."
