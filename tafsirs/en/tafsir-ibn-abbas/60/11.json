  "text": "(And if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers) with whom you do not have any treaty or pledge (and afterward ye have your turn (of triumph)) and afterward you obtain booty from the enemy, (then give unto those whose wives have gone) to the disbelievers (the like of that which they have spent) of dowry on their wives; this should be given before the fifth of the booty is taken out from it, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding that which He commands you (in whom ye are believers) true believers. There were just six women who left Islam and joined the disbelievers of Mecca, two of them were wives of 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, Umm Salamah and Umm Kulthum Bint Jarul, and also Umm al-Hakam the daughter of Abu Sufyan who was the wife of 'Abbad Ibn Shaddad al-Fihri, and Fatimah Bint Abi Umayyah Ibn al-Mughirah and Buru' Bint 'Uqbah who was the wife of Shammas Ibn 'Uthman from the Banu Makhzum, and 'Abdah Bint 'Abd al-'Uzza Ibn Nadlah whose husband was 'Amr Ibn Wudd, and Hind Bint Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham whose husband was Hashim Ibn al-'Ass Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi. The Prophet (pbuh) gave back to the husbands of these women the dowry they had spend on them."
