Meaning Muhammad (If believing women) the woman of the people of Mecca (come unto thee) after the conquest of Mecca, (taking oath of allegiance unto thee that they will ascribe nothing as partner unto Allah) among idols nor deem this to be lawful, (and will neither steal) or deem stealing permitted (nor commit adultery) or deem it lawful (nor kill their children) nor bury their daughters alive or deem this to be lawful, (nor produce any lie) nor bring any child conceived from fornication (that they have devised between their hands and feet) and then tell their husbands it is theirs, (nor disobey you in what is right) nor disobey you in all that which you command and forbid them such as shunning wailing, pulling out their hair, tearing apart their clothes, scratching their faces, rending their outer garments, shaving their heads, being alone with strangers or travelling alone a journey of three days or less without the company of an unmarriageable person, (then accept their allegiance) on this (and ask Allah to forgive them) that which they committed in the pre-Islamic era. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) after the conquest of Mecca, He forgives them what they committed in the pre-Islamic period, (Merciful) in relation to what they do after they have accepted Islam."
