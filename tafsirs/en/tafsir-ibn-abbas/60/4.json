  "text": "(There is a goodly pattern) a good example (for you) O Hatib (Abraham) in Abraham's words (and those with him) and also in the words of the believers who were with him, (when they told their folk) when they told their disbelieving kinsfolk; (Lo! we are guiltless of you) of your kinship and religion (and all that ye worship beside Allah) of idols. (We have done with you) we absolve ourselves from you and from your religion. (And there hath arisen between us and you hostility) through killing and beating (and hate) in the hearts (for ever until ye believe in Allah only) until you declare Allah's divine Oneness (save that which Abraham promised) save the words of Abraham to (his father (when he said): I will ask forgiveness for thee) because he promised him to do so, but when his father died in a state of disbelief, Abraham disavowed him, saying: (though I own nothing for thee from Allah) from Allah's chastisement. Allah then taught them what to say: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (In Thee we put our trust) we rely on you, (and unto Thee we turn repentant) we turn to your obedience, (and unto Thee is the journeying) and unto You is the return in the Hereafter."
