(Make us not a prey for those who disbelieve) for the disbelievers of Mecca; they said: do not set them on us, lest they think they are following the Truth while we are following falsehood, which will only embolden them against us, (and forgive us) our sins, (our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty) in retribution against whoever does not believe in You, (the Wise) in helping those who believe in You."
