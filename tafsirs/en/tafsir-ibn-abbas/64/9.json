  "text": "(The day) which is the day of Judgement (when He shall gather you unto the Day of Assembling) when the earlier and later generations will be assembled, (that will be a day of mutual disillusion) the disbeliever will be duped regarding his own person, family, servants and properties in Paradise and the believer will inherit him; it is also said that this means: the believer will dupe the disbeliever regarding his family and properties, and the disbeliever will be duped about his own person in the Garden and the believer will inherit him, and the wronged will dupe the one who wronged him by taking his good deeds and giving him his own evil deeds. (And whoso believeth in Allah) and in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and does right) sincerely between himself and his Lord, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins because of his belief in Allah's divine Oneness (and will bring him into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) dwelling in Paradise never to die or leave it. (That is the Supreme Triumph) that is the supreme gain: they gained the Garden and are saved from the Fire."
