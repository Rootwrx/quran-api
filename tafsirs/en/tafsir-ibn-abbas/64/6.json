  "text": "(That) torment (was because their messengers (from Allah) kept coming unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) detailing commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they said: Shall mere mortals) human beings like us (guide us) call us to believe in Allah's divine Oneness? (So they disbelieved) in the Scriptures, messengers and signs (and turned away) from accepting faith in the Scriptures, messengers and signs, (and Allah was independent (of them)) of their faith. (Allah is Absolute) Allah is free of need for their faith, (Owner of Praise) He is praiseworthy in His acts; it is also said that this means: He is the Owner of Praise as far as those who believe in His divine Oneness are concerned."
