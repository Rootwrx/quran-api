Among your wives and your children) who are in Mecca (there are enemies for you) in that they barred you from migration and jihad, (therefore beware of them) lest you fail to migrate or engage in jihad. (And if ye efface) if you pardon them for barring you (and overlook) and turn away from them, and not punish them (and forgive) their sins after they have migrated from Mecca to Medina, (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives he who repents, (Merciful) towards he who die repentant."
