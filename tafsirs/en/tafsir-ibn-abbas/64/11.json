(And whosoever believeth in Allah) seeing that the calamity is from Allah, (He guideth his heart) to have contentment and patience; it is also said: when Allah gives him, he is thankful and when Allah tries him, he is patient and when he wrongs someone, he asks for forgiveness, and when a calamity befalls him, he says: \ufffdverily we are unto Allah, and unto Him we shall return\ufffd. (And Allah is Knower of all things) that befall you, whether it is a calamity or something else."
