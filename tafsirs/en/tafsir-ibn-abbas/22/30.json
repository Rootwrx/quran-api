  "text": "(That (is the command)) that which I have mentioned of rites, they have to fulfil it. (And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah) i.e. the rites of the pilgrimage, (it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord) in terms of reward. (The cattle) the immolated cattle and the eating of their meat (are lawful unto you save that which has been told you) in Surah al-Ma'idah such as carrion, blood and pork. (So shun the filth of idols) so leave the drinking of intoxicants and the worship of idols, (and shun lying speech) and abstain from uttering falsehood and lies. This is because they used to say during their pilgrimage in the pre-Islamic time: \" here we are, O Lord, here we are, you have no partners except for a partner that you possess and it possesses not \" , and so Allah forbade them from saying this."
