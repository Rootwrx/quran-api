And We inspired him (saying: Ascribe thou no thing) no idols (as partner unto Me, and purify My House) purify My Mosque from idols (for those who make the round (thereof) and those who stand) and those who live there (and those who bow and make prostration) the people who pray from all countries and from wherever they happen to come."
