  "text": "(O mankind!) i.e. O people of Mecca (if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection) after death, then reflect upon your initial creation, for bringing you back to life is not more difficult than your initial creation, (then lo! We have created you from dust) We have created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then) We created you after that (from a drop of seed, then from a clot) of blood after the drop of semen, (then from a little lump of flesh) after the clot of blood (shapely) in a perfect shape (and shapeless) when miscarriage takes place, (that We may make (it) clean for you) in the Qur'an after you are created. (And We cause what We will) of unborn children (to remain in the wombs) preventing it from miscarriage; and it is also said that this means: We leave it in the wombs (for an appointed time) for a certain number of months, (and afterward We bring you forth) from the wombs (as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength) from the age of 18 to the age of 30 years old. (And among you there is he who dieth (young)) before the age of puberty, (and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life) is brought back to his initial state after he reaches abject age, (so that, after knowledge) after his first initial knowledge, (he knoweth naught) such that he becomes undiscerning. (And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren) dead and cracked, (but when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill) with vegetation; it is also said that this means: it vibrates and cheers up (and swell) for the vegetation (and put forth) by means of water (ever lovely kind (of growth)) of every comely kind of plants."
