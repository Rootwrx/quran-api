  "text": "(That (is so)) that is Allah's judgement between the believers and disbelievers in the Hereafter. (And whoso hath retaliated) against the killer of his relative (with the like of that which he) his relative (was made to suffer and then hath (again) been wronged) and then he transgresses again against him, (Allah will succour him) i.e. Allah will help the wronged person against the transgressor, such that he kills him and no blood money will be taken from him. This is the case of a man whose relative is killed. And so he takes blood money from the killer of his relative. But then this man proceeds to kill the killer of his relative. This man must be killed and no blood money is accepted from him. (Lo! Allah verily is Mild) He pardons whoever repents, (Forgiving) He forgives whoever dies repentant."
