  "text": "(Whoso is wont to think that Allah will not give him) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (victory in the world and the Hereafter) through reason and proof, (let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang himself. Then let him see) let him reflect upon (whether his strategy) hanging himself (dispelleth that whereat he rageth!) i.e. regarding Muhammad (pbuh). It is also said that there is another way of understanding this passage: whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this worldly life with sustenance and in the Hereafter with reward, then let him tie a rope to the roof of his house, hang himself with it and see whether killing himself will dispel his rage regarding sustenance."
