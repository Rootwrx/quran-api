  "text": "(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens) of created beings (and whosoever is in the earth) of the believers, (and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts) all of these prostrate to Allah, (and many of mankind) Paradise has been enjoined for them, these are the believers, (while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due) while the chastisement of the Fire has been enjoined upon many, these are the disbelievers. (He whom Allah scorneth) he whom Allah abases through damnation, (there is none to give him honour) through felicity; it is also said that this means: he whom Allah abases by means of ignorance, there is none to give him honour through knowledge. (Lo! Allah doeth what He will) with His created beings; He gives felicity and damnation, knowledge and ignorance."
