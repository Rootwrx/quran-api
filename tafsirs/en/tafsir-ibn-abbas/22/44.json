(And Moses was denied) the Copts denied him; (but I indulged the disbelievers a long while) but I gave a reprieve to the disbelievers in their state of disbelief until the appointed time, (then I seized them) with chastisement, (and how (terrible) was My abhorrence!) see, O Muhammad, how I changed towards them through My punishment."
