  "text": "(And the camels!) and bovines (We have appointed them) We have made them subservient to you (among the ceremonies of Allah) among the rites of the pilgrimage so that you immolate them. (Therein) in these sacrifices (ye have much good) you have much reward. (So mention the name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines) when you immolate them, and let them be free of defects; it is also said that this means: they should have their left foot tied up such that they stand on three. (Then when their flanks fall (dead)) after immolating them, (eat thereof) of the meat of these sacrifices (and feed the beggar) who is content with little (and the supplicant) the one who faces you but does not beg of you. (Thus have We made them subject unto you, that haply ye may give thanks) that you may give thanks to His bounty and dispensation."
