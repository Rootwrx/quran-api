Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that) worse than what you told the Muslims in the life of this world? They said to them: \" We have seen no adherents of any religion who are less fortunate than you \". And so Allah said: Say, O Muhammad\ufffd Allah said: what is worse is (The Fire! Allah hath promised it for the ones who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an; and you are indeed disbelievers in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (A hapless journey's end) to which they will come!"
