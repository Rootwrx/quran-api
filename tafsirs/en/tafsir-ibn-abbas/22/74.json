  "text": "(They measure not Allah His rightful measure) they do not magnify Allah as He deserves to be magnified. This was revealed about the Jews when they claimed that 'Uzayr was the son of God, and due to their sayings: \ufffdAllah is poor while we are rich,\ufffd, \ufffdAllah's hands are tight because of miserliness\ufffd and that Allah rested after He finished creating the heavens and the earth. (Lo! Allah is Strong) against His enemies, (Almighty) He is Mighty in His vengeance against the Jews."
