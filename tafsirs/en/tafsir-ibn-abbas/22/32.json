(And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah) and whoever magnifies the rites of pilgrimage, and thus immolates the fattest and biggest beast of cattle, (it) the immolation of the fattest and biggest beast of cattle (surely is from devotion of the hearts) is due to the limpidity of the person's heart and his sincerity."
