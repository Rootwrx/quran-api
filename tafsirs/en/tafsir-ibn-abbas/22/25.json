It is also said that this was revealed concerning 'Abdullah Ibn Anas Ibn Hanzal who intentionally killed a Helper in Medina, left the religion of Islam and fled to Mecca. And so was revealed the passage: (whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein) towards anyone, (him We shall cause to taste a painful doom) such that he is not given food, drink or shelter until he leaves the Sacred Precinct and the legal punishment is applied on him."
