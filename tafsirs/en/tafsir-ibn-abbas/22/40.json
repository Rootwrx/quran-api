  "text": "(Those who have been driven from their homes) the disbelievers of Mecca drove them from their homes (unjustly) without any right or crime (only because they said: Our Lord is Allah) only because they said: there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. (For had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means of others) and so He checks by means of the prophets the believers. And through the believers He checks the disbelievers, and through the fighters He checks those who do not take part in fighting; if it had not been for this (cloisters) the cloisters of monks (and churches) of the Jews (and oratories) the Magians' houses of fire, because these were safe from Muslims (and mosques) of the Muslims, (wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned) repeating the formulas: \ufffdAllah is the greatest\ufffd and \ufffdthere is no deity except Allah\ufffd, (would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth one) against his enemies (who helpeth Him) who helps His Prophet in jihad. (Lo! Allah is Strong) to help His Prophet and whoever helps His Prophet, (Almighty) He is Mighty in His vengeance against the enemies of His Prophet."
