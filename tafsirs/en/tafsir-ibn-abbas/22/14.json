Allah causeth those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) acts of obedience between them and their Lord (to enter the Gardens beneath) beneath their trees and habitations (which rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth) whether it is bestowing bliss or inflicting damnation. This was also revealed about them when they said: we are afraid that Muhammad does not triumph in this world and, thus, we would loose the affinity existing between us and the Jews."
