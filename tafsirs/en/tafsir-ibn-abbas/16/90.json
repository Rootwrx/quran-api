Allah enjoineth justice) Allah's divine Oneness (and kindness) through fulfilling the obligations; it is also said that this means: kindness to people, (and giving to kinsfolk) i.e. keeping ties with one's kinsfolk, (and forbideth lewdness) all transgressions (and abomination) that which is not known in the Shari'ah or Sunnah (and wickedness) overbearing and oppression. (He exhorteth you) He forbids you from engaging in lewdness, abomination and wickedness (in order that ye may take heed) in order that you take admonition from the parable of the Qur'an."
