(And We reveal the Scripture unto thee) and We send Gabriel to you with the Qur'an (as an exposition of all things) of the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions, (and a guidance) from error (and a mercy) preventing from chastisement (and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah)) that they will have Paradise."
