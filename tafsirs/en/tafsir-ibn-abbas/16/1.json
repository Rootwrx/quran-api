  "text": "And from his chain of transmitters on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said: 'When the words of Allah (The reckoning draws near for mankind\ufffd) [21:1] and (The hour drew near\ufffd) [54:1], people waited whatever time Allah willed them to wait, but nothing happened. So they said: \ufffdO Muhammad! When will the torment which you promised us happen?\ufffd As a response, Allah revealed: (The commandment of Allah will come to pass) the chastisement of Allah has come. The Prophet (pbuh) was sitting at that point and he suddenly stood, having no doubt in his mind that the chastisement had come. But immediately after that, Allah said: (so seek not ye to hasten it) i.e. the chastisement, at which the Prophet (pbuh) sat down. (Glorified) Allah exonerated Himself from having a son or partner (and Exalted be He) He is too elevated and absolves Himself (above all that they associate (with Him)) of idols."
