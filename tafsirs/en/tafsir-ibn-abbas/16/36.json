(Then some of them) We sent messengers ((there were) whom Allah guided) to His religion, and so they accepted faith from the messengers, (and some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold) it was decreed that they would not accept faith from the messengers. (Do but travel in the land and sea) reflect upon (the nature of the consequence for the deniers!) the end result of those who denied the messengers."
