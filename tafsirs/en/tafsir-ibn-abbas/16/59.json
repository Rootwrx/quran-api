  "text": "(He hideth himself from the folk) he stays away from his folk (because of the evil) because of the dislike (of that whereof he hath bad tidings) because of the baby girl who was born to him, and hates to divulge it, ((asking himself): Shall he keep it) alive (in contempt) despite humiliation and hardship, (or bury it beneath the dust) alive. (Verily evil is their judgement) evil is their choice: they prefer sons for themselves and ascribe daughters to Allah."
