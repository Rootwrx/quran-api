(these are our partners) our gods (unto whom we used to cry instead of Thee) they commanded us to worship them. (But they will fling to them the saying) i.e. the idols will answer them and say: (Lo! ye verily are liars!) in what you say: we never commanded you to worship us nor were we aware of your worship."
