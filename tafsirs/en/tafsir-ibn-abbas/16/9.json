  "text": "(And Allah's is the direction of the way) He is the guide whether it is in the sea or on the land, (and some (roads) go not straight) they are crooked and one cannot find one's way through them. (And had He willed He would have led you all aright) in your way whether you are in the sea or on the land; it is also said that (And Allah's is the direction of the way) means: it is Allah Who guides to monotheism, and some of the religions are crooked and unjust such as Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism. And if Allah had willed, He would have guided you all to His religion."
