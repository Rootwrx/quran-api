(Then will they make full submission (saying)) they will answer; it is also said that this means: they resign to Allah, saying: (We used not to do any wrong) we did not worship anything beside Allah nor did we associate partners with Him. (Nay!) Allah will say: nay! (Surely Allah is Knower of what ye used to do) and say and worship beside Allah."
