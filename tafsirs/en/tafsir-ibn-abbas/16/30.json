(They say Good) the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and keeping ties of kinship: (For those who do good) for those who profess monotheism (in this world there is a good (reward)) Paradise on the Day of Judgement (and the home of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (will be better) than this worldly life and all there is in it. (Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry, and indecencies."
