  "text": "(Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted). This verse was revealed about the tribes of Kindah and Murad; it is also said that this means: honour your pledges when you swear by Allah, (and break not your oaths) i.e. the pledges that you pledge between yourselves (after the asseveration of them) after ascertaining and confirming them, (and after ye have made Allah surety over you) i.e. a Witness over you; it is also said that this means: a Guardian over you. Meaning: both parties made their pledge and said: Allah is witness that we will honour our pledge. (Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do) whether you break or honour your pledges."
