  "text": "Allah then gave a parable regarding the believer and the disbeliever, saying: (Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave) Allah explained the traits of this slave, (who hath control of nothing) he has no power to spend or do any good, and in this respect he is just like the disbeliever from whom no good ever comes, (and (on the other hand) one on whom We have bestowed a fair provision) abundant wealth (from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly) between him and his Lord (and openly) between him and other people for the sake of Allah; this is the simile of the sincere believer. (Are they equal) in their reward and obedience? (Praise be to Allah!) gratitude is due to Allah and divine Oneness is also Allah's. (But most of them know not) the parable of the Qur'an. It is also said that this verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and an Arab man called Abu'l-'Is Ibn Umayyah."
