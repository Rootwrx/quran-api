  "text": "(And We have commended unto man) We have commanded 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn Abi Bakr in the Qur'an (kindness towards parents) Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Quhafah and his wife. (His mother beareth him) in her womb (with reluctance) with hardship, (and bringeth him forth with reluctance) and delivers him in hardship, (and the bearing of him) in the womb of his mother (and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full strength) between the age of 18 to the age of 30 (and reacheth forty years, he saith) Abu Bakr says: (My Lord! Arouse me) inspire in me (that I may give thanks for the favour) of believing in Your divine Oneness (wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents) who by then had both accepted Islam, (and that I may do right) sincere righteous works which are (acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed) and honour my offspring with repentance and Islam, for 'Abd al-Rahman was not a Muslim by then; he became Muslim later. (Lo! I have turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender (unto Thee)) following their religion."
