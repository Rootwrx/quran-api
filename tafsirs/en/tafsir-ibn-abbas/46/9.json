  "text": "(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I am no new thing among the messengers (of Allah)) I am not the first human being to be sent as Messenger, there were many messengers before me, (nor know I what will be done with me or with you) in relation to hardship, comfort and well-being; it is also said that this verse was revealed about some of the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who asked him about when to leave Mecca in order to escape from the persecution of the disbelievers. So the Prophet (pbuh) said: \ufffdI do not know what will be done with me or with you; nor whether we should migrate from Mecca or not\ufffd. (I do but follow) act upon (that which is inspired in me) that which I am commanded in the Qur'an, (and I am but a plain warner) a warning messenger who addresses you in a language that you understand."
