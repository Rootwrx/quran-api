  "text": "(Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Have ye thought on) inform me about (all that ye invoke) worship (beside Allah) of idols? (Show me what they have created of the earth) what have they created of that which is in the earth. (Or have they any portion in the heavens) or had they any help in the creation of heavens? (Bring me a Scripture before this (Scripture)) before this Qur'an to substantiate your claim, (or some vestige of knowledge) or a report from the men of knowledge; and it is said: a vestige of knowledge from past prophets ((in support of what you say), if ye are truthful) in what you say."
