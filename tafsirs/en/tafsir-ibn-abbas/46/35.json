  "text": "(Then have patience) O Muhammad in the face of the disbelievers' harm (even as the stout of heart) as those possessed of certainty and resolve (among the messengers (of old)) such as Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus; it is also said that this means: such as those possessed of toughness and patience like Noah, Job, Zachariah and John (had patience, and seek not to hasten on the doom for them. On the day when they see that which they are promised) of doom ((it will seem to them) as though they had tarried) in the life of the world (but an hour of daylight. A clear message). And when the time of chastisement and destruction comes, (Shall any be destroyed) through such a chastisement (save evil-living folk) save the disbelievers, those who had denied and barred people from the way of Allah?'"
