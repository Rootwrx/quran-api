(Say) to them O Muhammad (If I have invented it) if I have invented the Qur'an as you claim, (still ye have no power to support me against Allah) against Allah's torment. (He is best aware of what ye say among yourselves concerning it) He is best aware of the lies in which you engage concerning the Qur'an. (He sufficeth) Allah suffices (for a witness between me and you) that I am Allah's Messenger and this Qur'an is His speech. (And He is the Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents amongst you, (the Merciful) towards anyone who dies repentant."
