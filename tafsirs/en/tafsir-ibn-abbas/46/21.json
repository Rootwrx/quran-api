  "text": "(And make mention) O Muhammad to the disbelievers of Mecca (of the brother of 'Aad) the Prophet of the Banu 'Aad, i.e. Hud (when he warned his folk among the wind-curved sandhills) He says: he warned his folk of the mountains of fire; it is also said: he warned his people from a mountain near Yemen; and it is said: near Historic Syria; and it is said: from the mountain of al-Raml; and it is said in a place near Yemen, (and verily warners came and went before) before Hud (and after him) and after Hud (saying: Serve none but Allah) Hud said to them: declare the divine Oneness of none other than Allah. (Lo! I fear for you) I know that (the doom of a tremendous Day) a severe torment will befall you if you reject faith."
