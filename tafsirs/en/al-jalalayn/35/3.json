Is there any creator min khāliqin min is extra; khāliq is the subject other than God read ghayru’Llāhi or gharyri’Llāhi as an adjectival qualification of khāliq ‘creator’ either concording with the oblique form of min khāliqin or concording with the syntactical status thereof; the predicate of the subject is the following who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth? vegetation the interrogative is actually an affirmative that is to say ‘there is no creator or provider other than Him. There is no god except Him. So how then do you deviate? how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the Creator and the Provider?"
