So do they expect do they await anything but the precedent of the ancients? God’s way of dealing with them such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you will never find any change in God’s precedent and you will never find any revision in God’s precedent that is to say chastisement is never replaced by anything else nor is it ever meted out other than to the one who deserves it."
