To Him ascends good words that is to say He is aware of such good words and these are statements such as ‘there is no god except God’ and the like; and as for righteous action He exalts it He accepts it; but those who plot evil schemes against the Prophet — as was the case at the council assembly in the way of imprisoning him killing him or expelling him as mentioned in sūrat al-Anfāl Q. 830 — theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing it shall be ruined."
