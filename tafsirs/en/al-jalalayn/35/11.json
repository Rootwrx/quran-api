  "text": "And God created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of seminal fluid in other words from sperm by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge illā bi-‘ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘except that it is known by Him’ and no long-living person is given long life in other words the life of none is increased for one who has a long life nor is anything diminished of his life in other words of the life of that same long-living person or some other long-living person but it is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God."
