And should one soul burdened heavily with sin call for some of its burden to be borne by another nothing of it will be borne even if the one called be a relative kin such as a father or a son — the impossibility of ‘having something borne by another’ in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret in other words those who fear Him despite not having seen Him for they are the ones to benefit from the warning and observe the prayer maintain performance of it. For whoever purifies himself cleansing himself of idolatry and other similar abominations is purifying himself only for the sake of his own soul because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the end of the journeying the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds."
