So whoever disbelieves of you his disbelief will be to his own detriment that is the evil consequences of his disbelief will be so. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except disfavour wrath. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss of the reward of the Hereafter."
