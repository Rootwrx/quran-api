Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves by failing to act fully in accordance with it and some of them are moderate acting in accordance with it most of the time and some are those who take the lead in performing good works so that in addition to his acquiring knowledge he disseminates it and shows others the way to proper conduct as well as acting in accordance with the Qur’ān by the leave of God by His will. That bequest to them of the Book is the greatest favour!"
