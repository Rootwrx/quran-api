God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with the truth and an appointed term for that creation at the conclusion of which this creation will perish and after which will be the Resurrection. But indeed many people that is to say such as the Meccan disbelievers disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord that is they do not believe in resurrection after death."
