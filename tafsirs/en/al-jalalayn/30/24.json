  "text": "And of His signs is His showing you lightning to arouse fear in the traveller of storms and hope in the one not travelling of the coming of the rain; and He sends down water from the heaven and with it He revives the earth after it has died that is after it has dried out so that it produces vegetation once again. Surely in that mentioned there are signs for people who understand a people who reflect."
