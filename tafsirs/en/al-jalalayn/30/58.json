And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you O Muhammad (s) were to bring them a miraculous sign such as the staff or the hand in the case of Moses those who disbelieve from among them will certainly say la-yaqūlanna the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw replaced by the damma in lu because of two unvocalised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person ‘You — in other words Muhammad (s) and his Companions — are nothing but followers of falsehood’."
