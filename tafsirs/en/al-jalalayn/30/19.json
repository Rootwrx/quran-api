  "text": "He brings forth the living from the dead as in the case of the human being who is produced from a sperm-drop and a bird from an egg and He brings forth the dead a sperm-drop or an egg from the living and He revives the earth with vegetation after it has died dried out. And in such a manner of being brought forth you shall be brought forth from the graves read either as the active takhrujūna ‘you shall come forth’ or the passive tukhrajūna ‘you shall be brought forth’."
