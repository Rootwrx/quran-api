  "text": "If you do not help him that is the Prophet s know that God has already helped him when the disbelievers drove him forth from Mecca that is they made him resort to leaving when they desired to kill him or imprison him or banish him at the council assembly — the second of two thāniya ithnayn this is a circumstantial qualifier that is one of two the other being Abū Bakr in other words just as God helped him in such a situation He will not forsake him in another; when idh substitutes for the previous idh the two were in the cave — a breach in the mountain called Thawr — when idh substituting again he said to his companion Abū Bakr — who upon perceiving the sound of the feet of the idolaters nearby had said to him ‘If one of them should merely look below his feet he will definitely see us!’ — ‘Do not despair; verily God is with us’ assisting us. Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon him His reassurance — some say this means upon the Prophet others that it means upon Abū Bakr — and supported him that is the Prophet s with legions of angels you did not see both in the cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved that is the call to idolatry the nethermost the one vanquished and the Word of God that is the profession of His Oneness shahāda was the uppermost the one prevailing and triumphant. And God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions."
