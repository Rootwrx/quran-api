  "text": "Verily the number of months used to reckon the year with God is twelve months in the Book of God the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz from the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them that is the months are sacred inviolable Dhū’l-Qa‘da Dhū’l-Hijja Muharram and Rajab. That making of them sacred is the right the upright religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them during these sacred months with acts of disobedience for their burden of sin is greater therein; but it is also said to mean do not wrong yourselves at any time during all the months of the year. And fight the idolaters altogether all of them throughout the months even as they fight you altogether; and know that God is with those who fear Him supporting and assisting them."
