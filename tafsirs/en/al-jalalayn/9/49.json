  "text": "And there are some of them who say ‘Grant me leave to stay behind and do not lead me into temptation’ this was al-Jadd b. Qays to whom the Prophet s said ‘Will you do battle against the Byzantines?’ and to which he replied ‘I am infatuated with women and I fear that if I were to see these Byzantine women I shall not be able to stay away from them and be led into temptation’. God exalted be He says Surely they have already fallen into temptation! by staying behind a variant reading for saqatū ‘they have fallen’ has the singular form saqat ‘he has fallen’. And surely Hell shall encompass the disbelievers for whom there shall be no escape therefrom."
