  "text": "Indeed God has purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions that they expend it in obedience of Him — for example by striving in His way — so that theirs will be the reward of Paradise they shall fight in the way of God and they shall kill and be killed this sentence is independent and constitutes an explication of the above-mentioned ‘purchase’; a variant reading has the passive verb come first sc. fa-yuqtalūna wa-yaqtulūn ‘they shall be killed and shall kill’ meaning that some of them are killed while those who remain fight on; that is a promise which is binding both wa‘dan ‘promise’ and haqqan ‘binding’ are verbal nouns and are in the accusative on account of their omitted implicit verbs upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’ān; and who fulfils his covenant better than God? that is no one is better in fulfilling it. Rejoice then there is a shift from the third to second person here in this bargain of yours which you have made for that bargain is the supreme triumph the one that secures the ultimate goal."
