  "text": "Abrahamâ€™s prayer for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made to him when he said to him I will ask my Lord forgiveness for you Q. 1947 in the hope that he would submit to God; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God upon his death as an disbeliever he declared himself innocent of him and refrained from asking forgiveness for him; truly Abraham was soft of heart making frequent entreaty and supplication to God forbearing enduring harm patiently."
