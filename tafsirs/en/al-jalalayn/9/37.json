  "text": "Postponement of the sacred month — that is the deferment of the sacredness of a given month to another as they used to do during paganism such as postponing the sacredness of Muharram if it arrives while they are at war to Safar — is only an excess of unbelief because of their rejection of God’s ruling thereof whereby those who disbelieve are led astray yudallu may also be read yadillu ‘they go astray’ one year they make it the month postponed profane and hallow it another that they may make up by profaning one month and hallowing another in its place the number of months which God has hallowed such that they do not hallow more or less than the four months but without observing the individual months themselves; and so they profane what God has hallowed. Their evil deeds have been adorned for them such that they deem them to be good deeds; and God does not guide the disbelieving folk."
