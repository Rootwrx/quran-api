  "text": "How can the idolaters have a pact with God and His Messenger — they cannot —while they disbelieve in God and His Messenger acting treacherously; except for those with whom you made a pact at the Sacred Mosque? the day of al-Hudaybiyya — these were Quraysh for whom an exception was made earlier Q. 94. So long as they are true to you keeping to the pact and not breaking it be true to them by fulfilling it fa-mā ‘so long as’ the mā is a conditional particle. Truly God loves the God-fearing the Prophet s had kept to the pact made with them until they broke it by supporting the Banū Bakr against Khuzā‘a."
