  "text": "And there are others from among those who stayed behind who are deferred read murja’ūna or murjawna whose repentance is delayed to God’s command concerning them according to His will whether He chastises them by causing them to die without their having made any repentance or relents to them; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them. These others mentioned are the three who will be mentioned afterwards Murāra b. al-Rabī‘ Ka‘b b. Mālik and Hilāl b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others however they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet s and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days during which time people avoided them until it was later revealed that God had relented to them."
