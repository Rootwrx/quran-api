If We forgive read passive yu‘fa ‘it is forgiven’ or active first person plural na‘fu ‘We forgive’ a party of you because of its sincerity and its repentance as in the case of Jahsh b. Humayyir We will chastise read either passive tu‘adhdhab ‘it shall be chastised’ or nu‘adhdhib another party because they were sinners’ persisting in hypocrisy and mockery."
