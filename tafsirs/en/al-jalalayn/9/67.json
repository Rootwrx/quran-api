  "text": "The hypocrites both men and women are of one another that is they resemble one another in religion as pieces of an individual entity they enjoin indecency unbelief and acts of disobedience and forbid decency faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut from expending in obedience of God; they have forgotten God they have abandoned obedience of Him so He has forgotten them He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites they are the wicked."
