  "text": "And among those around you O inhabitants of Medina of the Bedouins there are hypocrites such as the tribes of Aslam Ashja‘ and Ghifār and among the townspeople of Medina there are also hypocrites who are obstinate in hypocrisy engrossed in it and persisting in it. You do not know them — an address to the Prophet s — but We know them and We shall chastise them twice by disgracing them or having them killed in this world and by way of punishment in the grave then they will be returned in the Hereafter to a terrible chastisement namely the Fire."
