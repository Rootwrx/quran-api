  "text": "And of them the hypocrites are those who injure the Prophet by casting aspersions on him and communicating to others what he says in confidence saying when they are forbidden from doing this lest it should reach him ‘He is only a listener!’ that is he listens to anything that is said and accepts it so that when we swear to him that we have not communicated to others a particular thing he believes us. Say he is ‘A listener who listens to good for you and not one who listens to evil one who believes in God and has faith he trusts in the believers in what they inform him and not in others the lām of li’l-mu’minīna ‘in the believers’ has been added to distinguish between belief in the sense of ‘submitting to God’ islām and in other senses such as ‘trusting’ and who is a mercy read rahmatun in the nominative as a supplement to udhunun ‘a listener’ or rahmatin in the genitive as a supplement to khayrin ‘to good’ to those of you who believe. Those who injure God’s Messenger for them there is a painful chastisement’."
