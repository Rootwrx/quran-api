  "text": "And those Bedouins who had an excuse al-mu‘adhdhirūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl in other words it would usually be read as al-mu‘tadhirūn which itself is a variant reading those of them who were excused came to the Prophet s asking for leave to stay behind on account of their excuses and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messenger by feigning belief those hypocrites among the Bedouin stayed behind refraining from coming to give their excuses — a painful chastisement shall befall those of them who disbelieve."
