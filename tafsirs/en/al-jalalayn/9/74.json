  "text": "They the hypocrites swear by God that they said nothing of the defamation that has reached you as being from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their submission to God they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission to God. And they purposed that which they never attained in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of al-‘Aqaba upon his return from Tabūk — there were about ten to twenty of them and ‘Ammār b. Yāsir struck the faces of their riding camels when they came against him and were thus repulsed; and they were only spiteful they detested that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty by way of spoils when they had been in dire need the meaning is that this was all that they attained from him which is nothing to be spiteful about. So if they repent of hypocrisy and believe in you it will be better for them; but if they turn away from belief God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world by having them killed and in the Hereafter in the Fire and they have none on earth as protector to guard them from Him or helper to defend them."
