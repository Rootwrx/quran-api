  "text": "These days of the month of Ramadān wherein the Qur’ān was revealed from the Preserved Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr from Him a guidance hudan ‘a guidance’ is a circumstantial qualifier guiding away from error for the people and as clear proofs lucid verses of the Guidance the rulings that guide to truth and of the Criterion that discriminates between truth and falsehood; So let those of you who are present at the month fast it and if any of you be sick or if he be on a journey then a number of other days this concession has already been mentioned but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the comprehensive implication of man shahida ‘who are present’. God desires ease for you and desires not hardship for you and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fast during illness or travel this ease being the very reason He has commanded you to fast; He supplements the previous statement with and that you fulfil read tukmilū or tukammilū the number of the fasting days of Ramadān and magnify God when you have completed them for having guided you for having directed you to the principal rites of His religion and that you might be thankful to God for this."
