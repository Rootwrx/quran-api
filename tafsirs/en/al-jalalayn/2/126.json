  "text": "And when Abraham said ‘My Lord make this place a land secure in which there is safety God granted him his request making it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed no injustice is committed towards anyone no prey is hunted and which is never deserted in any of its parts; and provide its people with fruits something which actually happened when there came itinerants from as far as Syria whereas before it had been devoid of any vegetation or water; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day’ this phrase stands in place of its people and they are here singled out for mention in the request in accordance with God’s saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers; He exalted said ‘And whoever disbelieves I will also provide with fruits to him I shall give enjoyment read either umti‘uhu or umatti‘uhu by granting him sustenance in this life a little the length of his life but then I shall compel him I shall drive him in the Hereafter to the chastisement of the Fire so that he cannot find an escape — how evil a journey’s end!’ a place to which to return."
