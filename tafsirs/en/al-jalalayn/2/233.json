  "text": "Mothers shall suckle their children for two full years kāmilayn ‘two full ones’ is an adjective for emphasis; this is for such as desire to fulfil the suckling and this is the maximum length of time. It is for the father to provide food for them the mothers and clothe them during the suckling if they be divorced honourably to the best of his ability. No soul is charged save to its capacity its ability; a mother shall not be harmed by her child that is on account of the child by being forced to suckle it if she does not want to; neither should a father be harmed by his child that is on account of it by being charged with more than he is able to bear. The mention of both parents here in relation to the child is intended to show sympathy for both. The heir the one inheriting from his father that is the young man who is the trustee of his father’s property has a similar duty to that of the father in terms of providing sustenance and clothing for the other parent. But if the two parents desire by mutual consent agreement and consultation so that the child’s best interests are clear to wean that is to effect ablactation before the completion of the two-year period then they would not be at fault in this matter. And if you addressing the parents desire to seek nursing from other than the mothers for your children you would not be at fault in this respect provided you hand over to them what you have given what you intend to give them in the way of wages honourably in kindness and good nature; and fear God and know that God sees what you do and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him."
