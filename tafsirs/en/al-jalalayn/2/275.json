  "text": "Those who devour that is those who seize by way of usury which is an excess levied in transactions of money or foodstuffs either on their value or on credit shall not rise again from their graves except rising as one whom Satan has made prostrate demented from touch through madness min al-mass ‘from touch’ is semantically connected to yaqūmūna ‘they rise’; that which befalls them is because of the fact that they say ‘Trade is like usury’ in terms of permissibility this statement is a type of reversed simile used for intensity sc. ‘usury is like trade’ is the expected word order. God responds to them saying that God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists from devouring it he shall have his past gains those made before the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him and his affair with regard to pardoning him is committed to God; but whoever reverts to devouring it treating it like trade in terms of lawfulness — those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein."
