  "text": "Those to whom We have given the Scripture they recognise him Muhammad (s) as they recognise their sons because of the descriptions of him in their Scripture ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Salām said ‘I recognised him the moment I saw him as I would my own son; but my recognition of Muhammad (s) was more intense’; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth that is his description while they know this truth which you Muhammad (s) follow."
