  "text": "We have indeed qad ‘indeed’ is for affirmation seen you turning your face about in the direction of the heaven looking around for the Revelation and longing for the command to face the Ka‘ba he the Prophet wished for this because it was the prayer-direction of Abraham and would be more conducive to the submission of the Arabs to Islam; now We will surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you that you will love. Turn your face in prayer towards the Sacred Mosque that is the Ka‘ba and wherever you are addressing the Muslim community turn your faces in prayer towards it. Those who have been given the Scripture know that it the change towards the Ka‘ba is the fixed truth from their Lord on account of the description in their Scripture of how the Prophet s would re-orient himself to it; God is not heedless of what you do O believers when you obey His command alternatively ta‘malūna ‘you do’ can be read ya‘malūna ‘they do’ in other words it would be referring to the Jews’ denial of the matter concerning the direction of prayer."
