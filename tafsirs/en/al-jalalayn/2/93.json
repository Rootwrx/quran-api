Say to them ‘Evil is that thing which your belief in the Torah enjoins on you in the way of the worship of the golden calf if you are believers’ in it as you claim; meaning you are not believers for faith does not command that you worship the calf — their forefathers are meant here. Likewise you do not believe in the Torah because you have denied the prophethood of Muhammad (s) whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him."
