  "text": "Do not make God by swearing in His Name a hindrance a cause of impediment in your oaths that is setting up such impediments by swearing in His Name frequently so as not to be pious and God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful and result in perjury which requires a redemption effected by doing the opposite of the oath such as performing righteous deeds and so forth which constitute an act of obedience; and to put things right between people this means do not be prevented from doing righteous deeds as mentioned just because you swore against them; nay do them and make redemption; this understanding of the verse is justified by the reason for its revelation namely their refraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing of what you say Knower of your circumstances."
