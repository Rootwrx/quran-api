In other words in whichever way you can facing the direction of the qibla or otherwise making the gestures of genuflexion and prostration; but when you are secure from any fear then remember God by performing prayer as He taught you what you knew not before He taught you its obligations and its proper ways the particle kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ has the same meaning as mithl ‘like’ while the mā is related to the verbal action or is relative."
