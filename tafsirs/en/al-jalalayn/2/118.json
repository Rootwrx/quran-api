So in the same way that these disbelievers have spoken spoke those before them from among past communities to their prophets the like of what they say in their obstinacy and demand for signs; their hearts are much alike in terms of unbelief and stubbornness this is meant as consolation for the Prophet s. Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain a people who know that these are God’s signs and so they believe in them for to request other signs would be obduracy."
