Jerusalem or it was revealed when the idolaters barred the Prophet s from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them save in fear illā khā’ifīna is a predicate also functioning as a command that is to say ‘Frighten them by threats of waging war against them so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure’; for them in this world is degradation debasement through being killed taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the Hereafter a mighty chastisement namely the Fire."
