He was a wealthy elderly man and went to ask the Prophet s what and for whom he should expend; Say to them ‘Whatever you expend of good min khayrin ‘of good’ is an explication of mā ‘whatever’ covering small and large amounts and denotes one half of the question represented by the expender; God responds with regard to the one receiving the expenditure this pertaining to the other half of the question in the following it is for parents and kinsmen orphans the needy and the traveller that is they are the most deserving of it; and whatever good you may do by way of expending or otherwise God has knowledge of it’ and will requite it accordingly."
