And whatever good property you expend is for yourselves since the reward is for you; for then you are expending desiring only Godâ€™s Face this clause is the predicate denoting a prohibition that is to say His reward and not any other transient object of this world and whatever good you expend its requital shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged you will not suffer any diminishment of it both of the last two sentences emphasise the first one."
