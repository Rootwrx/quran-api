Salām and his companions who after converting to Islam still observed the Sabbath with reverence and were averse to the consumption of camels O you who believe come all of you into submission read al-salm or al-silm that is Islam; kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-silm meaning into all of its precepts; and follow not the steps the ways of Satan that is his temptations to you by way of creating divisions; he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is obvious."
