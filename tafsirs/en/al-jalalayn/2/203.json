If any man hastens on his departure from Minā in two days that is on the second day of tashrīq after he has cast his stones that hastening is no sin for him; and if he delays such that he stays until the third night and cast his stones it is not a sin for him that is they have the choice of either for the sin has been precluded in both cases; if he fears God during his pilgrimage — for such a person is truly a pilgrim — and fear God and know that to Him you shall be gathered in the Hereafter that He may requite you for your deeds."
