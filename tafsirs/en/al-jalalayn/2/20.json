  "text": "The lightning well-nigh almost snatches away their sight that is takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it in its light; and when the darkness is over them they stop that is they stand still a simile of the perturbation that the Qur’ānic arguments cause in their hearts and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and their sight that is the exterior faculty in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly God has power over all things that He wills as for example His taking away of the above-mentioned."
