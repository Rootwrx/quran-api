  "text": "When you divorce women and they have reached completed their term of waiting do not debar them — addressing the guardians here — from marrying their divorced husbands when they the male spouses and their women have agreed together honourably in accordance with the Law. The occasion for the revelation of this verse was Ma‘qil b. Yasār’s sister was divorced by her husband who then wanted to restore her but Ma‘qil refused as reported by al-Hākim. That the prohibition against debarring is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day because it is for the benefit of such a person; that refraining from debarring is purer for you better and cleaner for you and for them bearing in mind the suspicion that can be aroused by the couple on account of prior intimacy. God knows what is in your interest and you know not any of this so follow His commands."
