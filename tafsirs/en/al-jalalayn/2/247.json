  "text": "Then their prophet said to them ‘Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king’ They said ‘How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship since he is not of the tribe of monarchs or that of prophets; he Saul was a tanner or a shepherd; seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?’ which he can use to establish a kingdom. He the prophet said to them ‘God has chosen him over you for kingship and has increased him broadly amply in knowledge and body at that time he was the most knowledgeable and the most handsome of all the Children of Israel and the most perfect of character. God gives the kingship to whom He will in the way He does and there can be no objection; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing of those who deserve it."
