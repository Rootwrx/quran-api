Yāsir and Suhayb al-Rūmī mocking them and treating them condescendingly with their wealth; but those who fear idolatry namely those mentioned shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning with ample sustenance in the Hereafter or in this world when He gives to those that were mocked possession of the property and lives of those that mocked them."
