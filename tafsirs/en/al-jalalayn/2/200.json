  "text": "And when you have performed and completed your holy rites that is the devotions pertaining to your pilgrimage having cast stones at the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba performed the circumambulation and stopped at Minā remember God by extolling Him and repeating the takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ as you remember your fathers as you used to remember them and boast about them at the end of your pilgrimage or yet more intensely than your remembrance of them ashadda is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr ‘remembrance’ which itself is in the accusative as the object of udhkurū ‘remember’ because had it come after it it would have functioned as an adjectival phrase. There are some people who say ‘Our Lord give to us our lot in this world’ and they are given it; such people will have no part no lot in the Hereafter."
