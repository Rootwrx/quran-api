  "text": "They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about the new moons ahilla plural of hilāl ‘Why do they seem very thin and then wax until they are full of light and then wane again as at the first and are not always the same in the way that the sun is?’ Say to them ‘They are appointed times mawāqīt is the plural of mīqāt for the people for them to know the times for sowing the land for business for their women’s waiting periods their fast and their breaking it and the Pilgrimage’ wa’l-hajji and the Pilgrimage’ is a supplement to li’l-nāsi ‘for the people’ that is to say appointed times by which its season is known for if they the new moons always looked the same none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs in your state of pilgrimage inviolability ihrām when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability and fear God that you may prosper that you may triumph."
