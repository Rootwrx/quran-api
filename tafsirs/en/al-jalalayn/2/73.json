  "text": "so We said ‘Smite him the slain man with part of it’ and so when he was struck with its tongue or its tail he came back to life and said ‘So-and-so killed me’ and after pointing out two of his cousins he died; the two killers were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says even so is the revival for God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs the proofs of His power so that you might understand that you might reflect and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is also capable of reviving a multitude of souls and then believe."
