Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you because the soul inclines towards those desires which result in its destruction and its rejection of the religious obligations that would bring about its happiness. Perhaps then even if you are averse to it you will find much good in fighting as a result of victory booty martyrdom or reward; while if you were to reject fighting even if you would like to do so you will find much evil because then you may be subjugated impoverished and denied the reward; God knows what is good for you and you know this not so strive in what He commands you."
