  "text": "O Muslims Do not marry idolatresses disbelievers until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her because of her beauty and wealth this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture as indicated by the verse Q. 55 lawful to you are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture. And do not marry off believing women to idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him for his wealth and good looks. Those the people of idolatry call to the Fire because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls through the voice of His prophets to Paradise and pardon that is to the deeds that merit these two by His leave by His will so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember that they might be admonished."
