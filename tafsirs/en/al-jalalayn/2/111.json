  "text": "And they say ‘None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews hūd is the plural of hā’id or Christians’ this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najrān said when they disputed with the Prophet s each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such sayings are their desires their false passions. Say to them ‘Produce your proof your evidence for this if you speak truly’ in this matter."
