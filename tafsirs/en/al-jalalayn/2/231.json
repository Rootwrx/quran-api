  "text": "When you divorce women and they have very nearly reached the end of their term then retain them by returning to them honourably not harming them or set them free honourably or leave them until their term is completed; do not retain them when reverting in harm dirāran is an object denoting reason to transgress that is so as to force them to redemption or to repudiate them or confine them indoors for a long time; whoever does that has wronged his soul by exposing it to God’s chastisement; take not God’s verses in mockery in jest by contravening them and remember God’s grace upon you that is Islam and the Book the Qur’ān and the wisdom the rulings contained therein He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith so that you should give thanks by acting in accordance with it; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things and nothing can be hidden from Him."
