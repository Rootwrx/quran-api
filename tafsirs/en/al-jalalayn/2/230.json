  "text": "If he the husband divorces her after the two utterances of divorce; she shall not be lawful to him after that after the third utterance of divorce until she marries another husband who has sexual intercourse with her as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. If he the second husband divorces her then neither of them would be at fault that is the woman and her first husband to return to each other in wedlock after the completion of the waiting period if they think that they will maintain God’s bounds. Those matters mentioned are God’s bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge a people who reflect."
