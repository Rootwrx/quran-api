  "text": "God there is no god that is there is none worthy of being worshipped in all existence except Him the Living the Everlasting the Eternal Sustainer the One constantly engaged in the management of His creation. Slumber does not seize Him neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants; who is there that is to say none is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave? in this for him. He knows what lies before them that is creation and what is after them of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge that is they know nothing of what He knows save such as He wills to inform of it by way of His messengers. His throne subsumes the heavens and the earth it is said that His knowledge encompasses them both; it is also said that the kursī ‘throne’ itself subsumes them on account of its vastness as in the hadīth ‘The seven heavens compared to the kursī are like seven silver coins lying in a metal shield of armour’; the preserving of them the heavens and the earth wearies Him not does not burden Him; He is the Sublime above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Tremendous the Great."
