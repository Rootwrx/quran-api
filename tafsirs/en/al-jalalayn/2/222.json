  "text": "They will ask you about the monthly period that is menstruation and the spot in which it occurs and how should one treat women during it. Say ‘It is an ailment filth or the place whence it issues is so; so part with women refrain from sexual intercourse with them in the monthly period in this time or in the part affected; and do not approach them for sexual intercourse until they are pure yathurna or yattahharna the original tā’ of yatatahharna has been assimilated with the tā’ that is until they have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them in sexual intercourse as God has commanded you’ by avoiding it the female organ during menstruation and not resorting to any other part. Truly God loves that is He rewards and honours those who repent of sins and He loves those who cleanse themselves from impurities."
