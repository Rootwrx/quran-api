  "text": "O you who believe annul not the rewards of your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury as in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent of intense rain smites it and leaves it barren and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power lā yaqdirūna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the potential plural implication of alladhī ‘the one who’ over anything that they have earned that they did in other words they find no reward for it in the Hereafter just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk."
