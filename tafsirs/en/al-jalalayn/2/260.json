  "text": "And mention when Abraham said ‘My Lord show me how You give life to the dead’ He God exalted be He said to him ‘Why do you not believe?’ in My power to revive; God asks him this even though He knows of his belief in this power as a response to his request and so that the ones listening will know the purpose of the request; ‘Yes’ I do believe he said ‘but I ask You so that my heart may be re-assured’ so that it may be at peace through direct vision in addition to that certainty which is sought through logical reasoning. Said He ‘Take four birds and twist them to you sirhunna or surhunna turn them towards you cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers then set a part of them on every hill in the land around you then summon them to you and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty that nothing is beyond Him Wise’ in His actions. Abraham took a peacock an eagle a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned but kept their heads with him. He called them and all the parts began to fly back together combining until they were whole and returning to their heads."
