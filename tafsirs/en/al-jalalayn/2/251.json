Had God not repelled people some ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for saying ba‘dan min al-nās ‘some people’ by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims and mosques being destroyed; but God is bounteous to all worlds by repelling some by means of others."
