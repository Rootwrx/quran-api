  "text": "The Pilgrimage the time for it is in months well-known Shawwāl Dhū’l-Qa’da and ten nights some say all of Dhū’l Hijja; whoever undertakes upon himself the duty of Pilgrimage during them by entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability then no lewdness no sexual intercourse for them nor wickedness nor acts of disobedience or disputing or quarrelling in the Pilgrimage a variant reading for fa-lā rafathun wa-lā fusūqun wa-lā jidāla has the accusative for all three nouns sc. fa-lā rafatha wa-lā fusūqa wa-lā jidāla; prohibition is meant in all three cases. Whatever good you do by way of voluntary almsgiving God knows it and will reward you for it. And take provision to suffice you your journey this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them thus becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety taqwā ‘piety’ literally ‘guarding’ with which you are able to guard against asking others for things; and fear you Me O people of pith! O possessors of intellect."
