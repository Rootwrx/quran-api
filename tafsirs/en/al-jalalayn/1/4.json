  "text": "Master of the Day of Judgement that is the day of requite the Day of Resurrection. The reason for the specific mention of the Day of Judgement is that the mastery of none shall appear on that Day except that of God may He be exalted as is indicated by God’s words ‘Whose is the Kingdom today?’ ‘God’s’ Q. 4016 if one reads it mālik as opposed to malik then this signifies that He has possession of the entire affair on the Day of Resurrection or else that He is ever described by this expression in the same way as He is described as ‘Forgiver of sin’ ghāfir al-dhanb. Thus one can validly take it as an adjective of a definite noun."
