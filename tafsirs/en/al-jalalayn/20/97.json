  "text": "Said he Moses to him ‘Begone! It shall be yours as your lot throughout life that is for the duration of your life to say to whomever you may see “Do not touch me!” that is do not come near me — he used to wander about aimlessly throughout the land and whenever he touched a person or a person touched him both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a tryst for you for you to be chastised which you will not fail to keep read lan tukhlifahu meaning ‘a tryst which you shall not miss’; or lan tukhlafahu ‘for which you will not be forgotten’ meaning ‘nay you will be sent forth to keep it’. Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! zalta is actually zalilta but the first lām has been omitted in order to soften it that is to say you remained by his your god’s side worshipping him. We will surely burn it in fire and then scatter the ashes of it into the waters we will disperse it into the winds of the sea; and after having slaughtered it Moses did exactly that which he has mentioned."
