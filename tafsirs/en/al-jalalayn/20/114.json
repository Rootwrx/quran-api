And do not hasten with the Qur’ān that is to recite it before its revelation is completed for you before Gabriel is through delivering it and say ‘My Lord increase me in knowledge’ that is knowledge of the Qur’ān thus every time something of it was revealed to him his knowledge increased because of it."
