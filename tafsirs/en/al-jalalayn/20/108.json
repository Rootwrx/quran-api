  "text": "On that day that is on the day the mountains are scattered as ashes they will follow that is mankind will follow after rising from their graves the Summoner to the Gathering by the call of his voice — this Summoner will be the archangel Isrāfīl and he will say ‘Forward to the parade before God!’ — there will be no deviation therein that is in the manner in which they follow him in other words they cannot but follow him. Voices will be hushed will become silent before the Compassionate One so that you hear nothing but a faint shuffle the light tread of feet walking towards the Gathering similar to the sound of the hoofs of camels as they pass."
