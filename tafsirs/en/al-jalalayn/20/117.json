So do not let him cause you both to be expelled from the Garden so that you then toil so that you then become fatigued by the toil of tillage sowing harvesting milling baking and otherwise — the statement is restricted to the mention of his Adam’s ‘toil’ because it is the man who has to strive to provide for his wife."
