In that which is mentioned here there are indeed signs indeed lessons for people of sense possessors of intellect al-nuhā the plural of nuhya similar in pattern to ghurfa plural ghuraf. The intellect is called by this term nuhya because it shows a person the sense to refrain from committing vile deeds."
