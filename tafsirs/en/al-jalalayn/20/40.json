  "text": "When idh for explanation your sister Maryam walked up to obtain news of you for they had brought wet nurses for you but you would not take to the breast of any of them and she then said “Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?”. Her offer was accepted and so she brought them his mother and he took to her breasts. Thus We restored you to your mother that her eyes might rejoice in seeing you again and not grieve at that point anymore. Then you slew a soul namely the Copt in Egypt — and you became distressed for having slain him because of how Pharaoh would react; whereupon We delivered you from great distress and We tried you with various ordeals We tested you by landing you in some other ordeal and again delivered you from it. Then you stayed for several years ten years among the people of Midian after you had reached it having left Egypt staying with the prophet Shu‘ayb and marrying his daughter. Then you came hither as ordained in My knowledge with the Message that you will deliver — and this was when you were forty years old O Moses!"
