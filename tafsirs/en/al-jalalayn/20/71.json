He is indeed your chief your teacher who taught you sorcery. I shall assuredly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides min khilāfin a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘alternate hands and feet’ in other words the right hands and the left feet and I shall assuredly crucify you on the trunks of palm trees.
