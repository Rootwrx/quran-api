Q. 2190ff — and make glorifications pray by praising your Lord bi-hamdi rabbika is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘ensconced in such praise’ before the rising of the sun the morning prayer and before its setting — the afternoon prayer — and in the watches of the night during the hours thereof and make glorifications perform the sunset and the evening prayer and at either side of the day wa-atrāfa’l-nahāri a supplement to the syntactical locus of the accusative clause wa-min ānā’i ‘and in the watches’ in other words perform the noon prayer because the time for it begins at the point where the sun starts to go down which is the end side of the first half of the day and the start side of the second half of the day; that perhaps you may be pleased with the reward that you will be given."
