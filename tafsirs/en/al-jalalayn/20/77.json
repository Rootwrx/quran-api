  "text": "And verily We revealed to Moses saying ‘Lead My servants on a journey by night read as an asri ‘that lead on a journey by night’ from fourth form asrā ‘he travelled by night’; or read as an’isri from first form sarā ‘he travelled by night’ both being alternative forms in other words travel with them by night from the land of Egypt and strike for them make for them by striking your staff a dry path in the sea. So he fulfilled what he had been commanded and God made the ground dry so that they were able to pass through it. Do not fear to be overtaken that is fearing that Pharaoh might catch you and do not be afraid’ of drowning."
