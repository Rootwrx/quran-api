  "text": "And God has favoured some of you above others in respect of provision thus some of you are poor some are rich some owners others are owned. Now those who have been more favoured namely the masters would not hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess that is they would not assign that wealth and other things which We have given them as something to be shared equally between them and their slaves so that they that is the slaves and their masters become equal partners in respect thereof. The meaning is they do not have partners from among their slaves in respect of their wealth so how can they make certain of Godâ€™s servants partners of His? Is it then the grace of God that they deny? that they reject when they ascribe partners to Him?"
