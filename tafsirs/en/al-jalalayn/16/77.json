  "text": "And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth in other words the knowledge of what is hidden in them. And the matter of the Hour is but as the twinkling of an eye or it is even nearer since it takes place as a result of the words ‘Be’ and it is kun fa-yakūn. Truly God has power over all things."
