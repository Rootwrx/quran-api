And you see observe the ships ploughing therein ploughing through the water that is cleaving it as they sail upon it coming and going with the same wind; and that you may seek wa-li-tabtaghū is a supplement to li-ta’kulū ‘that you may eat’ of His bounty exalted He be by way of commerce and that you might be thankful to God for all that."
