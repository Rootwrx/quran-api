Is he that is the dumb one mentioned equal to one who enjoins justice that is to one who is able to speak of benefit to people since he enjoins it justice and encourages others to it and follows a path a way that is straight? — this being the second man the believer — No he is not equal to him. It is also said that this last similitude is a similitude of God while the similitude of the dumb one is of the idols so that the preceding verse contains the similitude of the disbeliever and the believer."
