  "text": "Indeed God enjoins justice — that is affirmation of His Oneness or actually being fair and virtue performance of the religious obligations or that you should worship God as if you were able to see Him as reported in the hadīth; and giving to kinsfolk — He has singled it kinship out for mention by way of highlighting its importance — and He forbids lewdness fornication and abomination with regard to the stipulations of the Law abomination such as disbelief and acts of disobedience and aggression wrongdoing against people — He also singles this out for mention by way of showing its importance; just as He began with the mention of ‘lewdness’ in this way He admonishes you through commands and prohibitions so that you might remember that you might be admonished tadhakkarūna ‘you might remember’ the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl. In the Mustadrak of al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī it is reported from Ibn Mas‘ūd that he said ‘This verse is the most comprehensive verse in the Qur’ān in terms of what is good and what is evil’."
