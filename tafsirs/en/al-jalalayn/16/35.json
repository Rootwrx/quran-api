  "text": "And the idolaters from among the Meccans say ‘Had God willed we would not have worshipped anything besides Him — neither we nor our fathers — nor would we have deemed anything sacred besides Him’ in the way of those camels called bahīras and sā’iba. In other words our idolatry and our deeming these animals sacred are effected by His will; therefore He must be satisfied with this. God exalted He be says So did those before them that is they denied their messengers regarding that which they the messengers brought them.
