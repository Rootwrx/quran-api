Nothing holds them when they draw in their wings or open them lest they fall except God by His power. Indeed in that there are signs for a people who believe the signs which are that they have been created in a way that enables them to fly as well as the creation of the air in such a way that it allows for flight and the holding of them up in the air so that they do not fall."
