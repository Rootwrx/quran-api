  "text": "By God We verily sent to communities before you messengers. But Satan adorned for them their deeds their evil deeds so that they considered them to be good deeds and therefore they denied the messengers. So he is their patron the guardian of their affairs today that is now in this world and for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm ‘today’ is meant the Day of Resurrection narrating the events as though they are taking place now. In other words they have no guardian other than him in other words Satan and as he is incapable of helping himself how could he possibly help them?"
