  "text": "Whoever disbelieves in God after having affirmed his faith — except for him who is compelled to pronounce a statement of unbelief and so pronounces it while his heart is at rest in faith man ‘whoever’ is either a subject or a conditional and so the predicate of this subject or the response to this conditional is an implied lahum wa‘īdun shadīd ‘there is for them a severe threat of chastisement’; this is indicated by the statement that follows — but he who opens up his breast to unbelief that is he who opens it up and expands it with unbelief meaning that his soul is content with it upon such shall be wrath from God and there is a great chastisement for them."
