  "text": "And mention the day when the mountains shall be set in motion — they shall be removed from the face of the earth and become ‘as scattered dust’ Q. 566 a variant reading for tusayyaru’l-jibālu has nusayyiru’l-jibāla ‘We shall set the mountains in motion’ and you will see the earth exposed manifest in full view with no mountain or anything else on top of it. And We shall gather them believers and disbelievers such that We will not leave out anyone of them."
