Indeed on their hearts We have cast veils coverings lest they should understand it that is lest they should comprehend the Qur’ān in other words and so as a result they do not comprehend it; and in their ears a deafness a heaviness and so they do not hear it; and though you call them to guidance they will not be guided in that case that is given the casting of veils mentioned ever."
