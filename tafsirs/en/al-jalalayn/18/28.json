  "text": "And restrain yourself detain yourself along with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His Countenance exalted be He and not any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor; and do not let your eyes overlook turn away from them — these the eyes are being used to refer to the person addressed — desiring the glitter of the life of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance that is to the Qur’ān — this was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions — and who follows his own whim by attributing partners to God and whose conduct is mere prodigality excess."
