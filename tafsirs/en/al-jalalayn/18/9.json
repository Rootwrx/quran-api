  "text": "Or did you think did you suppose that the Companions of the Cave the cavern in the mountain and the Inscription the tablet wherein their names and lineages had been inscribed — the Prophet s had been asked about their tale — were with regard to their tale a unique marvel from among the entirety of Our signs? ‘ajaban ‘a marvel’ is the predicate of the defective verb kāna sc. kānū the preceding min āyātinā ‘from among Our signs’ being a circumstantial qualifier. In other words did you suppose that they were a marvel exclusively from among all Our other signs or that they were the most marvellous among them? Not so."
