But the enduring things the righteous deeds — and these are ‘Glory be to God’ subhāna’Llāh ‘Praise be to God’ al-hāmdu li’Llāh ‘There is no god but God lā ilāha illā’Llāh ‘God is Great’ Allāhu akbar; some add the following ‘There is no power or strength except in God’ lā hawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh — these are better with your Lord for reward and better in respect of hope in other words they are better in terms of what a person hopes for and desires from God exalted be He."
