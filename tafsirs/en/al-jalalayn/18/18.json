And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left lest the earth consume their flesh and their dog lay stretching its forelegs his paws on the threshold at the opening of the cave whenever they turned over it would turn over just like them both during sleep and consciousness. If you had observed them you would have turned away from them in flight and you would have been filled read la-mulli’ta or la-muli’ta with awe because of them read ru‘ban or ru‘uban ‘awe’ it was through this awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them."
