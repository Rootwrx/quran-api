And you will see the guilty the disbelievers apprehensive fearful of what is in it and they will say when they observe the evil deeds recorded in it ‘O yā is for exclamation woe to us! O this is our destruction! this form waylatanā is a verbal noun but in this form it cannot be conjugated as a verb What is it with this Book that it leaves out neither small nor great from among our sins but instead it has counted it?’ enumerated it and fixed it in the record — they are stupefied by it in this respect. And they shall find all that they did present fixed in writing in their individual Book. And your Lord does not wrong anyone He does not punish him if he is without guilt nor does He diminish anything of the reward of a believer."
