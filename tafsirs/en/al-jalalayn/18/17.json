  "text": "And you might have seen the sun when it rose inclining read tazzāwaru or tazāwaru away from their Cave towards the right side of it and when it set go past them on the left avoid them and pass over them so that it does not fall on them at all while they were in a cavern therein in an ample space inside the Cave where the coolness and the gentle breeze of the winds reached them. That which is mentioned was one of God’s signs one of the proofs of His power. Whomever God guides he indeed is rightly guided and whomever He leads astray you will not find for him a guiding friend."
