They then found in it a wall one hundred cubits high about to collapse that is it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he al-Khidr straightened it with his own hands. He Moses said to him ‘Had you wished you could have taken a variant reading for la-ttakhadhta has la-takhidhta a wage for it’ some sort of payment since they did not extend us any hospitality despite our need for food."
