  "text": "And We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings to believers and as warners as threateners to disbelievers. But those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood when they say that ‘Has God sent a human as a messenger from Him?’ Q. 1794 and the like of such statements that they may refute thereby that by way of their disputing they may invalidate the truth the Qur’ān. And they have taken My signs namely the Qur’ān and that whereof they have been warned in the way of the Fire derisively in mockery."
