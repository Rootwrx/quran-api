  "text": "And say to him and to his companions that this Qur’ān is ‘The truth that comes from your Lord; so whoever will let him believe and whoever will let him disbelieve’ — this is meant as a threat to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers that is the disbelievers a Fire and they will be surrounded by its pavilion by that which encloses the Fire itself. If they cry out for help they will be succoured with water like molten copper like thick burning oil which scalds faces because of the intensity of its heat if it is brought near them. What an evil drink that is and how ill is the Fire as a resting-place! murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb in other words vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise How fair a resting-place below verse 31. For indeed what resting-place can there be in the Fire?"
