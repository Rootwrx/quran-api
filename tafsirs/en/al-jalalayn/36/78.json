  "text": "And he strikes for Us a similitude in this respect and forgets the manner of his creation from a sperm-drop a thing more curious than his similitude; he says ‘Who will revive the bones when they are rot?’ in other words when they have become withered He does not say ramīmatun ‘decayed’ because it ramīmun ‘rot’ is a noun and not an adjective. It is reported that he al-‘Āsī took some withered bones and crushed them into pieces and said to the Prophet s ‘Do you think that God can revive these bones after they have decayed and become rot?’ And so the Prophet s said ‘Yes indeed! And He will also throw you into the Fire’."
