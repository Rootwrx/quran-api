  "text": "because the blind man came to him ‘Abd Allāh son of Umm Maktūm who interrupted him while he was busy with those notables of Quryash whose submission to God he was very eager for. The blind man was not aware that he was busy with these and so he called out to him ‘Teach me of what God has taught you’. However the Prophet s went off to his house. He was then reproached for this with what was revealed in this sūra. Afterwards whenever he came to him the Prophet would say to him ‘Greetings to him on whose account God reproached me!’ and would lay down his cloak for him."
