He turns the night into day so that it grows and turns the day into night so that it grows and He has disposed the sun and the moon each running in its course for an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty Whose way always prevails Requiter of His enemies the ever Forgiving of His friends."
