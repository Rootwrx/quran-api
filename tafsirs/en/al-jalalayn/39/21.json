  "text": "Have you not seen realised that God sends down water from the heaven then conducts it as springs making it enter points of springs in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither they become dried-out and you see them for example after having been green turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Truly in that there is a reminder for people of pith possessors of intellect by which they may be reminded for it is an indication of Godâ€™s Oneness and His power."
