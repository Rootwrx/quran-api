  "text": "Is he whose breast God has opened to Islam and becomes guided so that he follows a light from his Lord …? like he whose heart He has sealed with disbelief? — this understanding of the ellipsis is indicated by what follows. So woe — an expression indicating ‘chastisement’ — to those whose hearts have been hardened against the remembrance of God that is hardened against the acceptance of the Qur’ān. Such are in manifest error."
