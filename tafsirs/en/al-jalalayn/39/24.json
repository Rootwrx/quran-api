  "text": "Is he who will be fending off is he who will encounter with his face the awful chastisement on the Day of Resurrection …? that is the most severe chastisement when he is flung into the Fire with his hands bound to his neck in fetters is he like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? And it will be said to the wrongdoers namely the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Taste now what you used to earn’ that is taste the requital for it."
