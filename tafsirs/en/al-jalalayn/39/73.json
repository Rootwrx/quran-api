  "text": "And those who feared their Lord will be driven gently to Paradise in troops until when they reach it and its gates are opened wa-futihat the wāw here indicates a circumstantial qualifier implying qad ‘already’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Peace be to you! You are good! tibtum a circumstantial qualifier So enter it to abide therein’ — enter it with the decree that you are to abide in it forever the response to idhā ‘when’ is implicit and is in other words dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’. The manner of their being driven as well as the opening of the gates before their arrival is a way of honouring them; the driving of the disbelievers however and the opening of the gates only upon their arrival so that all of its heat is retained for them is a means of humiliating them."
