  "text": "If you are ungrateful indeed God is Independent of you though He does not approve of ingratitude for His servants even if He should will it to manifest itself in some of them. And if you give thanks to God and thus become believers He will approve of it read yardah or yardahu either lengthening the vowel or not that is of such thankfulness for you. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another soul in other words it will not bear the responsibility for it. Then to your Lord will be your return whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of men."
