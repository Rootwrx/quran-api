  "text": "God strikes for the idolater and the believer in God’s Oneness a similitude a man rajulan substitutes for mathalan ‘a similitude’ shared by several masters quarrelling disputing ill-mannered and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? mathalan for specification in other words the slave of many masters is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve — which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter the slave of one is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God! alone. Nay but most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God."
