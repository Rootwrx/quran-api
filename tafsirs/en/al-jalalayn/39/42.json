  "text": "God takes the souls at the time of their death and He takes those that have not died in their sleep in other words He takes them during sleep. Then He retains those for whom He has ordained death and releases the others until an appointed term that is until the time of their death. The one that is released is the soul that possesses the faculty of discernment without which the soul containing the force of life is able to remain temporarily — but this cannot be the other way round. Truly in that mentioned there are signs indications for a people who reflect and then realise that the One with the power to do this also has the power to resurrect — Quraysh however never reflected on this fact."
