Say ‘Indeed the losers are those who will have lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection by condemning their souls to abide forever in the Fire and their failure to attaining the bliss promised among the black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly that is the manifest loss!’"
