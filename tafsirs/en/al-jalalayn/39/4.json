  "text": "Had God wanted to take a son — as they allege that He has ‘The Compassionate One has taken to Himself a son’ Q. 1988 He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed and taken it as a child instead of the angels whom they claim to be God’s daughters or their claim that ‘Ezra is the son of God’ or that ‘Jesus is the son of God’ cf. Q. 930. Glory be to Him in exaltation of Him as being above that He should take a child. He is God the One the All-Compelling over all His creatures."
