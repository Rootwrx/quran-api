No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me would they be able to withhold His mercy?’ No! a variant reading for the two clauses kāshifātun durrahu and mumsikātun rahmatahu has the genitive construction kāshifātu durrihi and mumsikātu rahmatihi. Say ‘God is sufficient for me. In Him do all the trusting put their trust’."
