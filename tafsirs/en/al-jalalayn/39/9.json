  "text": "Or is he who read softened a-man devotes himself in worship observing duties of obedience in the watches of the night during its hours prostrating and standing in prayer apprehensive of the eventuality of the Hereafter in other words fearing its chastisement and hoping for the mercy the Paradise of his Lord … ? like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? a variant reading has am-man pronouncing the hamza so that am has the sense of bal ‘rather’. Say ‘Are those who know equal with those who do not know?’ in other words they are not equal just as the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith possessors of intellect remember only they are admonished."
