For those who are virtuous in this world through obedience there will be good and that is Paradise and God’s earth is vast so emigrate throughout it away from the company of disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the steadfast in their obedience of God and in enduring whatever hardship they may be tested with will be paid their reward in full without any reckoning’ without any measure or any scales to work it out."
