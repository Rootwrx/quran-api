And the entire earth jamī‘an is a circumstantial qualifier in other words the seven earths will be in His grasp in other words it shall be grasped by Him meaning that it will be in His possession and at His disposal on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens will be rolled up brought together in His Right Hand by His power. Glory be to Him! And exalted be He above what they associate! with Him of partners."
