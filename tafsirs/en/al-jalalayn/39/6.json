  "text": "He created you from a single soul namely Adam then made from it its mate Eve; and He sent down for you of the cattle of camels cows small cattle sheep and goats eight kinds of each kind a male and a female — as He makes clear in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6143f.. He creates you in your mothers’ wombs creation after creation that is to say as a sperm-drop then a blood clot then a foetus in a threefold darkness that is the darkness of the belly that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is God your Lord. To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being turned away? from worshipping Him to worshipping things other than Him?"
