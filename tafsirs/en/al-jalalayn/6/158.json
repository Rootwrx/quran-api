On the day that one of your Lord’s signs comes — and this is the rising of the sun from the west as reported in the hadīth of the two Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — it shall not benefit a soul to believe if it had not believed theretofore lam takun āmanat min qabl is an adjectival qualification of nafs ‘a soul’ or a soul which had not until then earned in its belief some good some act of obedience that is to say its repentance shall be of no benefit to it as stated in the hadīth corpus. Say ‘Wait for one of these things We too are waiting’ for it."
