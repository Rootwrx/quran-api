  "text": "But his people disputed with him they argued with him about his religion and threatened him that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them. He said ‘Do you dispute with me read a-tuhājjūnnī or a-tuhājūnī where one of the two letters nūn is omitted the nūn which grammarians refer to as nūn al-raf‘ ‘the nūn of modal independence’ and which the Qur’ānic reciters refer to as nūn al-wiqāya ‘the nūn of preservation’; do you argue with me concerning the Oneness of God when He exalted be He has guided me to it? I have no fear of what you associate with Him in the way of idols that they might strike me with some evil since they have no power to do anything unless my Lord wills something harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember this and believe?"
