But whoever is constrained to do any of what has been mentioned and he consumes it neither coveting nor transgressing then surely your Lord is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful’ towards him. To these prohibited things the Sunna adds all beasts of prey with canine teeth and birds of prey with talons."
