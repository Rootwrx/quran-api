  "text": "Eight pairs types thamāniyata azwājin substitutes for hamūlatan wa-farshan ‘some for burdens and some for light support’ two of sheep a male and a female; and of goats read ma‘az or ma‘z two. Say O Muhammad (s) to those who on one occasion deem male cattle forbidden and on another the females thereof and then ascribe such rules to God ‘Is it the two males of the sheep and goats He has forbidden you or the two females of these two types or that which the wombs of the two females contain be they male or female? Inform Me with knowledge of the details of such prohibitions if you speak truly’ in this matter meaning on what basis has the prohibition been made? If it is on the basis of maleness then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness then all females are so forbidden; if on what the womb may contain then both genders are prohibited. So on what basis are such specifications made? the interrogative is meant as a repudiation."
