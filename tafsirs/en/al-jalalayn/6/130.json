  "text": "‘O assembly of jinn and mankind did not messengers come to you from among you that is from among both of your number — which holds true in the case of mankind since messengers came from among them or by ‘messengers’ if the jinn are meant those messengers among the jinn who are their warners the ones who listen to the speech of the human messengers and convey it to their kind — to recount to you My signs and to warn you of the encounter of this Day of yours?’ They shall say ‘We bear witness against ourselves’ that all this was conveyed to us. God exalted be He says And the life of this world deluded them and so they did not believe. And they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers."
