And give full measure and full weight in justice fairly desisting from any fraud. We do not charge any soul beyond its capacity what it can bear in such matters so that if one makes a mistake in a measure or weight and God knows that his intention had been well-meaning then he suffers no blame as is stated in one hadīth. And if you speak to pass a judgement or otherwise then be just by being truthful even if he the person receiving the statement or the one being accused in it should be a kinsman. And fulfil God’s covenant. This is what He has charged you with that perhaps you will remember read tadhakkarūn or tadhkurūn you will be admonished."
