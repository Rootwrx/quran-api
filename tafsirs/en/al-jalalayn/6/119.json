  "text": "What is wrong with you that you do not eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked of sacrifices when He has detailed for both verbs read the passive fussila ‘it has been detailed’ and hurrima ‘that which has been forbidden’ or the active fassala ‘He has detailed’ and harrama ‘what He has forbidden’ for you what He has forbidden in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53 except that to which you are compelled? thereof which is also lawful for you. The meaning is there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption and that over which God’s Name has been invoked is not among these forbidden things. But truly many are led astray read la-yadillūna ‘many are led astray’ or la-yudillūna ‘many lead others astray’ by their whims by what their own selves fancy in the way of permitting the consumption of carrion and otherwise without any knowledge with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors those who overstep the bounds of what is lawful into what is unlawful."
