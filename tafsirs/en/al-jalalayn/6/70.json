  "text": "And forsake leave alone those who take their religion with which they have been charged as a game and a diversion making a mockery of it and whom the life of this world has deluded and so do not interfere with them — this was revealed before the command to fight them. Remind admonish people thereby by the Qur’ān lest a soul perish lest it be given up for destruction for what it has earned what it has done; it has no protector no helper besides God other than Him and no intercessor to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation though it pay every ransom it shall not be accepted from it that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved that is for their unbelief."
