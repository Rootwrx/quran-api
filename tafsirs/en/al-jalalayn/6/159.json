  "text": "Those who have sundered their religion by being at variance over it accepting some aspects of it and rejecting others and have become differing parties sects with regard to such matters a variant reading for farraqū ‘they have sundered’ has fāraqū meaning that they have abandoned the religion to which they were enjoined and they are the Jews and the Christians you have no concern with them at all in other words do not be concerned with them. Their case will go to God — He will take charge of it — then He will inform them in the Hereafter of what they used to do and requite them for it this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95."
