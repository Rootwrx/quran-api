He has prescribed He has decreed for Himself mercy as a bounty from Him — this is a gentle summoning of them to the faith. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt no uncertainty in order to requite you for your deeds. Those who have forfeited their own souls this is the subject — by exposing them to the chastisement — they do not believe this is the predicate."
