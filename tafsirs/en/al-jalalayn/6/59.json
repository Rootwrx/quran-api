  "text": "And with Him exalted be He are the keys of the Unseen its treasure houses or the paths that lead to knowledge of it; none but He knows them and these are the five things mentioned in His saying Surely God He has knowledge of the Hour and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it has earned for the morrow; nor does any soul know in what land it will die. Truly God is Knowing Aware Q. 3134 as reported by al-Bukhārī. He knows what is happening on land in the deserts and in the waters in the towns along the rivers; and not a leaf min waraqatin min is extra falls but He knows it. Not a grain in the shadows of the earth nothing of wet or dry this entire clause wa-lā habbatin fī zulumāti l-ardi wa-lā ratbin wa-lā yābisin is a supplement to waraqatin ‘a leaf’ but it is in a clear book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. The exceptive clause illā fī kitābin mubīn ‘but it is in a clear book’ constitutes an inclusive substitution for the previous exceptive clause illā ya‘lamuhā ‘but He knows it’."
