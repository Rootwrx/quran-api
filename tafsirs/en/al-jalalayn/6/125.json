  "text": "Whomever God desires to guide He expands his breast to Islam by casting into his heart a light which it the heart expands for and accepts as reported in a hadīth; and whomever He God desires to send astray He makes his breast narrow read dayqan or dayyiqan unable to accept it and constricted extremely tight read harijan ‘constricted’ as an adjective or harajan as a verbal noun by which it the heart of the misguided one is described hyperbolically as if he were engaged in ascent yassa‘‘ad is also read as yassā‘ad in both forms the original tā’ has been assimilated with the sād; a third variant reading has yas‘ad to the heaven when he is charged with the obligations of the faith because of the hardship for him therein. So like this making of the breast narrow God casts ignominy chastisement or He casts Satan that is He gives him authority over those who do not believe."
