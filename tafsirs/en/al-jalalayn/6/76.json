  "text": "When night descended when it darkened upon him he saw a star — said to have been Venus — and said to his people who were astrologers ‘This is my Lord’ as you are wont to claim. But when it set when it disappeared he said ‘I love not those that set’ to take them as lords because it is not possible for a true Lord to be transformed or to change place as such attributes pertain to accidents — but this had no effect on them."
