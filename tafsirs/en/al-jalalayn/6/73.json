And mention the day He says to a thing ‘Be’ and it is — this is the Day of Resurrection when He says to creatures ‘Rise up’ and they do. His words are the truth the truth that will doubtless come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet the horn is blown the second blast by the angel Isrāfīl when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him ‘Whose is the Kingdom today? God’s’ Q. 4016. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what may be seen. He is the Wise in His creation the Aware of things inwardly hidden and outwardly manifest."
