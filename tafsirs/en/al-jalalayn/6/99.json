Look O you addressed in reflection upon their fruits read thamarihi or thumurihi the plural of thamara like shajara ‘tree’ as plural of shajar and khashaba ‘a piece of wood’ for khashab when they have borne fruit when this first begins how it looks and look upon their ripening after they have reached full growth and the state to which they return. Surely in all that are signs proofs of His power exalted be He to resurrect and to do all other things for a people who believe it is these people that are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to profit from those signs by their believing in them in contrast to the disbelievers."
