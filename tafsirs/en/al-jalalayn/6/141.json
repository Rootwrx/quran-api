Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens before its maturity passes and pay the due thereof the alms as appropriate on the day of its harvest read yawma hasādahu or yawma hasādihi that is one tenth or half of it and do not be prodigal by giving it all away so that nothing remains for the consumption of your dependants. Truly God does not love the prodigal who overstep the bounds of that which He has delimited for them."
