  "text": "They say ‘These cattle and tillage are sacrosanct forbidden. No one is to eat of them except whom we will’ from among the retainers of the graven images and others — so they assert in other words they have no convincing argument for it — ‘and cattle whose backs have been forbidden and cannot therefore be ridden such as the camels they call Sā’ibas or Hāmīs and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God’ when they slaughter them invoking instead the names of their idols ascribing such rules to God; forging lies against Him. He will assuredly requite them for what they used to fabricate against Him."
