  "text": "Messengers indeed have been denied before you — herein is a consolation for the Prophet s — yet they endured patiently the denial and the persecution until Our victorious help came to them through the destruction of their peoples so be patient until the victorious help comes to you through the destruction of your people. There is none to change the words of God His promises and there has already come to you tidings of the messengers tidings through which your heart can be at peace."
