Or were you witnesses present when God charged you with this? prohibition such that you use it to support your claims? Nay! You speak lies in this matter. Then who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God in this matter that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk’."
