  "text": "And mention the day when He God shall gather them yahshuruhum may also read nahshuruhum ‘We shall gather them’ that is creatures all together and it will be said to them ‘O assembly of jinn you have garnered much of mankind’ by your misleading them. Then their friends those who obeyed them from among mankind will say ‘Our Lord we enjoyed one another mankind enjoyed what the jinn adorned for them of passions while the jinn enjoyed mankind’s obedience to them; but now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us’ that is the Day of Resurrection — this statement expresses extreme regret on their part. He exalted be He will say to them by the tongues of the angels ‘The Fire is your lodging your abode to abide therein’ — except what God wills of those times when they will exit from it in order to drink boiling water which is located outside it as God exalted be He has said Then they shall return to the Hell-fire Q. 3768; according to Ibn ‘Abbās this proviso pertains to those whom God knows will believe mā ‘what’ thus has the sense of man ‘whom’. Surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures."
