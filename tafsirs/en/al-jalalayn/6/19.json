  "text": "When they said to the Prophet s ‘Bring us someone to testify to the truth of your prophethood for the People of the Scripture have denied you’ the following was revealed Say to them ‘What thing is greatest in testimony?’ shahādatan this is for specification and is derived from the implied subject of the sentence. Say ‘God — even if they do not say this there is no other response — He is Witness between me and you to my truthfulness; and this Qur’ān has been revealed to me that I may warn you that I may make you fear O people of Mecca thereby and whomever it may reach wa-man balagha this is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun ‘you’ of undhira-kum ‘I may warn you’ that is to say whomever among men and jinn the Qur’ān may reach. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods with God?’ this interrogative is meant as a disavowal. Say to them ‘I do not bear witness’ to this. Say ‘He is only One God and I am innocent of what you associate’ with Him of idols."
