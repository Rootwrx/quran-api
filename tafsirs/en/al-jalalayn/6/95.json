  "text": "God it is Who splits the grain from the plants and the date-stone from the palm-trees. He brings forth the living from the dead such as the human being from the sperm and the bird from the egg; and is the Bringer-forth of the dead the sperm and the egg from the living. That Splitter and Bringer-forth is God. How then are you deluded? so how then are you turned away from faith despite the proof being established?"
