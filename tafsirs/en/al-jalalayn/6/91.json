You put it in all three instances the verbs may be read either in the third person plural yaj‘alūnahu ‘they put it’; yubdūnahā ‘they reveal it’; wa-yukhfūna ‘and they hide’ or in the second person plural taj‘alūnahu ‘you put it’; tubdūnahā ‘you reveal it’; wa-tukhfūna ‘and you hide’ on parchments that is you write it down on fragments of notes which you disclose that is what you choose to disclose thereof but you hide much of what is in them as in the case of the descriptions of Muhammad (s); and you have been taught O Jews in the Qur’ān what you did not know neither you nor your fathers’ in the Torah through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in disagreement over. Say ‘God’ revealed it — and if they do not say it there is no other response — then leave them to play in their discourse their falsehood."
