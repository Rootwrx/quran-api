  "text": "It is He Who takes you at night seizing your spirits during sleep and He knows what you commit what you earn by day. Then He raises you up therein that is in the daytime by restoring your spirits so that an appointed term namely the term of life may be accomplished; and afterward to Him is your return through resurrection. Then He will inform you of what you used to do and so requite you for it."
