  "text": "Praise which means to describe in beautiful terms be ever established to God is this meant to be informative so that one believes in it? Or is it meant as a eulogy or both? These are three possibilities the most likely of which is the last as the Shaykh Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī states in his commentary on sūrat al-Kahf Q. 181; Who created the heavens and the earth — He singles out these two for mention because for the observer they constitute the most awesome visible creation; and He appointed He created darknesses and light that is every darkness zulma and every light the use of the plural only in the case of the former is because it darkness has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His Oneness; then those who disbelieve despite the existence of this proof ascribe equals to their Lord they worship others equally."
