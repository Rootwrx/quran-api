  "text": "The idolaters will say ‘Had God willed we would not have been idolaters neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything’ in other words our idolatry and our forbidding of things are by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God exalted be He says So in the same way that these have lied those who were before them gave the lie to their prophets until they tasted Our might Our chastisement. Say ‘Have you any knowledge that God is satisfied with this such that you can adduce for us? that is you have no such knowledge. You follow only supposition in this matter merely guessing’ telling lies therein."
