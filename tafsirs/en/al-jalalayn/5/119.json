  "text": "God says ‘This namely the Day of Resurrection is the day those who were truthful in the world like Jesus shall profit by their truthfulness because this is the Day of Requital. Theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they shall abide forever. God is well-pleased with them because of their obedience to Him and they are well-pleased with Him with His reward — that is the great triumph’. The sincerity of those who were liars in this world shall not avail them on that Day just as it shall not avail the disbelievers when they believe upon seeing the chastisement."
