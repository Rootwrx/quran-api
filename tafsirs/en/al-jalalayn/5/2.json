  "text": "O you who believe do not profane God’s sacraments sha‘ā’ir is the plural of sha‘īra that is the ritual ceremonies of the religion by hunting game while you are on pilgrimage nor the sacred month by fighting in it nor the offering that is the boon offered in the Meccan Sanctuary by interfering with it nor the garlands qalā’id is the plural of qilāda and these made from the trees around the Sanctuary were placed around it the offering to protect it in other words do not interfere with these offerings or with those who place them; nor violate the sanctity of those repairing those heading to the Sacred House by fighting them who are seeking bounty provision from their Lord through commerce and His beatitude by resorting to Him as they the Meccans pagans falsely claimed this was abrogated by the barā’a verse of sūrat al-Tawba Q. 94. But when you are discharged from pilgrimage inviolability then hunt for game a command denoting permission. And let not hatred read shana’ānu or shan’ānu of a people that because they barred you from the Sacred Mosque cause you to commit aggression against them by killing them or otherwise. Help one another to righteousness by doing that to which you were enjoined and piety by refraining from what you have been forbidden; do not help one another ta‘āwanū one of the two original tā’ letters in tata‘āwanū has been omitted to sin acts of disobedience and enmity transgression of God’s bounds. And fear God fear His punishment by being obedient to Him; surely God is severe in retribution against those that oppose Him."
