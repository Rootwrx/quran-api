Although this stipulation was prescribed for them it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it that is retaliation out of charity able to restrain himself then that shall be an expiation for him of what he has done of other sins. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed in the matter of retaliation and otherwise those are the evildoers."
