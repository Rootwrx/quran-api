Lawful to you is the beast of the flocks camels cattle and sheep and goats to eat after slaughtering them except that which is now being recited to you as forbidden in the verse below Forbidden to you are carrion…Q. 53; the exceptive clause here is a discontinuous one but may also be continuous; the forbidding concerns that which has succumbed to death and the like; game not being lawful to you when you are on pilgrimage hurum means muhrimūn; ghayra ‘not’ is in the accusative as it introduces a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the pronoun lakum ‘to you’. Verily God decrees whatever He desires in the way of making things lawful or otherwise and there can be no objection thereto."
