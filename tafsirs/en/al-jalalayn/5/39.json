  "text": "But whoever repents after his evildoing refrains from theft and amends his actions God will relent to him. God is indeed Forgiving Merciful in expressing what has been stated. However the rights of the victim to have the penalty of amputation carried out and his property restored are not automatically forgone after repentance. In fact as is clarified in the Sunna only if he is pardoned before being taken to the Imam is the punishment of amputation waived and al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion."
