  "text": "Mention when God said ‘O Jesus son of Mary remember My favour to you and to your mother be thankful for it; when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit Gabriel to speak to people tukallimu’l-nāsa is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun kāf in ayyadtu-ka in the cradle that is as a child and in maturity — this implies that he will descend before the Hour since he was raised up to God before middle age as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 355 and when I taught you the Scripture and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how you create out of clay the likeness ka-hay’at the kāf here functions like a noun and is a direct object the image of a bird by My permission and you breathe into it and it becomes a bird by My permission by My will and you heal the blind and the leper by My permission and you raise the dead from their graves back to life by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you when they intended to kill you when you brought them clear proofs miracles and the disbelievers among them said “This what you have done is nothing but manifest sorcery” a variant reading for sihrun ‘sorcery’ has sāhirun ‘sorcerer’ in other words he Jesus is nothing but a manifest sorcerer."
