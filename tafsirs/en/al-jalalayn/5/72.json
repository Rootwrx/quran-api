  "text": "They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘Indeed God is the Messiah son of Mary’ a similar verse has preceded Q. 517. For the Messiah said to them ‘O Children of Israel worship God my Lord and your Lord for I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God in worship for him God has made Paradise forbidden He has forbidden him admittance to it and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers wa-mā li’l-zālimīna min the min is extra there shall be no helpers’ to guard them against the chastisement of God."
