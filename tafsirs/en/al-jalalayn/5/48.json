  "text": "And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ confirming the Book that was before it and watching over it testifying to it — the ‘Book’ means the Scriptures. So judge between them between the People of the Scripture if they take their cases before you according to what God has revealed to you and do not follow their whims deviating away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you O communities We have appointed a divine law and a way a clear path in religion for them to proceed along. If God had willed He would have made you one community following one Law but He separated you one from the other that He may try you in what He has given to you of the differing Laws in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return through resurrection and He will then inform you of that in which you differed in the matter of religion and requite each of you according to his deeds."
