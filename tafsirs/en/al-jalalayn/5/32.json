  "text": "Because of that which Cain did We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul slain or for other than corruption committed in the land in the way of unbelief fornication or waylaying and the like it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one by refraining from slaying it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abbās said that the above is meant in the sense of violating and protecting its a soul’s sanctity respectively. Our messengers have already come to them that is to the Children of Israel with clear proofs miracles but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land overstepping the bounds through disbelief killing and the like."
