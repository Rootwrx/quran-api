  "text": "God has not ordained He has not stipulated in His Law anything such as a Bahīra a Sā’iba a Wasīla or a Hām in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukhārī reported in a hadīth from Sa‘īd b. al-Musayyab who said ‘The bahīra is that camel whose milk is consecrated to idols and whom no human may milk; the sā’iba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was forbidden to bear any load; the wasīla is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female as its first offspring followed by another female bearing one after the other without a male in between she would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the hām is the mature male camel which after completing a certain number of copulations with a female would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt from bearing any load and they would call it hāmī; but the disbelievers invent lies against God in this matter by attributing the sanctioning of such practices to Him; and most of them do not understand that this is mendacity for in this they have merely followed the example of their forefathers."
