  "text": "The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him and so he passed away like them for he is not a god as they claim otherwise he would not have passed away; his mother was a truthful woman siddÄ«qa means extremely truthful; they both used to eat food like all other human beings and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible nature and because of the impurities such as urine and excrement that he produces. Behold in amazement how We make the signs of Our Oneness clear to them then behold how they are turned away! how they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established."
