Likewise the believing free married women and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you are permitted to you for marriage if you give them their wages their dowries in wedlock in marriage and not illicitly fornicating overtly with them or taking them as lovers so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith that is whose apostatises his prior good work has indeed failed and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers if he dies in this state of unbelief."
