  "text": "There said to them two men of those who feared contravening God’s command and these were Joshua and Caleb — who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of those giants — to whom God had been gracious by making them virtuous for they concealed what they had discovered about the giants telling only Moses unlike the other leaders who divulged the news and so the people became cowardly. ‘Enter against them by the gate! the gate of the town and have no fear of them for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it you will be victorious the two Joshua and Caleb said this because they were certain of God’s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put your trust in God if you are believers’."
