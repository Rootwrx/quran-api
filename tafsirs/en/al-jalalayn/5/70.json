  "text": "And We made a covenant with the Children of Israel to believe in God and His messengers and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them from among them with what their souls did not desire in the way of truth they denied it; some of them they denied and some of them they slay such as Zachariah and John the use of the present tense yaqtulūn ‘they slay’ instead of the perfect tense qatalū is to narrate past events as if in the present and to conclude in harmony with the end-rhyme of the verses."
