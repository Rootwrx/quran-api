  "text": "O Messenger let them not grieve you the actions of those who vie with one another in disbelief falling headlong into it in other words they who manifest it at every opportunity of min here is explicative such as say with their mouths with their tongues bi-alsinatihim is semantically connected to qālū ‘such as say’ ‘We believe’ but their hearts do not believe and these are the hypocrites; and from among those of Jewry there is a folk who listen to calumny fabricated by their rabbis listening acceptingly listening to you on behalf of some other folk from among the Jews who have not come to you these were the inhabitants of Khaybar among whom two married persons committed adultery but whom they did not want to stone. And so they dispatched men from Qurayza to ask the Prophet s about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words that are in the Torah such as the ‘stoning’ verse from their contexts the contexts in which God had placed them that is to say substituting them saying to the ones they dispatched ‘If you are given this distorted ruling that is flogging which Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling then take it accept it; but if you are not given it and he pronounces some other ruling for you then beware!’ of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try to lead astray you cannot avail him anything against God by preventing such a trial. Those are they whose hearts God did not desire to purify of unbelief for had He desired it you would have been able to do something for them; theirs shall be degradation in this world humiliation by being disgraced and subjected to the jizya and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement."
