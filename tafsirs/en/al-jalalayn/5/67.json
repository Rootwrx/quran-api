  "text": "O Messenger make known all of that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not conceal any of it out of fear that you may suffer some harm; for if you do not that is if you do not make known all of what has been revealed to you you will not have conveyed His Message risālatahu or read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ since to conceal some of it is to conceal it all. God will protect you from people who may try to kill you. The Prophet s used to have guards up until the time that this verse was revealed then he said ‘Depart for God protects me now’ as reported by al-Hākim. God does not guide the unbelieving folk."
