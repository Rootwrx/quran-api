It is not mine it is unjustified for me to say what I have no right to bi-haqq ‘right to’ is the predicate of laysa ‘not’; lī ‘mine’ is explicative. If I indeed had said it You would have known it. You know what is hidden by me in my self but I do not know what is within Your Self that is what You keep hidden of Your knowledge You are the Knower of things unseen."
