  "text": "God said granting his supplication ‘Verily I shall send it down read munziluhā or munazziluhā to you; but whoever of you disbelieves afterward after it has been sent down I shall surely chastise him with a chastisement wherewith I chastise no other being from among all the worlds’ and so the angels descended with it from heaven on it were seven loaves and seven large fish and so they ate of it until they were full as related by Ibn ‘Abbās. In one hadīth it is said that the Table sent down from heaven consisted of bread and meat and they were commanded not to be treacherous and nor to store anything for the next day but they were and they stored some of it and were consequently transformed into apes and swine."
