  "text": "The following was revealed when they began to ask the Prophet s too many questions O you who believe do not ask about things which if disclosed to you if revealed would trouble you because of the hardship that would ensue from them; yet if you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed during the time of the Prophet s they will be disclosed to you meaning that if you ask about certain things during his lifetime the Qur’ān will reveal them but once these things are disclosed it will grieve you. So do not ask about them; indeed God has pardoned those things you asked about so do not ask again; for God is Forgiving Forbearing."
