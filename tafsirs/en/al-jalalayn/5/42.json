If they come to you to judge between them then judge between them or turn away from them the second option given here was abrogated by His saying So judge between them to the end of the verse Q. 548. Therefore we Muslims are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us — and this is the more sound of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim however then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus of legal scholars and not just al-Shāfi‘ī; if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge between them then judge justly between them; God loves the just those that judge fairly meaning that He will reward them."
