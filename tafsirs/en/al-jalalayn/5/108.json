  "text": "That ruling mentioned where the oath devolves to the inheritors makes it likelier brings closer the eventuality that they the witnesses or the trustees will bear the testimony in its true form the form in which they have been charged to bear it without distortion or breach of faith or it is likelier that they will be afraid that after their oaths other oaths may be taken from the inheritors the plaintiffs who would swear to the two menâ€™s breach of faith or perjury in which case they would be disgraced and would incur penalties and so because of this they will not lie. Fear God by refraining from betrayal and perjury and listen to what you have been commanded listening in acceptance. God does not guide the wicked people those rebelling against obedience to Him; He does not guide the wicked to the way of goodness."
