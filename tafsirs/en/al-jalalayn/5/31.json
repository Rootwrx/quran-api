  "text": "Then God sent forth a raven scratching into the earth digging up the soil with its beak and with its legs and throwing it up over a dead raven next to it until it completely hid it to show him how he might hide the nakedness the carcass of his brother. He said ‘Woe to me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother’s nakedness?’ And he became one of the remorseful for having carried him; he then dug a hole for him and covered him up."
