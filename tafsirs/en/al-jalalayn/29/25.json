  "text": "And he Abraham said ‘You have adopted mere idols besides God which you worship mā of innamā relates to the verbal noun for the sake of mutual affection between you mawaddatu baynikum this is the predicate of inna of innamā; the accusative reading mawaddata baynikum would denote a direct object denoting reason so that the mā would denote ‘entirety’ — in other words you are friends of one another in your worship of them in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another the leaders will dissociate from those who followed them; and you will curse one another those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode your destination all together will be the Fire and you will have no helpers’ to protect you against it."
