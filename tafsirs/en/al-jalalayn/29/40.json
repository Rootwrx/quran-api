  "text": "So each of those mentioned We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones as in the case of the people of Lot and among them were some who were seized by the Cry such as ThamÅ«d and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow such as Korah and among them were some whom We drowned like the people of Noah Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them by chastising them for having committed no sin but they wronged themselves by committing sins."
