And so those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others believe in it in the Qur’ān and of these people of Mecca there are some who believe in it; and none denies Our signs after they have been manifested except disbelievers namely the Jews and those for whom it was apparent that the Qur’ān was the truth and that the one who brought it was truthful but still denied it."
