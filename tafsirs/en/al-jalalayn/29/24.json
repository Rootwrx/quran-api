Surely in that namely in that deliverance of him from it there are signs — namely the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place — for a people who believe a people who affirm the truth of God’s Oneness and His power for they are the ones to benefit from these signs."
