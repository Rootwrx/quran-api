Do you come unto men and cut off the way the travel roads of passers-by committing lewd acts with whoever passes your way such that people ceased to pass by where you live and you discuss in your gatherings in your conversations indecency?’ you discuss committing lewd acts with one another. But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Bring us the chastisement of God if you are truthful’ in your deeming such acts vile and that chastisement will befall those who do such things."
