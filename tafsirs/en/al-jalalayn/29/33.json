  "text": "And when Our messengers came to Lot he was distressed on their account he was grieved because of them and he was constrained unable to help them because they had handsome faces dressed as guests and thus he feared for them from his people. So they informed him that they were the messengers of his Lord. But they said ‘Do not be afraid nor grieve. We shall surely deliver you read munajjūka or munjūka and your family except your wife she is of those who will remain behind ahlaka ‘your family’ is in the accusative as a supplement to the suffixed direct object pronoun kāf of munajjūka ‘We shall surely deliver you’."
