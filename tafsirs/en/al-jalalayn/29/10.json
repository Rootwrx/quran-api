  "text": "And among people there are those who say ‘We believe in God’ but if such a person suffers hurt in God’s cause he takes people’s persecution that is their harming of him to be the same as God’s chastisement in terms of his fear of it and so he obeys them and behaves hypocritically. Yet if la-in the lām is for oaths there comes help to believers from your Lord and they take spoils they will assuredly say la-yaqūlunna the final nūn of the indicative has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw indicating the plural person has been replaced by a damma because of two unvocalised consonants coming together ‘We were indeed with you’ in faith so give us a share of the booty. God exalted be He says Does God not know best what is in the breasts of all creatures? what is in their hearts of faith or hypocrisy? Indeed He does."
