  "text": "The day when the hypocrites men and women will say to those who believe ‘Look at us unzurūnā a variant reading has anzirūnā meaning ‘Give us a chance’ that we may glean something of your light!’ It will be said to them in mockery of them ‘Step back and seek light!’ So they step back then there will be set up between them and the believers a wall — this is said to be the wall of ‘the Heights’ cf. Q. 746 — with a gate the inner side of which contains mercy the side of the believers and the outer side of which the side of the hypocrites faces toward the chastisement."
