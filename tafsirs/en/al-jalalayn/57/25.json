And We sent down iron We caused it to be extracted from mineral ores wherein is great might with which one may wage battle and many uses for mankind and so that God may know a knowledge of direct vision li-ya‘lama’Llāhu is a supplement to li-yaqūma’l-nāsu ‘so that mankind may uphold’ those who help Him by helping to uphold His religion through the use of instruments of war made of metal and otherwise and His messengers through the Unseen bi’l-ghaybi a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ ‘Him’ of yansuruhu ‘who aid Him’ that is to say while He God is not seen by them in this world. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They help Him even though they do not see Him’ yansurūnahu wa-lā yubsirūnahu. Assuredly God is Strong Mighty without any need of being helped but such help benefits those who proffer it."
