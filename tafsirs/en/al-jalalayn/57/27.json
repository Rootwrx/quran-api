  "text": "Then We sent to follow in their footsteps Our messengers and We sent to follow Jesus son of Mary and We gave him the Gospel and We placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy. But as for monasticism namely abstention from women and seclusion in monasteries they invented it an innovation on their part — We had not prescribed it for them We did not enjoin them to it; but they took it on — only seeking God’s beatitude. Yet they did not observe it with due observance for many of them abandoned it and rejected the religion of Jesus and embraced the religion of their then king. However many of them did remain upon the religion of Jesus and they believed in our Prophet when he came. So We gave those of them who believed in him their reward; but many of them are immoral."
