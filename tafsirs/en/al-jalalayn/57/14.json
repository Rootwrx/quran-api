But you caused your souls to fall into temptation by engaging in hypocrisy and you awaited reversals of fortune for the believers and you doubted you were uncertain about the religion of Islam and false hopes greedy desires deceived you until God’s ordinance death came; and the Deceiver Satan deceived you concerning God."
