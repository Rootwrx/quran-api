He knows what enters the earth of rain and dead creatures and what issues from it of vegetation and minerals and what comes down from the heaven in the way of mercy and chastisement and what ascends in it of righteous deeds and evil ones. And He is with you by virtue of His knowledge wherever you may be; and God is Seer of what you do."
