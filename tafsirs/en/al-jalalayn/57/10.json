  "text": "And why should you after having embraced faith not allā the nūn of an an-lā has been assimilated here with the lām of lā expend in the way of God when to God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth with all that they comprise so that He will eventually receive all your wealth but without the reward for having expended of it for His cause as opposed to if you had expended and had hence been rewarded. Not equal to the rest of you are those of you who expended and fought before the victory at Mecca. Such are greater in rank than those who expended and fought afterwards. Yet to each of the two groups a variant reading for wa-kullan ‘yet to each’ has nominative wa-kullun as a subject God has promised the best reward Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly."
