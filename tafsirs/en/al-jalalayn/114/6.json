  "text": "of the jinn and mankind’ mina’l-jinnati wa’l-nāsi an explication for the whispering Satan being of the jinn and also of the humans similar to God’s saying the devils of humans and jinn Q. 6112; or mina’l-jinnati ‘of the jinn’ is an explication for him Satan wa’l-nāsi ‘and of mankind’ being a supplement to al-waswās ‘the whisperer’. Both explanations apply to the evil of the mentioned Labīd and his daughters; the objection to the first opinion is that humans do not ‘whisper’ in the hearts of other humans but that it is the jinn who whisper in their hearts I would respond by saying that human beings also ‘whisper’ in a manner appropriate to them beginning externally whereafter their whispers reach the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this customarily happens. But God knows best what is correct and to Him shall be the return and the final destination and may God bless our Master Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them all much peace forever and always. God suffices for us and what an excellent guardian is He! And there is no power or might except in God the Sublime the Tremendous."
