  "text": "in an abode of truth a place of truth wherein there is no idle talk or cause for sin — the collective noun maq‘ad is meant here; a variant reading has maqā‘id ‘abodes’ in other words they are in congregations in Paradise that are free from idle talk and cause for sin in contrast to the congregations of this world which are rarely free from such things syntactically this statement is considered a second predicate and also a substitution; it the ‘abode’ may be understood as being ‘one of truth’ regardless of whether one reads the substitution as being of the part for the whole or otherwise; before a King malīk this form is hyperbolic that is to say One of a mighty and vast kingdom Who is Omnipotent Powerful Whom nothing can thwart namely God exalted be He ‘inda indicates glorious rank and closeness to His bounty exalted be He."
