So We blotted out their eyes We blinded them and made them without slits so that they were continuous folds of skin like the rest of the face by having Gabriel smack them with his wing. ‘So taste now so We said to them taste My chastisement and My warnings’ that is to say taste the effects and the substance of My warning and My threat."
