So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot still there? There are two opinions regarding this in the case of the former that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot the exception is understood as a continuous one while in the case of the latter opinion that they were delivered before the squall the exception is understood as a discontinuous one even if it ‘the family of Lot’ is actually subsumed by the collective noun ‘the people of Lot’ and so they were delivered as a kindness from God;"
