The Prophet s after this sūra had been revealed would frequently repeat the words subhāna’Llāhi wa bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’ and astaghfiru’Llāha wa-atūbu ilayhi ‘I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him’; with the revelation of this final sūra he realised that his end was near. The victory over Mecca was in Ramadān of year 8; the Prophet s passed away in Rabī‘ I of the year 10."
