  "text": "And when Our signs in the Qur’ān are recited to them though they are clear manifest signs bayyinātin a circumstantial qualifier you perceive on the faces of those who disbelieve denial that is to say denial of these signs in other words you perceive the effect of such denial in the way of aversion and frowning. They would almost pounce upon those who recite Our signs to them that is they would almost fall upon them in assault. Say ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that? something more repulsive to you than the Qur’ān that is being recited to you? It is The Fire! God has promised it to the disbelievers in that their journey’s end shall be to it. And it is an evil journey’s end!’"
