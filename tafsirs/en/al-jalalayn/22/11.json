  "text": "And among mankind there are those who worship God on a knife-edge that is with uncertainty in his worship — such a person has been likened the knife- edge of a mountain in his precariousness — if good fortune befalls him so that he enjoys health and security with respect to his own self and his property he is reassured by it; but if an ordeal befalls him a trial or ill-health with regard to himself or his property he makes a turnabout that is he reverts to disbelief losing both this world when what he had hoped for in it has eluded him and the Hereafter by his disbelief. That is the manifest loss."
