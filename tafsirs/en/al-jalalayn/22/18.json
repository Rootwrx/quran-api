  "text": "Have you not seen have you not realised that to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth together with the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the animals that is how they are submissive to Him in what He wills of them as well as many of mankind? namely the believers who prostrate to Him in addition to their submissiveness to Him when prostrating in prayer. And for many the chastisement has become due and these are the disbelievers for they refuse to prostrate an action which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases he whom He makes unprosperous there is none to give him honour none to make him fortunate. Indeed God does whatever He will in the way of abasing or giving honour."
