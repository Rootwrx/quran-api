  "text": "That dhālika an implied subject al-amru ‘the matter is’ is taken to precede this predicate. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God then that in other words then that veneration of them — namely of the beasts of sacrifice offered in the Sanctuary after the best of them have been selected and fattened — derives from the piety of the hearts of those individuals. These sacraments are called sha‘ā’ir because they are marked out ish‘ār with something to indicate that they are offerings such as having a hump pierced with a piece of metal."
