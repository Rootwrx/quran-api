  "text": "Whoever supposes that God will not help him namely Muhammad (s) His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter let him extend a rope to the ceiling to the roof of his house fixing it there and tying it to his neck and let him hang himself that is let him choke to death because of it by severing his soul from any existence on the earth as reported in the various SahÄ«h compilations. Then let him see whether his strategy against the Prophet being helped dispels that which enrages him about it. In other words let him choke to death with rage because of it for it is inevitable."
