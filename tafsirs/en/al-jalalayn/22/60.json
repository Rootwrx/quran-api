And whoever retaliates whoever from among the believers requites with the like of what he was made to suffer at the hands of the idolaters wrongfully that is whoever fights against them if they fight against him during the sacred month and then is again made to suffer aggression by them that is to say he is again wronged by being expelled from his house God will surely help him. Indeed God is Pardoning to believers Forgiving them their engaging in combat during the sacred month."
