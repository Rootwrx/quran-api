Were it not for God’s causing some people ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for al-nāsa ‘people’ to drive back others destruction would have befallen read la-huddimat to emphasise a great number of destructions; or read la-hudimat the monasteries sawāmi‘ is for monks and churches kanā’is are for Christians and synagogues salawāt is the Hebrew term for Jewish houses of worship kanā’is and mosques masājid are for Muslims in which that is in which mentioned places God’s Name is mentioned greatly and with such destruction acts of worship cease.
