  "text": "And as for the sacrificial camels al-budn plural of badana which are ‘camels’ — We have appointed them for you as one of God’s sacraments the ritual ceremonies of His religion. There is good for you in them benefit for you in this world as already mentioned and a reward in the Hereafter. So mention God’s Name over them at the point of immolating them when they are lined up standing on three legs with the left foreleg hobbled. Then when their flanks have collapsed fallen to the ground after immolation — which is the time when one may eat of them — eat of them if you wish and feed the self-contained beggar al-qāni‘ a beggar who is content with what he is given neither asking nor approaching people and the suppliant al-mu‘tarr a beggar who asks for charity or approaches people for that purpose. So that is similar to such a disposal We have disposed them for you that it may be immolated or ridden — for otherwise it would not have been possible — that perhaps you might be thankful for My graces to you."
