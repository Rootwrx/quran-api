  "text": "Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God that is neither of these shall be raised up to Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him that is it is your righteous action performed purely for Him together with your faith that shall be raised up to Him. Thus has He disposed them for you that you may magnify God for His guiding you for His pointing out to you the ritual ceremonies of His religion and the rites of His pilgrimage. And give good tidings to the virtuous namely those who affirm the Oneness of God."
