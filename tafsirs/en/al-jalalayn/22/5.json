And We establish nuqirru marks a new grammatically independent sentence in the wombs whatever We will for a specified time that is until the time for it to come out then We bring you forth from the bellies of your mothers as infants and then We extend your life that you may come of age ashuddakum that is to say your prime and strength which is that age between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are taken away by death before coming of age and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life its most despicable state of decrepitude and senility so that after having had some knowledge he no longer knows anything — ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān such a state will not befall him’. And you see the earth torpid barren yet when We send down water upon it it stirs it moves and swells it rises and grows and grows plants of anbatat min min is extra every delightful fair kind species."
