  "text": "Praise be to God — God exalted be He praises Himself with these words; the import constitutes the eulogy that ‘praise’ is ever-established for God and it entails the attribution to Him of all that is beautiful exalted be He — to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth as possessions and creation. And to Him belongs all praise in the Hereafter as in this world for His friends praise Him as they enter Paradise. And He is the Wise in what He does the Aware of His creatures."
