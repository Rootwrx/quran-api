  "text": "Say ‘Who provides for you from the heavens rain and from the earth?’ vegetation. Say ‘God!’ — even if they do not say it there is no other valid answer. And indeed either we or you are — in other words either one of the two parties is — rightly guided or in manifest error. The ambiguity here concerning which of the two is rightly guided is intended as a gentle invitation for them to embrace faith if their way to it is facilitated by God."
