  "text": "And We said ‘Fashion from it long coats of mail — complete suits of armour which the person wearing it drags behind him along the ground — and measure well the links’ that is in the weaving of the coats the maker of these is called sarrād. In other words make them so that the rings thereof are arranged properly. And act O family of David together with him righteously. Indeed I am Seer of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly."
