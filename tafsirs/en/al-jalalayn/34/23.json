Yet when fear is banished from their hearts read active fazza‘a or passive fuzzi‘a when fear is removed from them upon leave being given for this intercession they will say — some will say to others in anticipation of a favourable outcome — ‘What has your Lord said?’ concerning this. They will say He has said the saying that is ‘The truth’ in other words leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted above His creation by His subjugation of them the Great the Tremendous."
