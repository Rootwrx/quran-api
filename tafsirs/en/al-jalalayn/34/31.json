God exalted be He says of them But if you were to see O Muhammad (s) when the evildoers the disbelievers are brought to stand before their Lord bandying arguments against one another. Those who were oppressed — the followers — will say to those who were arrogant — the leaders ‘Had it not been for you barring us from faith we would have been believers’ in the Prophet."
