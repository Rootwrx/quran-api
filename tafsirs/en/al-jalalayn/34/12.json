  "text": "And We disposed for Solomon the wind the nominative reading of al-rīhu would be based on an implicit missing verb sakhkharnā ‘We disposed’ its morning course meaning its journey from the morning to the noon was a month’s journey and its evening course that is its journey from the noon to sunset was a month’s journey. And We caused a fount of molten copper to flow for him in other words We caused the copper to melt for him and so the fount flowed for three days and nights like water and to this day people have been using of that copper which was given to Solomon at that time. And of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the leave by the command of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command to him to obey him Solomon We would make them taste the chastisement of the Blaze the Fire in the Hereafter — but it is also said that their chastisement was in this world in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that would scorch him."
