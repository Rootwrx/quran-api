So they followed him if the verb above is read sadaqa this would mean that ‘he was right in his opinion’ and if read saddaqa it would mean that ‘he found this opinion of his to be true’ — all except a group of the believers mina’l-mu’minīna the min ‘of’ is explicative not partitive in other words all except that group who were the believers they did not follow him."
