  "text": "When the Revelation did not come for a number of days the Prophet s said to Gabriel ‘What prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?’ and so the following was revealed And We do not descend except by the commandment of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us namely ahead of us of the affairs of the Hereafter and all that is behind us of the affairs of this world and all that is between those two namely all that takes place from this point in time until the coming of the Hour in other words to Him belongs knowledge of all of those things. And your Lord is never forgetful meaning that He is never neglectful of you even when the Revelation is postponed from being sent to you."
