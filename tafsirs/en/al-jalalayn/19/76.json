  "text": "And God increases in guidance those who found right guidance through faith increasing them by way of the signs He reveals to them; and the enduring things the righteous deeds — namely obedience the reward of which endures for that person — are better in your Lord’s sight in terms of reward and better in terms of the return that is as something which will be repaid and returned to him the believer in contrast to the deeds of the disbelievers. The use of the qualification khayr ‘better’ here is meant to counter the use of the same in their statement ‘Which of the two parties is better in station?’ above Q. 1973."
