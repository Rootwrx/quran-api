Your Lord says “It is easy for Me namely to restore your sexual potency and tear open your wife’s womb in preparation for conception for I certainly created you before when you were nothing”’ you were nothing before your created form became manifest. As God wished to manifest this great power He inspired him the form of the question in order for him to receive the response that will indicate it this power. And when his soul yearned for the prompt arrival of that whereof he had been given good tidings"
