  "text": "Those ūlā’ika is the subject to whom God has been gracious alladhīna an‘ama’Llāhu ‘alayhim is an adjectival qualification of it of the subject from among the prophets mina’l-nabīyyīna an explication of it of the subject functioning like an adjectival qualification in terms of import. That which follows it mina’l-nabīyyīna ‘from among the prophets’ up to where the conditional sentence begins constitutes an adjectival qualification of al-nabīyyīna ‘the prophets’; and so His saying …  of the seed of Adam namely Idrīs and of those whom We carried with Noah in the Ark namely Abraham — who is the son of his Noah’s son Shem Sām — and of the seed of Abraham namely Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and of the seed of Israel — who is Jacob — namely Moses Aaron Zachariah John and Jesus and from among those whom We guided and chose that is to say from among their number the predicate of ūlā’ika ‘those’ is the following idhā tutlā … when the signs of the Compassionate One were recited to them they would fall down prostrating and weeping these sujjadan and bukīyyan constitute the plural forms of sājid ‘prostrate’ and bākin ‘weeping’ respectively in other words what is meant is be you like them bukiyyun is originally formed from bakūyyin but the wāw is changed into a yā’ and the damma vowel into a kasra."
