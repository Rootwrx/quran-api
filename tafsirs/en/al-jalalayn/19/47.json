Truly He is ever gracious to me hafiyyan from hafiyyun meaning bārrun ‘kind’ answering my prayers. And indeed he Abraham fulfilled his above-mentioned promise as described in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ And forgive my father Q. 2686; but this was before it became clear to him that he Abraham’s father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114."
