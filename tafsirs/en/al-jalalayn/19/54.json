Indeed he was true to his promise â€” he never promised anything which he did not fulfil; he once waited for three days for someone whom he had promised to meet; or it is said that he waited an entire year until that person finally returned to the place in which he Ishamel was supposed to have met the former; and he was a messenger to the tribe of Jurhum a prophet likewise."
