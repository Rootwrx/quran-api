So if there be read as yakun or takun a hundred of you steadfast they will overcome two hundred of them; and if there be a thousand of you they will overcome two thousand by the leave of God by His will this is predicative functioning as an imperative in other words fight twice your number and stand firm against them. And God is with the steadfast by His support of them."
