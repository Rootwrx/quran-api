If there be read as yakun or takun a hundred of you they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve for they are a people who do not understand this sentence is predicative but functions as an imperative in other words let the twenty of you fight the two hundred of them and the hundred of you the thousand of them and let them stand firm against them; but when they became numerous this was abrogated by Godâ€™s saying"
