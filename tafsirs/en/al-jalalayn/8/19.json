Whoever among the two of us is the one who has severed the ties of kinship and brought us what we had never known destroy them today!’ — the judgement the decisive conclusion has now come to you by the fact that the one so described has already perished this was Abū Jahl and those killed with him and not the Prophet s and the believers; and if you desist from unbelief and waging war it will better for you. But if you return to fight against the Prophet s We shall return to assist him against you and your host your troops will not avail will not protect you in any way however numerous it be; and verily God is with the believers read thus inna indicating a new sentence; or read anna with an implicit lām li-anna‘Llāha ma‘a’l-mu’minīn ‘because God is with the believers’."
