  "text": "Truly those who believed and emigrated and strove with their wealth and their lives in the way of God these being the Emigrants and those who provided refuge for the Prophet s and assisted these being the Helpers those are allies of one another in terms of mutual support and inheritance. And those who believed but did not emigrate — you have no duty to make an alliance read wilāya or walāya with them and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for them until they emigrate this was abrogated by the end of this sūra; but if they ask you for assistance in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist them against the disbelievers except against a folk between whom and you there is a covenant a pact in which case do not assist them against these others and so break your pact; and God sees what you do."
