  "text": "‘They question you O Muhammad (s) concerning the spoils of war — the booty — to whom do they belong? Say to them ‘The spoils of war belong to God Who places them where He will and the Messenger who divides them according to God’s command. The Prophet s divided these spoils between them equally as reported by al-Hākim in his al-Mustadrak. So fear God and set things right between you that is set right the reality of that state of affairs which is between you through mutual affection and the refraining from quarrelling; and obey God and His Messenger if you are truly believers’."
