  "text": "Verily God has prescribed He has made lawful for you when necessary the absolution of your oaths to absolve them by expiation as mentioned in the sūrat al-Mā’ida Q. 589 and the forbidding of sexual relations with a handmaiden counts as an oath so did the Prophet s expiate? Muqātil b. Sulaymān said ‘He set free a slave in expiation for his prohibition of Māriya’; whereas al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘He never expiated because the Prophet s has been forgiven all errors’. And God is your Protector your Helper and He is the Knower the Wise."
