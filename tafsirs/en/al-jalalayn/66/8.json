Their light will be running before them in front of them and it will be on their right. They will say yaqūlūna this denotes the beginning of a new syntactically independent sentence ‘Our Lord! Perfect our light for us towards Paradise — whereas the hypocrites their light will be extinguished — and forgive us Our Lord. Assuredly You have power over all things’."
