  "text": "And there came a caravan — travellers going from Midian to Egypt who stopped near to Joseph’s well — and they sent their water-drawer the one who goes down to the water source to draw from it and he let down his bucket into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out and when he saw him he said ‘Good news!’ a variant reading of yā bushrā has yā bushrāya this vocative call is figurative in other words it is to be understood as ‘Come O good news now is your time!’ ‘This is a young boy’. His brothers became aware of this and came to him and they hid him that is they disguised his real status claiming that he was as a piece of merchandise by saying ‘This is a slave of ours he is a runaway’; but Joseph did not say anything fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what they were doing."
