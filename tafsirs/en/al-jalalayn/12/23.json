  "text": "And she in whose house he was — namely Zulaykhā — attempted to seduce him that is she asked him to lie with her and she closed the doors of the house. And she said to him ‘Come!’ hayta laka the lām of laka is for clarification; a variant reading has hīta laka or haytu laka. ‘God forbid!’ I seek refuge with God from this he said. ‘Truly he who bought me is my lord my master who has given me an honourable place an honourable residence and so I cannot betray him with regard to his family. Truly evildoers fornicators never prosper’."
