  "text": "You do not worship apart from Him that is other than Him anything but mere names that you have named that you have named for idols you and your fathers. God has not revealed any warrant any definitive argument or proof regarding them regarding worship of them. Judgement decree belongs only to God alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That affirmation of God’s Oneness is the upright the straight religion but most people — and these are the disbelievers — do not know the punishment in which they shall end up and so they ascribe partners to God."
