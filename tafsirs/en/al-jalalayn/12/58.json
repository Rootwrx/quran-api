  "text": "And Joseph’s brothers came — except for Benjamin — in order to secure provisions when they found out that the new Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its fair price; and they entered to him and he recognised them to be his brothers but they did not recognise him not knowing who he was because it had been a long time since they had seen him and because they supposed that he had died. They spoke to him in Hebrew and he said to them as if reproaching them ‘What brings you to my land?’ They replied ‘We have come for supplies’. He said ‘You might be spies!’ They said ‘God forbid!’ He said ‘So where are you from?’ They said ‘From the land of Canaan our father is Jacob the prophet of God.’ He said ‘Does he have children other than you?’ They said ‘Yes. We used to be twelve but the youngest of us passed away he perished in the wild. He was the most beloved to him our father from among us; only his full brother remains and so he keeps him by his side in order to comfort himself with him in place of the other.’ He Joseph commanded that they be given lodging and treated well."
