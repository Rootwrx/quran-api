  "text": "And there entered the prison with him two youths two young men servants of the king one of whom was his cup-bearer the other his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so they said ‘Let us try him’. One of them the cup-bearer said ‘I dreamed that I was pressing wine’ that is grapes. The other the food-taster said ‘I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Tell us inform us of its interpretation for indeed we see you as being among the virtuous’."
