As for one of you that is the cup-bearer he will depart after three days and he shall serve his lord his master wine to drink as usual; and as for the other he will depart after three days and he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head this is the interpretation of both your dreams. They said ‘We never dreamed a thing!’; he said decided concluded is the matter regarding which you sought opinion’ about which you enquired whether you spoke truthfully or were lying."
