  "text": "And he raised his parents he seated them next to him upon the throne and they fell down that is his parents and brothers prostrating before him — a prostration that was actually a bowing down not placing their foreheads down on the ground; this was their standard form of greeting at that time. Then he said ‘O father this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me since He brought me out of the prison — he did not say ‘out of the well’ in a show of magnanimity lest his brothers feel ashamed — and has brought you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling made trouble between me and my brethren. Truly my Lord is Subtle in bringing about what He will. Truly He is the Knower of His creatures the Wise in His actions. His father Jacob remained with him for 24 years or for 17 years. The duration of his separation from Joseph had been 18 or 40 or 80 years. When death approached him he charged Joseph to take him and bury him by his father Isaac and so he Joseph himself went and buried him there. He Joseph then returned to Egypt and remained alive for another 23 years."
