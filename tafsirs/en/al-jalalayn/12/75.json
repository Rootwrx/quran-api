  "text": "They said ‘His requital qālū jazā’uhu the subject the predicate of which is the following man wujida fī rahlihi shall be the requital of him in whose saddlebag it is found that he be enslaved — this is then reiterated by His words He the thief shall be the requital for it that is for the stolen item and nothing else this was the customary practice of the family of Jacob. Thus with such a requital do we requite those who do evil’ through theft. They thus permitted Joseph to have their saddlebags searched."
