  "text": "He Joseph asked them about his father; and they told him that his eyesight had gone. And so he said Go with this shirt of mine — and this was the shirt of Abraham the one he wore when he was thrown into the fire; he Joseph had it around his neck when he was at the bottom of the well. It the shirt had come from Paradise Gabriel commanded him Joseph to send it off to Jacob saying that the scent of Paradise lingers in it and whenever it is cast upon a sufferer it heals him — and lay it on my father’s face and he will recover his sight; and bring me all your folk’."
