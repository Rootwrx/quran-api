  "text": "And the king said ‘Bring him to me that I may use him for myself’ that I may make him mine exclusively with none to share him with me. The messenger came to him to Joseph and said ‘Respond to the king!’ and so he got up and bid farewell to his fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He then washed himself put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with him he said to him ‘Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy’ a person of status entrusted over our affair so what do you think we should do? He said ‘Gather food stocks and sow abundantly in these fertile years then store the corn in its ears. People from far and wide will come to you and ask you to supply them with provisions’. He the king said ‘Whom can I delegate this task to?’"
