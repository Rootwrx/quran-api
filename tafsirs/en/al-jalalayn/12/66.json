  "text": "He said ‘I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge a covenant in the name of God by your swearing an oath that assuredly you will bring him back to me unless you are besieged’ such that you die or are overwhelmed and thus unable to bring him back. They agreed to this. And when they gave him their solemn pledge to this effect he said ‘God shall be Guardian Witness over what we say’ we and you. Thus he sent him with them."
