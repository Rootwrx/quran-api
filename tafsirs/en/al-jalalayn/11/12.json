  "text": "Perhaps O Muhammad (s) you might think to leave out some of what is revealed to you such that you do not convey it to them for they do not take it seriously and that your breast should be straitened by it by reciting it to them because they say ‘Why has a treasure not been sent down for him or an angel not come with him?’ to confirm his sincerity as we had requested? You are but a warner and yours is only to convey the Message not to produce what they have requested; and God is Guardian over all things He is Preserver of all things so He will requite them accordingly."
