Those they shall be brought before their Lord on the Day of Resurrection amid the rest of creation and the witnesses ashhād is the plural of shāhid namely the angels who will bear witness that the messengers conveyed the Message and that the disbelievers denied them will say ‘These are they who lied concerning their Lord’. Surely the curse of God is upon the wrong-doers the idolaters;"
