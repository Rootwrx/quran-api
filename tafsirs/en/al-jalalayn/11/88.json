And I do not desire to be inconsistent and then partake in what I forbid you thus committing the same. I desire only to set things right in your case by way of enjoining justice so far as I am able. My success my ability to do this successfully and to enjoin other acts of obedience is only with God. In Him I trust and to Him I turn I return repentant."
