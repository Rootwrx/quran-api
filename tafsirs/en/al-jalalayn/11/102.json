Truly His seizing is painful severe. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported by way of an isnād from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that he said ‘The Prophet s said “God gives extended respite to the evildoer but when He seizes him there is no escape for him” whereupon the Prophet s recited the verse Such is the seizing of your Lord Q. 11102 above’."
