No! Those that is the ones who rely on a clear proof they believe in it that is in the Qur’ān and so for them will be Paradise; but he who disbelieves in it of the partisans namely all the disbelievers the Fire shall be his appointed place. So do not be in doubt in uncertainty concerning it concerning the Qur’ān. Truly it is the Truth from your Lord but most of mankind that is the people of Mecca do not believe."
