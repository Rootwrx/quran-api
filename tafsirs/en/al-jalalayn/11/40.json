According to the story God gathered for Noah all the beasts of prey and birds and other animals; he Noah would go through every species to select them with his hands and his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female whereupon he would take them aboard the ship; and your family — that is his wife and children — save those against whom the Word has already gone forth from among them that they be destroyed this was his wife and his son Canaan in contrast with Shem Ham and Japheth whom he took aboard together with their three wives and those who believe’. And none but a few believed with him it is said that these were six men and their wives; it is also said that the number of all those aboard the ship was eighty half of whom were men and the other half women."
