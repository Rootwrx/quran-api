It is also said that it was revealed regarding the hypocrites Lo! they fold up their breasts that they may hide from Him that is from God; lo! the moment they cover themselves with their garments wrapping themselves up therewith He God exalted be He knows what they keep hidden and what they proclaim and so their hiding is to no avail. Truly He knows what is in the breasts of men that is what is in the hearts."
