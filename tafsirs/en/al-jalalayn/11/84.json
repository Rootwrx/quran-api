I see you in prosperity enjoying a grace which precludes any need for stinting people; and I fear for you should you not believe the chastisement of a besetting day besetting you destroying you the attribution of this term ‘besetting’ to ‘a day’ as opposed to ‘the chastisement’ is figurative for it the chastisement will take place thereupon."
