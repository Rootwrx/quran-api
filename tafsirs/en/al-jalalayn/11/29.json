My wage my reward falls only upon God and I will not drive away those who believe as you have commanded me; they shall surely meet their Lord at the Resurrection and He will requite them and exact vengeance for them from those who wronged them and drove them away. But I see you are a people who are ignorant of the consequence of your affair."
