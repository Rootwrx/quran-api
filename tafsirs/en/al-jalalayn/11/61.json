He it is Who produced you Who began your creation from the earth by creating your father Adam from it and has given you to live therein He has made you inhabitants living therein; so ask forgiveness of Him from idolatry then turn return to Him repentant through acts of obedience. Truly my Lord is Near to His creation by virtue of His knowledge Responsive’ to those who ask of Him."
