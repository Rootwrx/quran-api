  "text": "Those that is these verses containing stories such as the story of Noah are of the tidings of the Unseen of the tales of that which was hidden from you which We inspire in you O Muhammad (s). You yourself did not know it nor did your people know it before this Qur’ān. So be patient in conveying the Message and in enduring your people’s hurt as Noah endured. Truly the praiseworthy sequel is for those who are God-fearing."
