  "text": "And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is the knowledge of what is concealed within them and to Him all matters are returned read active yarji‘u meaning ‘return’ or passive yurja‘u meaning ‘are returned’ and He will exact retribution from those who were disobedient. So worship Him affirm His Oneness and rely on Him trust in Him for He is sufficient for you and your Lord is not heedless of what they do but He defers dealing with them until their appointed time a variant reading has ta‘malūn ‘what you do’."
