  "text": "Those who avoid grave sins and abominations excepting lesser offences that is minor sins such as a look a kiss or a touch this constitutes a discontinuous exception in other words the meaning is but lesser offences are forgiven by the avoidance of grave sins. Truly your Lord is of vast forgiveness for such lesser sins and for accepting repentance. The following was revealed regarding those who used to say ‘What of our prayers our fasting and our pilgrimage!’. He knows you best from the time when He produced you from the earth that is to say when He created your father Adam from dust and when you were hidden fetuses ajinna is the plural of janīn in the bellies of your mothers. So do not claim purity for yourselves do not praise yourselves that is in admiration; but if it is done in recognition of God’s grace then that is fine. He knows best those who are God-fearing."
