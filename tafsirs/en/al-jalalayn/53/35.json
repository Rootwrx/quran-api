  "text": "Does he possess knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees? and therefore from among such knowledge he is able to know that another person may bear the chastisement of the Hereafter for him? No! This was al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra or someone else the sentence beginning with a-‘indahu ‘does he possess’ is the second object of the a-ra’ayta ‘have you seen’ which has the significance of ‘inform Me!’."
