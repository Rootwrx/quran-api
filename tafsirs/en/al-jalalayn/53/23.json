God has not revealed any warrant any proof or evidence for them that is to say for the worship of them. They follow nothing but conjecture in their worship of them and that which ignoble souls desire of that which Satan adorned for them that they may intercede for them before God exalted be He even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord by the tongue of the Prophet s with definitive proof; yet they do not desist from their ways."
