  "text": "Lo! there you are O those who are being called to expend in the way of God that which has been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul one may say bakhila ‘alayhi or bakhila ‘anhu to mean ‘he was niggardly to someone’. For God is the Independent One without need of your expending; while you are the needy of Him. And if you turn away from obedience to Him He will replace you with another people that is to say He will bring them in your place and they will not be the likes of you in turning away from obedience to Him but they will be obedient to Him Mighty and Majestic is He."
