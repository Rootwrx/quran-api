Indeed he did do this. The Prophet s said ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business and your place of rest when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words He has knowledge of all your states nothing of which can be hidden from Him so be mindful of Him — the address in this verse is meant for believers as well as others."
