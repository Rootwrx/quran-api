They have truly despaired of the Hereafter of attaining its reward — despite their being certain of its truth out of obstinacy towards the Prophet even though they know him to be sincere — just as the disbelievers have despaired — they themselves being — of those who are in the tombs that is to say those who are entombed and barred from the good of the Hereafter for they are shown both their would-have-been places in Paradise had they believed and the Fire for which they are destined."
