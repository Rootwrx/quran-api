  "text": "O Prophet if believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not ascribe anything as partner to God and that they will not steal nor commit adultery nor slay their children as used to be done during the time of pagandom jāhiliyya when they would bury new-born girls alive fearing ignominy and impoverishment nor bring any lie that they have invented originating between their hands and their legs that is by bringing a foundling which they then falsely ascribe to the husband — it the lie is described in terms of a real child because when a woman gives birth to a child it falls between her hands and legs; nor disobey you in doing what is decent which is that which concords with obedience to God such as refraining from wailing ripping apart their clothes in grief pulling out their hair tearing open the front of their garments or scratching their faces then accept their allegiance — the Prophet s did this but in words and he did not shake hands with any of them — and ask God to forgive them; surely God is Forgiving Merciful."
