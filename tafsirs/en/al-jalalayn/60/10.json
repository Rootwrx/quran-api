  "text": "O you who believe when believing women come to you saying with their tongues that they are emigrating from the company of disbelievers — this was following the truce concluded with them the disbelievers at al-Hudaybiyya to the effect that if any of their number should go to join the believers that person should be sent back — test them by making them swear that they had only gone forth from Mecca because of their sincere wish to embrace Islam and not out of some hatred for their disbelieving husbands nor because they might be enamoured by some Muslim man that was how the Prophet s used to take from them their oaths. God knows best the state of their faith. Then if you know them if you suppose them on the basis of their oaths to be believers do not send them back to the disbelievers. They the women are not lawful for them nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them. And give them that is to say their disbelieving husbands what they have expended on them on such women in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them on that previous condition when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on read tumassikū or tumsikū to the conjugal ties of disbelieving women your wives for your Islam automatically prohibits you from this or to the ties of those apostatising women who return to the idolaters for likewise their apostatising automatically prohibits you from marrying them and ask for demand the return of what you have expended on these women of dowries in the event of apostasy from those disbelievers to whom they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended on those women who have emigrated as explained above that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you therewith and God is Knower Wise."
