  "text": "And if you lose any of your wives that is to say if you lose one or more of them — or it means if you lose anything of their dowries — by their going to the disbelievers as apostates and so you retaliate you embark upon a raid and capture spoils from them then give those whose wives have gone from the spoils the like of what they have expended for their having lost it to the disbelievers. And fear God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the way of paying back the disbelievers the dowries of their former wives and the believers the dowries of the women who had apostatised. Afterwards however this stipulation was annulled."
