  "text": "There is no blame upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick that they be one’s table companions nor any blame upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses that is from the houses of your offspring or your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or from that whereof you hold the keys from that which you safeguard on behalf of others or from those of your faithful friends sadīq is so called because he is ‘faithful’ sadaqa to you in his affection. In other words one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned even if they are not present provided that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together in a group or separately individually ashtāt is the plural of shatt. This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about eating alone and who when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. But when you enter houses that are yours houses wherein there is no one bid peace to yourselves say ‘Peace be upon us and upon God’s righteous servants’ for the angels will return your greeting; and if there is family therein bid peace to them with a salutation tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayyā ‘he saluted’ from God blessed and good and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for you that is to say He sets out for you in detail the ritual ceremonies of your religion that perhaps you might comprehend in order for you to understand this."
