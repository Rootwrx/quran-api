  "text": "Say ‘Obey God and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away from obedience to him tawallaw ‘you turn away’ one of the two tā’ letters in tatawallaw has been omitted; an address to them know that he is only responsible for that with which he has been charged of conveying the Message and you are responsible for that with which you have been charged of obedience to him. And if you obey him you will be rightly guided. And the Messenger’s duty is only to convey the Message clearly’."
