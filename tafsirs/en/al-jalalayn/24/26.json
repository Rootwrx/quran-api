Good women and as mentioned good words are for good men and good men for good women and the mentioned good words that is to say what suits something vile is its like and what suits something good is its like — such good men and women the like of ‘Ā’isha and Safwān are absolved of what they say what the corrupt men and women say about them. For them for good men and women will be forgiveness and a glorious provision in Paradise. ‘Ā’isha felt honoured by some of the things mentioned in this verse namely that she was created ‘a good woman’ and was promised ‘forgiveness and a glorious provision’."
