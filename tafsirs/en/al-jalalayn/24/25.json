Among such people is ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy. The ‘honourable women’ mentioned above are the Prophet’s s wives regarding whom no repentance has been mentioned as being possible in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom repentance has been mentioned however at the beginning of the sūra verses 4-5 in the case of their being falsely accused are women other these wives of the Prophet."
