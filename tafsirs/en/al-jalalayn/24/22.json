  "text": "And do not let those of you who possess bounty the wealthy and the affluent swear not to give to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God — this was revealed regarding Abū Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah his maternal cousin a destitute Emigrant who had fought at the battle of Badr because of his involvement in the calumny when thitherto he had provided for him. And it was revealed also regarding certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms to those who had participated in spreading the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse them in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving Merciful to believers. Abū Bakr said ‘Indeed. I would love that God forgive me’ and he restored thereafter to Mistah what he used to expend on him."
