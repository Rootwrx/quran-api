  "text": "O you who believe do not follow in the steps of Satan that is his ways of making things seem attractive. For whoever follows in the steps of Satan assuredly he the one being followed enjoins indecency that is he enjoins vile acts and what is reprehensible if followed according to the Law. And were it not for Godâ€™s bounty to you and His mercy not one of you O band of accusers would ever have grown pure after the calumny of which you spoke that is to say not one of you would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will from sin by accepting his repentance from him and God is Hearer of what you have said Knower of your intentions."
