Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously that is those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave hiding behind something qad ‘verily’ is for confirmation. So let those who contravene His command that is God’s command or that of His Messenger beware lest an ordeal a trial befall them or there befall them a painful chastisement in the Hereafter."
