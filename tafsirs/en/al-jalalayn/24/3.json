  "text": "The fornicator shall not marry anyone but a fornicatress or an idolatress and the fornicatress shall be married by none except a fornicator or an idolator in other words what is suitable for each of the two for the purposes of marriage is the above-mentioned; and that namely marrying of fornicators is forbidden to believers who are better than those. This was revealed when the poor among the Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters so that they the women would provide for them. Thus it is said that the prohibition applies specifically to them; but it is also said to apply in general; but it was abrogated by Godâ€™s words Marry off the spouseless among you Q. 2432."
