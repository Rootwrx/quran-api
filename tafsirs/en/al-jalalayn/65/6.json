  "text": "Lodge them that is the divorced women where you dwell that is to say in some part of your dwellings in accordance with your means min wujdikum is an explicative supplement or a substitution of what precedes it with the repetition of the same preposition min and with an implied genitive annexation in other words something like amkinat sa‘atikum ‘house them in the places of your means and not otherwise’ and do not harass them so as to put them in straits with regard to accommodation such that they would then need to go elsewhere or be in need of maintenance to provide for themselves so that they are forced to ransom themselves from you. And if they are pregnant then maintain them until they deliver. Then if they suckle for you your children whom you have from them give them their wages for the suckling and consult together with them honourably with kindness for the sake of the children by mutual agreement on a fixed wage for the suckling. But if you both make difficulties regarding the suckling with either the father withholding payment of the wage or the mother refraining from performing it then another woman will suckle the child for him for the father and the mother should not be compelled to suckle it."
