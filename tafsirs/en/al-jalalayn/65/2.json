And call to witness two just men from among yourselves to witness the retraction or the separation and bear witness for the sake of God and not merely for the sake of what is being witnessed or for the sake of the man. By this is exhorted whoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whoever fears God He will make a way out for him from the distress of this world and the Hereafter;"
