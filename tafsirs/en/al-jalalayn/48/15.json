  "text": "Those mentioned who were left behind will say when you set forth after spoils namely the spoils of Khaybar in order to capture them ‘Let us follow you’ that we might also take a share of it. They desire thereby to change the words of God kalāma’Llāhi a variant reading has kalima’Llāhi in other words His promising of the spoils of Khaybar exclusively for those who were at al-Hudaybiyya. Say ‘You shall never follow us! Thus has God said beforehand’ that is prior to our return. Then they will say ‘Nay but you are envious of us’ lest we might acquire a share of the spoils and therefore you say this that you say. Nay but they never understood anything of religion all except a few of them."
