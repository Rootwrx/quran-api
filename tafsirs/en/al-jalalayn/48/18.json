  "text": "Verily God was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you at al-Hudaybiyya under the tree this was an acacia â€” they these believers numbered 1300 or more; he took an oath of allegiance from them that they would fight against Quraysh and not attempt to flee from death. And He God knew what was in their hearts of sincerity and loyalty so He sent down the spirit of Peace upon them and rewarded them with a near victory which was the conquest of Khaybar following their departure from al-Hudaybiyya"
