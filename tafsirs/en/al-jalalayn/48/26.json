  "text": "When those who disbelieve alladhīna kafarū is the subject of the following verb ja‘ala nourished idh ja‘ala is semantically connected to ‘adhdhabnā in their hearts zealotry al-hamiyya means ‘disdain of something’ the zealotry of pagandom hamiyyata’l-jāhiliyyati substitutes for al-hamiyyata ‘zealotry’ namely their barring of the Prophet and his Companions from visiting the Sacred Mosque but then God sent down His spirit of Peace upon His Messenger and the believers and so they the disbelievers made a truce with them on the condition that they the believers would be allowed to return the following year and such zealotry would not overcome them the believers as it did the disbelievers then until they would come to fight them later and He made them the believers abide by the word of God-fearing kalimata’l-taqwā ‘there is no god except God and Muhammad is His Messenger’ it kalima ‘word’ is annexed to al-taqwā because it is the cause of it for they were worthier of it of the word than the disbelievers and deserving of it wa-ahlahā is an explanatory supplement. And God is ever Knower of all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute and among the things He knows is that they are worthy of it."
