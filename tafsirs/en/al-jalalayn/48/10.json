  "text": "Truly those who pledge allegiance to you the ‘Pledge of Beatitude’ bay‘at al-ridwān given at al-Hudaybiyya in fact pledge allegiance to God — this statement is akin to Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God Q. 480. The Hand of God is above their hands the hands with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet in other words God exalted be He has observed their pledge of allegiance and will requite them in accordance with their adherence to it. So whoever reneges whoever breaches the pledge reneges — that is the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be — against his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God He will give him fa-sa-yu’tīhi; or read fa-sa-nu’tīhi ‘We will give him’ a great reward."
