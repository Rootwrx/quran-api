  "text": "God has promised you abundant spoils which you will capture through the various conquests. So He has expedited this one the spoils of Khaybar for you and withheld men’s hands from you with regard to your families after you had set off on the campaign as the Jews had intended to plot against them; but God cast terror into their hearts; so that it the expedited one wa-li-takūna is a supplement to an implied verb that is to say li-tashkurūhu ‘that you may give thanks to Him’ may be a sign for the believers of their being assisted by God and that He may guide you on a straight path that is to say the way in which you should rely on Him and entrust any affair to Him exalted be He;"
