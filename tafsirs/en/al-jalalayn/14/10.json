He calls you to obedience of Him so that He might forgive you your sins min dhunūbikum min is extra since through submission to the One God all that may have been committed previously is forgiven or else it min ‘some of’ is partitive intended to state that forgiveness which is due to God’s servants and defer you without chastisement to an appointed term’ the term of death. They said ‘You are but mortals like us desiring to bar us from that which our fathers used to worship in the way of idols. So bring us a clear warrant’ a manifest argument demonstrating your truthfulness."
