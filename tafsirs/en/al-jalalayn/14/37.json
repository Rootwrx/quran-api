  "text": "Our Lord indeed I have made some of my seed that is Ishmael and his mother Hagar to dwell in a valley where there is no sown land namely Mecca by Your Sacred House which had been there since before the Flood our Lord that they may establish prayer. So make some of the hearts of men yearn incline and long towards them — Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘Had He said “Make all the hearts of men …” assuredly the Persians the Byzantines and all of mankind would have yearned towards them’. And provide them with fruits that they might be thankful and this petition was granted for the town of al-Tā’if was transferred to that land."
