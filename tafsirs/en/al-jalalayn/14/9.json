  "text": "Has there not come to you an interrogative meant as an affirmative the tidings the news of those who were before you — the people of Noah and ‘Ād — the people of Hūd — and Thamūd — the people of Sālih — and those after them? None knows them save God. This is on account of their multitude. Their messengers brought them clear signs with lucid arguments demonstrating their truthfulness; but they that is the communities thrust their hands into their mouths to bite on them out of extreme spite and said ‘Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent according to what you claim and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us’ doubt creating great uncertainty."
