  "text": "And We sent to Midian their brother Shu‘ayb. He said ‘O my people worship God! You have no god other than Him. Verily there has come to you a clear proof a miracle from your Lord to prove my truthfulness. So give full measure and weight and do not defraud diminish the value of people’s goods and do not work corruption in the earth by way of unbelief and acts of disobedience after it has been set right through the sending of messengers thereto. That mentioned is better for you if you are believers if you are seekers of faith so hasten to it."
