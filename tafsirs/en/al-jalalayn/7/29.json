And set wa-aqīmū is a supplement to the syntactical significance of bi’l-qist ‘justice’ that is to say it is as if He said ‘Be just and set your faces’ or read wa-aqīmū with an implied fa-aqbilū ‘so turn’ towards it your faces towards God in every place of worship performing your prostrations purely for Him and call upon Him worship Him devoting your religion to Him free of any idolatry. As He brought you into being as He created you when you were nothing so you will return that is so He will bring you back to life on the Day of Resurrection."
