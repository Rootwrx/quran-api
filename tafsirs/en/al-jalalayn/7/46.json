  "text": "And between them that is between the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire is a veil a barrier said to be the wall of the Heights and on the Heights which is the wall of Paradise are men whose good deeds and evil deeds are equal as is stated in the hadīth who know each of the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire by their mark — glowing faces in the case of the believers and blackened ones in the case of the disbelievers for they are able to see them their position being high — and they call to the inhabitants of Paradise ‘Peace be upon you!’ God exalted be He says They that is those men of the Heights have not entered it Paradise although they aspire to enter it. Al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘God causes them to have this aspiration only because He desires to be generous to them’. Al-Hākim reported that Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān said ‘While they are in this situation God appears to them and says “Get up and enter Paradise for I have forgiven you”.’"
