On the day when its fulfilment comes which will be on the Day of Resurrection those who were forgetful of it before those who neglected to believe in it shall say ‘Indeed our Lord’s messengers came with the truth. Have we then any intercessors that they may intercede for us or shall we be returned to the world that we may act otherwise than we used to act?’ and instead affirm God’s Oneness and refrain from associating others with Him. It will then be said to them ‘No!’ God exalted be He says Verily they have lost their souls for they have ended up in perdition and that which they used to invent in alleging that God has a partner has failed has abandoned them."
