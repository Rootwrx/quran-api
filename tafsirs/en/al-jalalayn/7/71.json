Do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named that is with which you you and your fathers have named idols that you worship for which that is for the worship of which God has not revealed any warrant? any definitive argument or proof? Then await the chastisement. Truly I shall be with you waiting’ for that on account of your denial of me thus a blighting wind was unleashed against them cf. Q. 514."
