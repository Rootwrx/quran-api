  "text": "As for the good land the one of rich soil its vegetation comes forth wholesomely by permission of its Lord — this is a similitude of the believer who when he hears an admonition he heeds it and benefits from it. While as for the one whose soil is bad — the vegetation in it comes forth only miserably laboriously and with difficulty — this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Even as We have made clear what has been mentioned so We dispense We make clear the signs for a people who are thankful to God and so believe."
