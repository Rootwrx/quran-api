  "text": "Those who deny Our signs and scorn them not believing in them indeed the gates of heaven shall not be opened for them when their spirits are carried up to it after death for instead they are taken down into Sijjīn cf. Q. 837f. — in contrast to the believer for whom the gates are opened and his spirit is carried up into the seventh heaven as is stated in one hadīth — nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle which is impossible and so is their entry into Paradise. So with this requital We requite those who are sinful through disbelief."
