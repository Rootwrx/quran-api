He Moses then departed with them; but when the Trembling a violent earthquake seized them Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘That earthquake was because they did not separate themselves from their people when the latter took to worshipping the calf’; he Ibn ‘Abbās added ‘These people were not the same ones who asked to see God and were struck by the thunderbolt cf. Q. 255’ he Moses said ‘My Lord had You willed You would have destroyed them long before that is before my departure with them so that the Children of Israel might see this and not make false accusations against me and me with them. Will You destroy us for what the foolish ones among us have done? this interrogative is meant as a plea for compassion in other words ‘Do not punish us for the sins of others’. It that is the trial which the ignorant ones underwent is but Your trial Your test whereby You send astray whom You will to lead stray and guide whom You will to guide. You are our Protector looking after our affairs so forgive us and have mercy on us for You are the Best of all who show forgiveness."
