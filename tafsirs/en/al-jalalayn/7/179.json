  "text": "And We have indeed urged unto Hell many of the jinn and mankind having hearts wherewith they do not understand the truth and having eyes wherewith they do not perceive the proofs of God’s power with a perception that entails reflection and having ears wherewith they do not hear the signs or the admonitions in a way so as to reflect and take heed. These they are like cattle in their failure to understand perceive or listen — nay rather they are further astray than cattle because at least they cattle seek what is beneficial to them and stay away from what is harmful to them these individuals on the other hand are proceeding towards the Fire out of sheer obstinacy. These — they are the heedless."
