Then when he covered her when he had sexual intercourse with her she bore a light burden namely the sperm-drop and moved to and fro with it that is she came and went easily on account of its lightness; but when she became heavy because of the child growing inside her and they became anxious that it should be a dumb child they cried to God their Lord ‘If You give us one a child that is sound unimpaired we indeed shall be of the thankful’ to You for it."
