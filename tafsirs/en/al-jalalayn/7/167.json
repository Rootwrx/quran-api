  "text": "And when your Lord proclaimed made it known that He would send against them that is the Jews to the Day of Resurrection those who would inflict on them grievous torment through humiliation and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them. Thus God sent Solomon against them and after him Nebuchadnezzar who slaughtered some of them and took others among them captive and imposed the jizya-tax on them. They continued to pay this tax to the Magians up until the time of the sending of our Prophet s who also imposed it on them. Lo! verily your Lord is swift in requital of those who disobey Him. And lo! verily He is Forgiving to those who obey Him Merciful in dealing with them."
