  "text": "Are these the ones of whom you swore that God would never grant them mercy?’ it has already been said to them ‘Enter Paradise; no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ a variant reading for udkhulū ‘enter’ imperative second person plural has the passive udkhilū ‘they have been admitted’ or dakhalū ‘they entered’; the negation clause ‘no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they enter Paradise while this is being said to them."
