Not secret conversation of three takes place but He is their fourth companion by virtue of His omniscience nor of five but He is their sixth nor of fewer than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Assuredly God has knowledge of all things."
