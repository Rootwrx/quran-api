For those the ones who are not loving of them He has inscribed He has established faith upon their hearts and reinforced them with a spirit a light from Him exalted be He and He will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide God being pleased with them for their obedience of Him and they being pleased with Him because of His reward. Those they are God’s confederates following His command and refraining from what He has forbidden. Assuredly it is God’s confederates who are the successful the winners."
