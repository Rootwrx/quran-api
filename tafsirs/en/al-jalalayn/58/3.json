  "text": "And those who repudiate their wives by zihār and then go back on what they have said instead doing the opposite of this and retaining the woman divorced by zihār that which is contrary to the purpose of zihār in which a woman is characterised as being forbidden — then the penalty for them is the setting free of a slave an obligation upon him before they touch one another in sexual intercourse. By this you are being admonished; and God is Aware of what you do."
