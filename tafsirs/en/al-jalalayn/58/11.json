  "text": "O you who believe when it is said to you ‘Make room’ during the assembly during the assembly convened with the Prophet s or for remembrance so that those arriving to join you may find room to sit al-majlis ‘assembly’ may also be read in the plural al-majālis then make room; God will make room for you in Paradise. And when it is said ‘Rise up’ stand up for prayer or for other good deeds do rise up a variant reading for unshuzū fa’nshuzū has anshizū in both instances sc. anshizū fa’nshizū; God will raise those of you who have faith thereby obeying this command and He will raise those who have been given knowledge by degrees in Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do."
