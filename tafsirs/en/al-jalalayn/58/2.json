  "text": "Those of you who repudiate their wives by zihār yazzahharūna is actually yatazahharūna in which the tā’ has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has yazzāharūna and still another has yuzāhirūna similar in form to yuqātilūna; the same applies for the second instance of this verb below they are not their mothers; their mothers are only those who read allā’ī or without the final long yā’ allā’i gave birth to them and indeed they in repudiating them by zihār utter indecent words and a calumny a lie. Yet assuredly God is Pardoning Forgiving to the one who repudiates by zihār through an atonement which he must offer."
