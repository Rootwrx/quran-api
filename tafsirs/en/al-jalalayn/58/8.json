  "text": "Have you not seen have you not observed those who were forbidden from conversing in secret but then returned to that they had been forbidden and all the while hold secret conversations tainted with sin and plans for enmity and disobedience to the Messenger? These were the Jews whom the Prophet s had forbidden them what they used to do in their secret talks that is their habit of conversing secretly with one another and giving the believers looks in order to cast doubt into their hearts about the faith. And who when they come to you they greet you O Prophet with that with which God never greeted you — namely their saying to the Prophet al-sāmu ‘alayka meaning ‘Death be upon you’ and they say within themselves ‘Why does God not chastise us for what we say?’ in the way of such a greeting and our saying that he is not a prophet if he truly were a prophet. Hell will suffice them! In it they will be made to burn — and what an evil journey’s end! it is."
