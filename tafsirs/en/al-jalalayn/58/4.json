  "text": "And he who cannot find the wherewithal to set free a slave then his redemption shall be the fasting of two successive months before they touch one another. And if he is unable to fast then the redemption shall be the feeding of sixty needy persons as an obligation upon him that is before they touch one another understanding the unrestricted prescription as having the same restriction as the restricted one. For every needy person he should give one mudd measure of the principal food of the town. This namely lightening of the atonement is so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. And these namely the rulings mentioned are Godâ€™s bounds; and for the rejecters of them there is a painful chastisement."
