Indeed God does not alter the state of a people — He does not deprive them of His grace — unless they have altered the state of their souls from their comely nature through an act of disobedience. And if God wills misfortune chastisement for a people there is none that can repel it either from among the attendant angels or others; and they for whom God wills misfortune have no protector min wālin min is extra to avert it from them apart from Him that is other than God."
