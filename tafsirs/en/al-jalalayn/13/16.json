  "text": "Say O Muhammad (s) to your people ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?’ Say ‘God’ — and even if they do not say it there can be no other response. Say to them ‘Then have you taken beside Him other than Him protectors idols to worship who have no power to benefit or harm themselves?’ and you abandon the One Who is their Possessor? an interrogative meant as a rebuke. Say ‘Are the blind one and the seer respectively the disbeliever and the believer equal? Or are darkness disbelief and the light faith equal? No! Or have they set up for God associates who have created the like of His creation so that creation seems alike that is is what the associates create and the creation of God alike to them?’ so that they believe them worthy of being worshipped on account of what these associates have created? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words not so! None save the Creator is worthy of being worshipped. Say ‘God is the Creator of all things having no associate therein and so He cannot have an associate in terms of worship; and He is the One the Subjugator’ of His servants."
