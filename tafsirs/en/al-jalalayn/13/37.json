And if you should follow their whims that is those of the disbelievers in that to which they summon you of their creed hypothetically speaking after what has come to you of knowledge of God’s Oneness you shall have no protector to assist you against God mina’Llāhi min the second min is extra and no defender to ward off His chastisement."
