  "text": "And indeed those that were before them of communities plotted against their prophets just as they plot against you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God for exalted be He He knows what every soul earns and so its requital is prepared for it and this is the ultimate plotting since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever the genus is meant here; a variant reading has kuffār ‘the disbelievers’ shall assuredly know for whom shall be the sequel of the heavenly Abode that is the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be theirs or that of the Prophet s and his Companions?"
