  "text": "He then strikes a similitude of truth and falsehood saying He exalted be He sends down water rain from the sky whereat the valleys flow according to their measure according to their full capacity and the flood carries a scum that swells rising above it and this scum is the filth and the like that lies on the surface of the earth and from that which they smelt read tūqidūn ‘you smelt’ or yūqidūn ‘they smelt’ in the fire of the earth’s minerals such as gold silver or copper desiring seeking to make ornaments adornment or ware which is useful such as utensils when they the minerals are melted; there rises a scum the like of it that is the like of the scum of the flood and this latter scum consists of the impurities expelled by the bellows. Thus in the way mentioned God points out truth and falsehood that is He points out the similitude thereof. As for the scum of the flood and of the minerals smelted it passes away as dross useless refuse while that which is of use to mankind in the way of water and minerals lingers remains in the earth for a time likewise falsehood wanes and is eventually effaced even if it should prevail over the truth at certain times. Truth on the other hand is established and enduring. Thus in the way mentioned God strikes He makes clear similitudes."
