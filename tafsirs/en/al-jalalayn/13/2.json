  "text": "God is He Who raised up the heavens without visible supports ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is the same as an ustuwāna ‘a column’; and this statement is true since there are no actual supports then presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting Him and disposed made subservient the sun and the moon each one of them moving along its course until the conclusion of an appointed time that is until the Day of Resurrection. He directs the command He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He details He expounds the signs the indications of His power so that you O people of Mecca might be certain of the encounter with your Lord through resurrection."
