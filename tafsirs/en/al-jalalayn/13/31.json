  "text": "The following was revealed when they said to him ‘If you are truly a prophet then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us and make for us rivers and springs in it that we may plant and sow seeds and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet’ Even if it were a Qur’ān whereby the mountains were set in motion moved from their places or the earth were cleft torn or the dead were spoken to such that they would respond they still would not believe. Nay but the affair belongs entirely to God and none other so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes and no other; even if they were given what they request of signs. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested of signs should be manifested hoping that they the ones requesting them might believe Have they not realised those who believe that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu had God willed He could have guided all mankind? to faith without the need for any sign? And the disbelievers from among the people of Mecca continue to be struck by devastation a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship such as being killed taken captive and suffering war or drought because of what they wrought because of their actions that is their disbelief; or you alight O Muhammad (s) together with your army near their home — Mecca — until God’s promise of victory against them comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise and indeed he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;"
