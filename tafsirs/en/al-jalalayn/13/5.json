  "text": "And if you wonder O Muhammad (s) at the disbelievers denying you then surely wondrous surely deserving wonder is their saying in denial of resurrection ‘When we have become dust shall we indeed then be raised in a new creation?’ it is wondrous because the One Who has the power to originate creation and to originate what has been mentioned above without any precedent has also the power to restore them to life both hamzas in both instances a-idhā and a-innā are pronounced; or one may pronounce the first and not pronounce the second but in both cases inserting an alif or not inserting it; one variant reading has the first a-idhā as the interrogative and the second one a-innā as the predicate while another variant reading has the exact opposite. Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; those — fetters shall be around their necks; and those they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein."
