Salām and others from among the believing Jews rejoice in that which has been revealed to you because of its according with what they have with them of revelation; and among the factions that aligned themselves against you in enmity from among the idolaters and the Jews are those who reject some of it such as the mention of the ‘Compassionate One’ al-Rahmān and all that is other than the stories related therein. Say ‘I have been commanded — in that which has been revealed to me — only to worship God and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I call and to Him shall be my return’."
