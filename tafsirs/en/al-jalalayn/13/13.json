He unleashes the thunderbolts — these are a fire which issues forth from the clouds — and smites with them whom He will such that it burns that person this was revealed regarding a man to whom the Prophet s had sent someone to invite to Islam and who said ‘Who is the Messenger of God? And what is God? Is He made of gold or of silver or of copper?’ whereupon a thunderbolt came down on him and blew off the top of his head; yet they that is the disbelievers dispute argue with the Prophet s about God though He is great in might in power or in the severity of His retribution."
