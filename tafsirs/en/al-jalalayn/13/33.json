  "text": "Is He Who stands watches over every soul what it has earned? what it has done of good or evil — and this is God — like the idols who are not so? No! This response is suggested by the following words Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say ‘Name them! for Him who are they? Or will you inform Him will you inform God of something that is of an associate which He does not know in the earth? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words He has no associate for if He did He would know him — exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it — nay — you call them associates merely a manner of speaking?’ that is it is merely on the basis of false conjecture without any truth in it. Nay but their scheming their unbelief has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way from the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray for him there is no guide."
