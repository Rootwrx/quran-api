  "text": "To Him devolves all knowledge of the Hour — when it shall come to pass none other than Him knows this. And no fruit thamaratin a variant reading has the plural thamarātin ‘fruits’ emerges from its sheath its receptacle akmām the plural of kimm except with His knowledge and no female bears child or delivers except with His knowledge. And on the day when He will call out to them ‘Where then are My associates?’ they will say ‘We proclaim to You we now apprise You that there is no witness amongst us’ that is a witness who can testify to the allegation that You have an associate."
