And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned it is said that this statement is made by their skins; but it is also said to be God’s words as is the case with what follows for it is similar in context to what preceded namely that the One with the power to originate you without any precedent and restore you to life after death also has the power to make your skins and your limbs speak."
