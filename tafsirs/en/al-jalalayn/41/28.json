  "text": "That severe chastisement and worst requital is the requital of God’s enemies jazā’u a‘dā’i the second hamza may be pronounced fully or replaced with a wāw — the Fire! al-nāru an explicative supplement to jazā’u ‘the requital’ alluded to by the demonstrative dhālika ‘that’. Therein will be their everlasting abode that is as a place of permanent residence from which there will be no removal as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun from the implicit verbal action for their denial of Our signs for their denial of the Qur’ān."
