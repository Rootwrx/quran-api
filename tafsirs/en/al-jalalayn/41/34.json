Repel the evil deed with that in other words with that trait which is better such as repelling anger with endurance ignorance with forbearance and the intention to inflict harm with pardon then behold he between whom and you there was enmity will be as though he were a dear friend in other words then your enemy will become like a close friend in terms of his affection for you if you act in such a way alladhī ‘he … whom’ is the subject; ka-annahu ‘as though’ is the predicate; idhā is an adverbial particle for expressing the comparative import."
