I do not think that the Hour will ever set in and even if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths I am returned to my Lord I will indeed have the best reward with Him’ namely Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement the lām prefixed in both verbs is that for oaths."
