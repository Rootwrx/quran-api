What! a Qur’ān that is non-Arabic and an Arab prophet?’ this is an interrogative of denial spoken by them; read a-a‘jamiyyun pronouncing both the first and the second hamza or by changing it into an alif and either writing it out in full or not. Say ‘For those who believe it is guidance from error and a healing from the disease of ignorance; but as for those who do not believe there is a deafness in their ears a heaviness and so they are unable to hear it and they are blind to it so they are unable to comprehend it. Those they are as if they were being called from a distant place’ that is to say they are like one who is called from far away unable to hear or comprehend what is being called out to him."
