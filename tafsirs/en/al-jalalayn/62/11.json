  "text": "On one occasion the Prophet s was delivering the Friday sermon when a caravan arrived and so as was the custom drums were beaten to announce its arrival whereat the people began to leave the mosque to go to it all except for twelve men. The following verse was then revealed But when they sight some opportunity for business or a diversion they scatter off towards it that is towards the business since it is what they seek more than diversion and leave you during the sermon standing. Say ‘That which is with God in the way of reward is better for those who believe than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers’. They say that every person ‘provides for’ yarzuqu his dependants by which they mean that such a person does so by means of the provision given by God min rizqi’Llāhi exalted be He."
