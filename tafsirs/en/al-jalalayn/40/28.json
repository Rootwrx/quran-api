If he is lying then his mendacity will be to his own detriment that is the harm resulting from his mendacity will be to his own detriment; but if he is truthful then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you in the way of chastisement soon. Truly God does not guide one who is a prodigal an idolater a liar."
