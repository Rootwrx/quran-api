  "text": "And warn them of the Impending Day namely the Day of Resurrection al-azifa as in azifa al-rahīlu ‘departure is very near’ when the hearts will rising up in fear reach the throats choking with anguish filled with suppressed anxiety kāzimīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-qulūbu ‘the hearts’ which is qualified by the active animate participle plural kāzimīna and referred to as though they were the very individuals themselves. The evildoers will not have any intimate friend any sympathiser nor any intercessor who might be heeded — the adjectival qualification ‘who might be heeded’ has no literal significance for they do not have intercessors in the first place So now we have no intercessors … Q. 26100. The first part however may be said to have significance if understand on the basis of their claim to have intercessors and so in other words even if — hypothetically speaking — they their intercessors did intercede for them they would not be heeded."
