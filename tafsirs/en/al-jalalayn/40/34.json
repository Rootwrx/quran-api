  "text": "And verily Joseph brought you before in other words before Moses — according to one opinion this Joseph is the son of Jacob having been given life until the time of Moses; according to another opinion this is Joseph son of Abraham son of Joseph son of Jacob — clear signs manifest miracles but you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until when he died you said without any evidence to support such a claim “God will never send any messenger after him” — in other words you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others that may come after him. So that is just as you have been led astray God leads astray one who is a prodigal an idolater a skeptic’ a doubter of that which the clear signs have certified."
