Indeed I fear that he may change your religion involving your worship of me so that you will then follow him in his religion or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land’ by initiating killing and otherwise a variant reading for wa-an ‘and that’ is aw-an ‘or that’; a variant reading for an yuzhira fī’l-ardi’l-fasāda is the impersonal construction an yazhara fī’l-ardi’l-fasādu ‘that corruption may appear in the land’."
