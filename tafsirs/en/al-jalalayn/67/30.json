  "text": "Say ‘Have you considered If your water were to sink deep into the earth who then will bring you running water?’ which hands and buckets would be able to reach like they do your water in other words none but God exalted be He would be able to bring it so how can you reject that He will resurrect you? It is commendable for one to say Allāhu rabbu’l-‘ālamīna ‘God Lord of the Worlds!’ after ma‘īn ‘running water’ as is stated in a hadīth. This verse was recited before a certain tyrant who then replied ‘Hatchets and pickaxes will bring it!’ whereupon the water of his eyes dried up and he became blind. We seek refuge with God against that we should be insolent towards Him or His verses."
