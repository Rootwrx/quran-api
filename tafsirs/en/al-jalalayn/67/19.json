  "text": "Or have they not seen the birds above them in the air spreading their wings and closing? their wings after spreading them? in other words read wa-yaqbidna as wa-qābidātin similar to sāffātin ‘spreading’. Nothing sustains them from falling either when they are spreading them or closing them except the Compassionate One by His power. Indeed He is Seer of all things. The meaning is have they not inferred from the fact that the birds are able to remain in the air that We have the power to do with them what has been mentioned above as well as inflicting upon them other kinds of chastisement?"
