  "text": "Those who alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna or constitutes an adjectival qualification of it said to their brothers in religion whilst they themselves had stayed put refraining from joining the struggle ‘Had they the martyrs at Uhud or those who stayed put with us obeyed us they would not have been slain’. Say to them ‘Then avert ward off death from yourselves if you speak the truth’ in that staying put delivers one from it sc. from death."
