This was revealed concerning the Jews two of them fornicated and they the Jews asked the Prophet s to adjudicate the case. He ruled that they be stoned but they the Jews refused to do so. When the Torah was brought and consulted the same verdict was found and so the two were stoned but they the Jews became wrathful."
