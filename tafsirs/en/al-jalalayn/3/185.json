  "text": "Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages the requital of your deeds on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is moved away distanced from the Fire and admitted to Paradise will have triumphed he will have attained his ultimate wish. Living in the life of this world is but the comfort of delusion; of inanity enjoyed for a little while then perishing."
