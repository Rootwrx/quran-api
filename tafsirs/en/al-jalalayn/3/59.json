  "text": "Truly the likeness of Jesus his remarkable case in God’s sight is as Adam’s likeness as the case of Adam whom God created without father or mother this is a comparison of one remarkable thing with another more remarkable so that it convinces the disputer and establishes itself in one’s mind more effectively. He created him Adam that is his form of dust then said He to him ‘Be’ a human being and he was; similarly He said to Jesus ‘Be’ — without a father — and he was."
