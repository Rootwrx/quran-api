Those who were given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians differed in religion some affirming God’s Oneness others rejecting it only after the knowledge of Oneness came to them through transgression on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in God’s signs God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting him."
