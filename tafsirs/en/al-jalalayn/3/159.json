  "text": "It was by the mercy of God that you O Muhammad (s) were lenient with them that is that you showed indulgence toward them when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh ill-natured and fierce of heart brutish and coarse towards them they would have dispersed split away from about you. So pardon them pass over what they have done and ask forgiveness for them for their sins until I forgive them and consult them find out their opinions in the matter that is your affair in the battle and otherwise in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated in this respect; and indeed the Prophet s would frequently consult them. And when you are resolved to carry out what you wish after counsel rely on God put your trust in Him and not in any counsel; for God loves those who rely on Him."
