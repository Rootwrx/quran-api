  "text": "And hold fast to clutch God’s bond namely His religion together and do not scatter after submitting to Islam; remember God’s grace His bestowing of favours upon you O companies of the Aws and the Khazraj when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together through Islam so that by His grace you became brothers in religion and comradeship; and you were upon the brink the edge of a pit of fire such that to fall into it you only had to die disbelieving; but He delivered you from it through belief. So just as He has made clear for you what has been mentioned God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided."
