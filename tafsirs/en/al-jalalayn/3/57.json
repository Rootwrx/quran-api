  "text": "But as for the believers who do righteous deeds He will pay them in full yuwaffīhim is also read nuwaffīhim ‘We will pay them in full’ their wages. God loves not the evildoers that is He will chastise them. It is reported that God exalted be He sent him Jesus a cloud which raised him up but his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her ‘Verily the Resurrection shall bring us together again’. This took place on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr in the Holy House of Jerusalem when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim narrate a hadīth in which it is stated that he Jesus will descend when the Hour is nigh and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet Muhammad and that he will slay the false messiah and the swine break the cross and impose the jizya. In a hadīth recorded by Muslim he will remain for seven years; according to Abū Dāwūd al-Tayālisī he will remain for forty years and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant by the forty years is the total time he will have spent on earth before he was raised and afterwards."
