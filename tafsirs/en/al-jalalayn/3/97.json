  "text": "Therein are clear signs among which is the station of Abraham that is the stone upon which he stood to build the House and on which his footprints remain; and it the House has endured all this length of time and the constant passing of hands over it. Among these signs are the fact that the reward for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt as two variants of the verbal noun from hajj meaning ‘the intention to journey there’ if he is able to make his way there man istatā‘a ilayhi sabīlan substitutes for al-nās ‘people’. The Prophet s explained this ability as having provisions and a ride as reported by al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī and others. As for the one who disbelieves in God or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage God is Independent of all worlds the humans the jinn and the angels and is Independent of their devotions."
