  "text": "And mention when God made covenant with those who had been given the Scripture that is the pledge taken from them in the Torah ‘You shall expound it read tubayyinunnahu or yubayyinunnahu ‘they shall expound it’ the Book to people and not conceal it’ read taktumūnahu ‘you shall not conceal it’ or yaktumūnahu ‘they shall not conceal it’. But they rejected it they discarded the covenant behind their backs and so they did not act in accordance with it and bought with it they took in its place a small price of this world from the debased among them enjoying supremacy over them in knowledge and they concealed it lest it the supremacy escape them; how evil is what they have bought how evil is this purchase of theirs!"
