Thus he made lawful for them fish and birds which had no spikes; it is also said that he made it all lawful for them so that ba‘d ‘some’ means kull ‘all’. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord He has repeated it for emphasis and to expand upon it so fear God and obey me in what I command you of affirming God’s Oneness and being obedient to Him."
