  "text": "It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God by His decree a prescribed kitāban here a verbal noun that is God has prescribed this term that is to say a term fixed in time neither brought forward nor deferred so why did you retreat in defeat? Defeat does not ward off death nor does standing one’s ground sever life. And whoever desires by his deeds the reward of this world that is his requital in it We will give him of it what has been alloted to him but he shall have no share in the Hereafter; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter We will give him of it that is of its reward; and We will requite the thankful."
