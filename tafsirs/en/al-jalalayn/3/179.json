And it is not God’s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the others before the distinguishing; but God chooses He selects of His messengers whom He will apprising him of some of His Unseen as when He apprised the Prophet s of the position of the hypocrites. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against hypocrisy then yours shall be a great wage."
