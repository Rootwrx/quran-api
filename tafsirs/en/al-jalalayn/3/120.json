  "text": "If good fortune a favour such as victory or booty befalls you it is evil for them it grieves them; but if evil such as defeat or drought befalls you they rejoice thereat the conditional statement here is semantically connected to the previous conditional and what comes in between is a parenthetical statement the meaning being that their enmity towards you is endless so why do you befriend them? Avoid them! Yet if you endure their harm and fear God by not befriending them and so on their guile will not hurt you read either lā yadirkum or lā yadurrukum at all; God encompasses what they do ya‘malūn or may be read ta‘malūn ‘what you do’ He has knowledge of it and will requite them for it."
