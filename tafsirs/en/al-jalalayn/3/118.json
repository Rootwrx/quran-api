  "text": "O you who believe do not take as intimates as sincere friends revealing to them your secret thoughts anyone apart from yourselves from among the Jews Christians and the hypocrites; such men spare nothing to ruin you khabālan is in the accusative because the preposition that usually precedes it sc. fī’l-khabāl has been omitted that is to say they would not be remiss about corrupting you; they would love they wish for you to suffer al-‘anat means extreme hardship. Hatred enmity towards you is revealed it is manifested by their mouths by sowing discord among you and informing the idolaters of your secret plans; and what their breasts conceal of enmity is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs of their enmity; if you understand this then do not befriend them."
