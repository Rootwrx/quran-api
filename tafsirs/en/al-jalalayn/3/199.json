Salām and his companions and the Negus and what has been revealed to you that is the Qur’ān and what has been revealed to them that is the Torah and the Gospel humble before God khāshi‘īn is a circumstantial qualification of the person of the verb yu’min ‘who believe’ and takes into account the potentially plural sense of man ‘who’ not purchasing with the verses of God which they have before them in the Torah and the Gospel pertaining to the descriptions of the Prophet s a small price of this world by concealing them for fear of losing their supremacy as others like the Jews have done. Those — their wage the reward for their deeds is with their Lord a reward which they will be given twice over as stated in the sūrat al-Qasas Q. 2854. God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in about half a day of the days of this world."
