  "text": "When the Jews said to the Prophet ‘You claim that you follow the creed of Abraham but Abraham did not eat camel’s meat nor drink its milk’ the following was revealed All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel Jacob forbade for himself namely camels when he was afflicted with sciatica ‘irq al-nasā he made a vow that if he were cured he would not eat of it again and so it was forbidden him; before the Torah was revealed which was after the time of Abraham as it was not unlawful in his time as they claimed. Say to them ‘Bring the Torah now and recite it so that the truth of what you say may become clear if you are truthful’ in what you say; they were stupified and did not bring it the Torah. God exalted be He then said"
