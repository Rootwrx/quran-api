  "text": "When idh substitutes for the previous idh two parties of you the Banū Salima and the Banū Hāritha the two flanks of the army were about to lose heart about to shrink from the battle and retreat after ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions began to retreat. He Ibn Ubayy said ‘Why should we get ourselves and our children killed?’ and he also said to Abū Jābir al-Salamī — who had said to him ‘I implore you by God for your Prophet’s sake and yours’ — ‘If we knew how to fight we would follow you!’ But God then made them the Banū Salima and the Banū Hāritha steadfast and they did not abandon the field; and God was their Protector their Helper and let the believers rely on God let them place their trust in Him and none other."
