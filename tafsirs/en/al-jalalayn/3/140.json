Such days We deal out in turn We dispense them among mankind one day for one group the next day for another that they might be admonished and that God may know through knowledge manifested outwardly those who believe who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses from among you honouring them with martyrdom and God loves not the evildoers the disbelievers that is He will chastise them and the blessings He bestows upon them are only a means of drawing out their punishment."
