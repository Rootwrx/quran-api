For those that are fearful of idolatry with their Lord ‘inda rabbihim is the predicate the subject being the following jannātun…’ are Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein decreed for them therein is eternal life when they enter it and spouses purified of menstruation and other impurities and beatitude read ridwān or rudwān meaning ‘much pleasure’ from God; and God is Seer knower of His servants requiting each of them according to his deeds."
