When Umm Salama asked ‘O Messenger of God why is there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration hijra?’ the following was revealed and those who emigrated from Mecca to Medina and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in My way for My religion and fought the disbelievers and were slain read qutilū or quttilū — them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds concealing these with forgiveness and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow’.
