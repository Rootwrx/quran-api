  "text": "That which has been mentioned of the matter of Zachariah and Mary is of the tidings of the Unseen of the news of what was unknown to you. We reveal it to you O Muhammad (s) for you were not with them when they were casting quills in the water drawing their lots so that it be manifested to them which of them should have charge of which of them should bring up Mary; nor were you with them when they were disputing about the custodianship of Mary such that you might have known it and related it; but truly you know it only through revelation."
