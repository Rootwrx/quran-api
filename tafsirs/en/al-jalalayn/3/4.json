  "text": "before that is to say before revealing it the Qur’ān as guidance hudan a circumstantial qualifier meaning hādiyīn ‘guides from error’ to people to those who followed these two Books He uses the word anzala for the revelation of these two and nazzala for that of the Qur’ān for the latter entails repetition whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance; and He revealed the Criterion al-furqān meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this Criterion after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all revealed Scriptures besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God’s signs the Qur’ān or any other revelation for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty victorious in His affair so that nothing can prevent Him from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution with a severe punishment for those that disobeyed Him the like of which none can do."
