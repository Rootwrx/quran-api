And keep them company in this world honourably in other words with decency dutifulness and kindness — and follow the way of him who returns to Me in penitence with acts of obedience. Then to Me will be your return and I will inform you of what you used to do and requite you for it the entire sentence containing the ‘enjoinder’ verse 14 and what comes after it constitutes a parenthetical statement."
