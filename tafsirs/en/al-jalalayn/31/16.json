Even if it namely the evil trait should be the weight of a grain of mustard-seed and even if it be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth in other words in the most concealed place therein God will bring it forth and He will call that person to account for it. Truly God is Subtle in bringing it forth Aware of its location."
