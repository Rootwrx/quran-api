God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour when it will come to pass; and He sends down read yunzilu or yunazzilu the rain at times which only He knows; and He knows what is in the wombs whether it is a male or a female; and not one of the three things is known by anyone other than God exalted be He. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow of good or evil but God exalted be He knows this; and no soul knows in what land it will die but God exalted be He knows this. Truly God is Knower of all things Aware of the inward and outward aspects thereof. Al-Bukhārī reported by way of an isnād from ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Umar the following hadīth ‘The Keys of the Unseen are five Lo! God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour … to the end of the sūra’ above."
