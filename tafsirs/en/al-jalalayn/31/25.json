  "text": "And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God’ la-yaqūlunna ‘they will surely say’ the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the like sc. the nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw of the plural person because of two unvocalised consonants coming together. Say ‘Praise be to God’ for the manifestation of the definitive argument against them by the affirmation of the Oneness of God. Nay but most of them do not realise that this affirmation is an obligation upon them."
