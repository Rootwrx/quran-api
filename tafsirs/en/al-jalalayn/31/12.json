  "text": "And verily We gave Luqmān wisdom comprising knowledge religiousness and right-mindedness in speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions in matters of religion before David was summoned to prophethood but lived on into the latter’s summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him David and refrained from giving any more legal opinions explaining this thus ‘Should I not be content if someone like the prophet David has spared me the trouble?’ He was once asked ‘What is the worst kind of person?’ He said ‘The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil’. In other words We gave him wisdom and We said to him ‘Give thanks to God for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his gratitude shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for a grace then surely God is Independent without need of His creation Praised’ in what He does."
