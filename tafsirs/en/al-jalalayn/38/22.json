  "text": "When they entered upon David and he was frightened by them. And they said ‘Do not fear; we are two disputants some say that this means ‘two groups’ in order to agree with the plural person of the verb dakhalū ‘they entered’; others say ‘two individuals’ with the plural person actually denoting these two; al-khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the form of two disputants between whom there was supposed to have occurred the situation mentioned — but only hypothetically — in order to alert David peace be upon him to what he had done he had ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He David had married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the rights of the other so judge justly between us and do not transgress do not be unjust and guide us direct us to the right path’ the correct way."
