  "text": "And We said to him ‘Take in your hand a bunch of twigs or some blades of grass and smite therewith your wife — for he had sworn to smite her a hundred times on one occasion when she was late in coming to him — and do not break your oath’ by not smiting her so he took a hundred rushes and smote her with them once and that sufficed to fulfil his oath. Truly We found him to be steadfast. What an excellent servant! was Job. Indeed he was a penitent soul always returning to God exalted be He."
