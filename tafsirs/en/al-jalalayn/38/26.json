  "text": "‘O David! We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth managing the affairs of people; so judge justly between people and do not follow desire that is the desires of the soul that it then lead you astray from the way of God that is to say from the proofs that indicate the truth of His Oneness. Truly those who go astray from the way of God in other words from belief in God — for them there will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning’ as a result of their having neglected faith. For had they been certain of the truth of the Day of Reckoning they would have first been believers in this world."
