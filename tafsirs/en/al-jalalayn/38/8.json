  "text": "Has the Remembrance the Qur’ān been revealed to him Muhammad (s) out of all of us’ when he is neither the elder nor the noblest among us? In other words it could not have been revealed to him read a-unzila pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or without this insertion. God exalted be He says Nay but they are in doubt concerning My Remembrance My revelation that is the Qur’ān for they deny the one who has brought it. Nay but they have not yet tasted My chastisement and if they were to taste it they would certainly believe the Prophet s in what he has brought — but then in such a case their belief in the Prophet would be of no benefit to them."
