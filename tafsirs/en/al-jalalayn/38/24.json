  "text": "He said ‘He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. And indeed many associates infringe upon the rights of one another except such as believe and perform righteous deeds but few are they!’ mā emphasises the ‘fewness’. As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other ‘He has certainly passed judgement on himself!’ David was thus alerted to his deed.

So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented."
