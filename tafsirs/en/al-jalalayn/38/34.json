  "text": "And We certainly tried Solomon We tested him by wresting his kingdom from him because he had married a woman solely out of his desire for her. She used to worship idols in his own home without his knowledge. Now control of his kingdom lay in his ring. On one occasion needing to withdraw to relieve himself he took it off and left it with this woman of his whose name was al-Amīna as was his custom; but a jinn disguised in the form of Solomon came to her and seized it from her. And We cast upon his throne a lifeless body which was that very jinn and he was the one known as Sakhr — or it was some other jinn; he sat upon Solomon’s throne and so as was the case with Solomon the birds and other creatures devoted themselves to him in service. When Solomon came out of his palace having seen him the jinn upon his throne he said to the people ‘I am Solomon not him!’ But they did not recognise him. Then he repented — Solomon returned to his kingdom many days later after he had managed to acquire the ring. He wore it and sat upon his throne again."
