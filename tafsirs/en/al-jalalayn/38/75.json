This in itself is an honour for Adam as God has Himself undertaken the unmediated creation of all creatures. Are you being arrogant now in refraining from prostrating an interrogative meant as a rebuke; or are you of the exalted?’ of the proud and have therefore disdained to prostrate yourself because you are one of them?"
