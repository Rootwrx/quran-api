Luhayy; then they differed some of them remaining firmly upon belief in One God while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from your Lord to the effect that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection it would have been decided between them that is between mankind in this life regarding that over which they differed in religion by the disbelievers being punished."
