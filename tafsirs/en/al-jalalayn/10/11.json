  "text": "When the idolaters sought to hasten their chastisement the following was revealed And if God should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good their term of life would already have been concluded for them read as the passive with nominative ajaluhum sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum; or read as the active with accusative ajalahum sc. la-qadā ajalahum ‘He would have already concluded their term’ by His destroying them but He gives them respite. But We leave those who do not expect to encounter Us to wander blindly in their insolence hesistant and perplexed."
