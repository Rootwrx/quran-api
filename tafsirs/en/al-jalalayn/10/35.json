  "text": "Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that guides to the truth?’ by means of setting up definitive arguments and creating guidance. Say ‘God guides to the truth; is One Who guides to the truth — and this is God — more deserving of being followed or one who does not guide one who is not himself guided unless he is guided? more deserving of being followed? the interrogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke in other words the former is more deserving. So what is wrong with you how do you judge?’ how do you make this corrupt judgement one where what does not deserve to be followed is followed?"
