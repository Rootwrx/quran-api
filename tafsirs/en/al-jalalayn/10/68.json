God exalted be He says to them Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcending having offspring. He is Independent without need of anyone for only he who has need of a child would desire to have one. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth as possessions creatures and servants. You have no warrant no proof for this that you say. Do you say about God what you do not know? an interrogative meant as a rebuke."
