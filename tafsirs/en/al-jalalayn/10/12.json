  "text": "If misfortune illness or poverty should befall a disbelieving man he calls upon Us on his side that is lying down or sitting or standing in other words in every state; but when We have relieved him of his misfortune he passes on in his unbelief as if ka-an is softened its subject omitted in other words read as ka-annahu he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So in the same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention from supplication in times of comfort were adorned for him is adorned for the prodigal the idolaters that which they do."
