  "text": "And you O Muhammad (s) are not occupied with any business any matter nor do you recite anything regarding it that is regarding such a matter — or it means nor do you recite anything from God by way of the Qur’ān which He has revealed to you nor do you perform any action God is addressing him and his community but We are witnesses watchers over you when you are engaged therein that is in the action. And not so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant in the earth or in the heaven escapes is hidden from your Lord nor what is less than that or greater but it is in a clear a manifest Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
