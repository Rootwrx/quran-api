Then say to them ‘The Unseen that which is concealed from servants in other words its affair belongs only to God and it is from this Unseen that signs come forth; therefore He alone can bring them forth mine is only to covey the Message. So wait for the chastisement if you do not believe. I am waiting with you’."
