  "text": "And when Our clear manifest bayyināt is a circumstantial qualifier verses from the Qur’ān are recited to them those who do not expect to encounter Us those who do not fear the Resurrection say ‘Bring a Qur’ān other than this one in which our gods are not denigrated or change it’ of your own accord. Say to them ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed to me. Truly I fear if I should disobey my Lord by changing it the chastisement of a dreadful day’ that is the Day of Resurrection."
