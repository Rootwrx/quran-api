Truly He read innahu as a new sentence or annahu with an implied lām sc. li-annahu ‘Because He’ originates creation that is He began it by originating it then recreates it through resurrection that He may requite reward those who believe and perform righteous deeds justly. And those who disbelieve for them will be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved."
