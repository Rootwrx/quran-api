  "text": "Say ‘Have you considered? Say inform me If His God’s chastisement comes upon you by night or day what part is there of it that is of the chastisement that the sinners the idolaters seek to hasten? an overt noun al-mujrimūn ‘the sinners’ has replaced the second person ‘you’ pronominalisation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional as in the case where you might say ‘If I come to you what would you give me?’; the intention here is to provoke terror in them in other words how awful is that which they seek to hasten!"
