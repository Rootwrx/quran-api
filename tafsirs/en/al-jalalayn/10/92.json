  "text": "But this day We shall save you We shall bring you out of the sea in your body your lifeless corpse that you may be for those after you a sign a lesson that they might come to know your servitude and not venture upon deeds like yours. According to Ibn ‘Abbās some of the Children of Israel doubted his death and so he was brought out of the sea for them to see. And truly most people that is the people of Mecca are heedless of Our signs’ not learning the lesson therefrom."
