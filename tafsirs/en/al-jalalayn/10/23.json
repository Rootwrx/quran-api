O mankind your insolence wrongdoing is only against yourselves since the sin thereof shall fall against them; it is but the enjoyment of the life of this world which you will enjoy for a short while then to Us is your return after death and We shall inform you of what you used to do and then requite you for it a variant reading for nominative matā‘u has accusative matā‘a ‘an enjoyment’ in other words read as with an omitted verb such as tatamatta‘ūna ‘one which you shall enjoy’."
