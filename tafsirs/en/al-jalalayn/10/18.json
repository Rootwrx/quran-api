  "text": "And they worship besides God that is other than Him that which can neither hurt them should they not worship it nor profit them if they do worship it — and these are the idols; and they say of them ‘These are our intercessors with God’. Say to them ‘Would you tell would you inform God of what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?’ the interrogative is meant as a disavowal for if He had a partner He Himself would know it since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcendence and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him."
