Say ‘Then bring a sūra like it in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language by way of invention for you are eloquent speakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can for help in this matter besides God that is other than Him if you are truthful’ in saying that this is an invention.
