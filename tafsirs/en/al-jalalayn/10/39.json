  "text": "God exalted be He says Nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they did not comprehend that is they denied the Qur’ān and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation the consequence of the threats made therein has not yet come to them. So in the same manner of denial those who were before them denied their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers! for denying the messengers in other words behold how their affair was concluded by their being destroyed. In a similar manner We shall destroy these people."
