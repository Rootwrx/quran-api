  "text": "That chastisement in this world is because bi-annahu contains the pronoun of the matter their messengers used to bring them clear signs manifest proofs for the validity of faith but they said ‘Shall mere humans basharan is meant as generic be our guides?’ So they disbelieved and turned away from faith and God was independent without need of their faith. And God is Independent without need of His creatures Praised praiseworthy in His actions."
