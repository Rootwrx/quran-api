Indeed among your wives and children there are enemies for you so beware of them of obeying them in neglecting the performance of good deeds such as struggling or emigrating â€” because the reason why this verse was revealed was precisely their obedience of them in such matters. And if you pardon them for their impeding you from such good deeds justifying it on account of the distress that parting with you causes them and overlook such enmity and forgive then assuredly God is Forgiving Merciful."
