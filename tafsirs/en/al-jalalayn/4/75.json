  "text": "What is wrong with you that you do not fight this is an interrogative of rebuke in other words there is nothing to prevent you from fighting in the way of God and for the deliverance of the oppressed men women and children whom the disbelievers persecuted and prevented from emigrating. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with him and his father said ‘My mother and I were among them’; who say supplicating ‘O our Lord bring us forth from this town Mecca whose people are evildoers through unbelief and appoint for us a protector from You to take charge of our affair and appoint for us from You a helper’ to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated escape for some of them while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered — in charge of them the Prophet s placed ‘Attāb b. Asīd who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had wronged them."
