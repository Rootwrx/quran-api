  "text": "As for those of your women who commit lewdness adultery call four Muslim men of you to witness against them; and if they witness against them such lewdness then detain them in their houses and prevent them from mixing with people until the angels of death take them or until God appoints for them a way out of it. This was stipulated for them at the very beginning of Islam but then a way out was appointed for them through the stipulation that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year and the married woman be stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus in the hadīth ‘Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them’ as reported by Muslim."
