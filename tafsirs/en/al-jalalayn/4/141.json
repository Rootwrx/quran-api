So give us from the booty; but if the disbelievers have some luck by gaining a victory over you they say to them ‘Did we not gain mastery authority over you capable of capturing you and slaying you but we spared you and did we not defend you against the believers?’ lest they be victorious over you by forsaking them and apprising you of their plans and thus have we not done you a favour? God exalted be He says God will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection admitting you into Paradise and them into the Fire; and God will never grant the disbelievers a way a means to success over the believers by annihilating them."
