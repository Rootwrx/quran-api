Surely God keeps count of He holds you accountable for all things and requites accordingly including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever an innovator a wicked person and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself or one in the bath or one eating — indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever who says ‘peace be upon you’ one should simply say ‘And upon you’."
