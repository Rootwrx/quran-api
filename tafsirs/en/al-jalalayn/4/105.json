When it was discovered with the latter Tu‘ma accused him of having stolen it and swore by God that he Tu‘ma had not stolen it and his clan asked the Prophet s to advocate on his behalf and absolve him whereupon the following was revealed Surely We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors like Tu‘ma disputing on their behalf."
