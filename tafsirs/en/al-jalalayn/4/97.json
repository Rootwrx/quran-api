  "text": "The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emigrate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers And those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging their souls having remained among the disbelievers and neglected to emigrate the angels will say to them in rebuke ‘What was your predicament?’ in other words ‘in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion’. They will say giving excuses ‘We were oppressed unable to establish religion in the land’ the land of Mecca. The angels will say to them in rebuke ‘But was not God’s earth spacious that you might have emigrated therein?’ from the land of unbelief to another land as others did? God exalted be He says as for such their abode shall be Hell — an evil journey’s end it is!"
