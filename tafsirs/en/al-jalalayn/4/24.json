Lawful for you read passive wa-uhilla or active wa-ahalla beyond all that that is except what He has forbidden you of women is that you seek women using your wealth by way of a dowry or a price in wedlock and not fornicating in illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby and have had sexual intercourse with give them their wages the dowries that you have assigned them as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together you and they after the obligation is waived decreased or increased. God is ever Knowing of His creatures Wise in what He has ordained for them."
