  "text": "O you who believe obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you that is rulers when they command you to obey God and His Messenger. If you should quarrel disagree about anything refer it to God that is to His Book and the Messenger while he lives and thereafter refer to his Sunna in other words examine these disputes with reference to these two sources if you believe in God and the Last Day; that reference to the two sources is better for you than quarrelling or adhering to personal opinions and more excellent in interpretation in the end."
