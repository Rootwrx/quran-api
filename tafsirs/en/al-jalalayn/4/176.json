  "text": "They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning indirect heirs. Say ‘God pronounces to you concerning indirect heirs. If a man in imru’un is in the nominative because of the verb halaka ‘perishes’ that explains it perishes dies having no children and no parent and this is the one referred to as an indirect heir kalāla but he has a sister from both parents or from one hers is half of what he leaves and he a brother similarly is her heir in all that she leaves if she has no children but if she has a son then he the maternal uncle receives nothing and if a daughter then whatever is left after her share; if the brother and sister be from the same mother then the one receives a sixth as was stipulated at the beginning of the sūra Q. 411. If there be two sisters or more — for this was revealed regarding Jābir b. ‘Abd Allāh who died and was survived by sisters — theirs are two-thirds of what he the brother leaves; if there be among the inheritors siblings men and women then the male among them shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you the stipulations of your religion lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things’ including matters of inheritance it is reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim that al-Barā’ b. ‘Āzib said that this was the last of the ‘duty’ verses to be revealed."
