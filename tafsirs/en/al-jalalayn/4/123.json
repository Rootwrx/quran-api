  "text": "When the Muslims and the People of the Scripture began to pride themselves upon God’s promise the following was revealed It this matter is not dependent upon your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations as is stated in hadīth; and he will not find besides God that is other than Him any friend to protect him or helper to defend him against Him."
