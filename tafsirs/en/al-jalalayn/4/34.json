Therefore righteous women among them are obedient to their husbands guarding in the unseen that is guarding their private parts and otherwise during their spousesâ€™ absence because of what God has guarded for them when He enjoined their male spouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious disobedient to you when such signs appear admonish them make them fear God and share not beds with them retire to other beds if they manifest such disobedience and strike them but not violently if they refuse to desist from their rebellion after leaving them in separate beds. If they then obey you in what is desired from them do not seek a way against them a reason to strike them unjustly. God is ever High Great so beware of Him lest He punish you for treating them unjustly."
