  "text": "O People of the Scripture the Gospel do not go to extremes do not go beyond the bounds in your religion and do not say about God except the saying of the truth such as exalting Him above any associations with a partner or a child the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary was only the Messenger of God and His Word which He cast to which He conveyed to Mary and a spirit that is one whose spirit is from Him he Jesus is here attached to God exalted be He as an honouring for him and not as you claim that he is the son of God or a god alongside Him or one of three because one that possesses a spirit is compound while God transcends being compound and the attribution of compounds to Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say that the gods are ‘Three’ God Jesus and his mother. Refrain from this and say what it is better for you to say which is the profession of His Oneness. Verily God is but One God. Glory be to Him transcending the possibility that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and such sovereignty is not compatible with that prophethood of Jesus. God suffices as a Guardian a Witness to this."
