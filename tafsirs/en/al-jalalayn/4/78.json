  "text": "Wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raised-up lofty towers’ forts so do not shrink from fighting for fear of death. And if a good thing such as fertility and abundance befalls them the Jews they say ‘This is from God’; but if an evil thing such as drought or misfortune befalls them as it did with them when the Prophet s arrived in Medina they say ‘This is from you’ O Muhammad (s) that is from the bad luck you bring. Say to them ‘Everything good and evil is from God.’ What is wrong with this people that they do not understand that is they do not come close to comprehending any words delivered to them the mā ‘what’ of mā li-hā’ūlā’ ‘what is wrong with these’ is an interrogative intended to provoke amazement at their extreme ignorance; to state that one cannot even come close to doing something is rhetorically more intense than saying that he cannot do it."
