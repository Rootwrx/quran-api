  "text": "Those who alladhīna is either a substitution for or an adjectival qualification of al-munāfiqīna ‘the hypocrites’ take disbelievers for friends instead of believers because they mistakenly believe them to be strong — do they desire do they seek power with them? an interrogative of disavowal that is to say they shall not find such power with them. Truly power belongs altogether to God in this world and the Hereafter and none but His friends shall attain it."
