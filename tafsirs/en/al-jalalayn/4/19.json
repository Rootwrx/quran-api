  "text": "O you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will read either karhan or kurhan as alternative forms that is to say coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times they used to inherit women from their kin and if they so wished they could marry a woman without a dowry or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves or prevent her from marriage until she gave up what she had inherited or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them your former wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them of the dowry except when they commit flagrant read mubayyina ‘making it clear’ or mubayyana ‘clear’ lewdness such as adultery or rebellion then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit their dowries. Consort with them in kindness that is being decent in speaking to them with regard to their expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good that is to say perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them."
