  "text": "And when the division of the inheritance is attended by kinsmen those of kinship who cannot inherit and orphans and the poor grant them something out of it before the division is effected; and if the inheritors are young speak to them O guardians honourable words kindly by apologising to them that it is not your possession to divide as you wish but that it is for the young inheritors. Some say that this stipulation was abrogated; others say that it was not only that people were all too readily neglecting it since it was encouraged but not prescribed. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is a duty."
