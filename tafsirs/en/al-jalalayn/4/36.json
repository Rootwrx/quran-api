  "text": "And worship God declare His Oneness and associate nothing with Him. Be kind to parents being dutiful and gentle-mannered and near kindred and to orphans and to the needy and to the neighbour who is near to you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship and to the neighbour who is a stranger the one far from you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship; and to the friend at your side a travelling companion or a colleague at work and it is also said oneâ€™s wife; and to the wayfarer the one cut off during a journey and to what your right hands own of bondsmen. Surely God loves not the conceited the arrogant and the boastful the one who boasts before people of what he has been given."
