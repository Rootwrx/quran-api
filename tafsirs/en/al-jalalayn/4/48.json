But He forgives other than save that of sins to whomever He wills forgiveness for by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God then he has indeed invented a tremendous a great sin."
