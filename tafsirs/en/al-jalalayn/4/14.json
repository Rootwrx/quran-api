  "text": "But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds him He will admit read in both ways as above yudkhilhu and nudkhilhu to a Fire abiding therein and for him in it there shall be a humbling chastisement one of humiliation. In both of the last verses the singular person of the suffixed pronouns and the verbs accords with the singular form of the particle man ‘whoever’ while the plural person in khālidīn ‘abiding’ accords with its general plural import."
