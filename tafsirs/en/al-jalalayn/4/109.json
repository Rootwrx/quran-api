There you are addressing Tu‘ma’s clan you have contested you have disputed on their behalf that is to say on behalf of Tu‘ma and his men a variant reading has ‘anhu ‘on his behalf’ in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection if He were to punish them or who will be a guardian for them and take charge of their affair or defend them? In other words no one will do such a thing."
