  "text": "And when there comes to them an issue news concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet s and what has happened to them be it of security through victory or of fear through defeat they broadcast it they make it widely-known this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites or from among the feeble believers who used to do this and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet s would become distressed. If they had referred it the news to the Messenger and to those in authority among them that is the judicious elders among the Companions in other words if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out those who follow it up and seek knowledge of it the ones who broadcast it would have known it and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not from them from the Prophet s and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you through Islam and His mercy to you through the Qur’ān you would surely have followed Satan in the abominations to which he commands you except a few of you."
