  "text": "So fight O Muhammad (s) in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself so do not be concerned with their failing to join you the meaning being fight even if you are on your own for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might the war of the disbelievers; God is mightier than them and more severe in castigation in punishment than them. And so the Messenger of God s said ‘By Him in Whose Hand is my soul I shall sally forth to fight even if I go alone’. Thereupon he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first battle at Badr where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abū Sufyān from sallying forth as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3151."
