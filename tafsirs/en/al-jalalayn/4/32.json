  "text": "Do not covet that in which God has preferred some of you above others in the way of worldly affairs or religion lest it lead to mutual envy and hatred. To men a share from a reward for what they have earned for their acts in the struggle and so on and to women a share from what they have earned by way of being obedient to their spouses and guarding their private parts this was revealed when Umm Salama said ‘Would that we were men so that we could join the struggle and receive the reward they receive!’ And ask read wa-s’alū or wa-salū God of His bounty what you need and He will give it to you; God is ever Knower of all things including where merit is deserved and that for which you ask."
