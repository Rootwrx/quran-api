  "text": "The People of the Scripture the Jews will ask of you O Muhammad (s) to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven all at once as was revealed to Moses merely to harass you. If you consider this shocking then know that they their forefathers asked Moses for something greater than that for they said ‘Show us God openly’ before our eyes; so the thunderbolt death seized them as punishment for them for their evildoing when they harassed him Moses with this demand. They then took to themselves the golden calf for a god after clear proofs the miracles testifying to God’s Oneness had come to them; yet We pardoned that and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority evident and manifest sway over them for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance they obeyed him."
