  "text": "You will find others desiring to have security from you by manifesting belief before you and security from their own people through unbelief when they return to them and these were the tribes of Asad and GhatafƒÅn; yet whenever they are returned to sedition whenever they are summoned to idolatry they are overwhelmed by it falling into it in the worst of ways. So if they do not stay away from you by refraining from fighting you and do not offer you peace and do not restrain their hands from you then take them as captives and slay them wherever you come upon them wherever you find them; against them We have given you clear warrant a clear and manifest proof for you to slay them and capture them on account of their treachery."
