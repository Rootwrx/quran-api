  "text": "When a group retreated from Uhud people were at variance over their status. Some said ‘Let us slay them’ while others said ‘No!’ So the following was revealed What is wrong with you what is the matter with you that you have become two parties two groups regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them He has turned them back to disbelief for what they earned? in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray? that is to count them among the guided the interrogative in both places is for disapproval. And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path to guidance."
