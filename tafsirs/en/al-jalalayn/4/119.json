  "text": "And I will surely lead them astray from truth with evil whisperings and surely I will fill them with desires I shall cast into their hearts thoughts that life will endure that there will be no resurrection and no reckoning; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle’s ears and this was done to the she-camels they called bahā’ir. And surely I will command them and they will change God’s creation’ substituting His religion with unbelief making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron following him and obeying him instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss one that is evident since he will end up in the Fire made perpetual for him."
