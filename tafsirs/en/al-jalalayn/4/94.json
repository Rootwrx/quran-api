  "text": "The following was revealed when a group from among the Companions passed by a man from the Banū Sulaym driving his flock of sheep and he offered them a greeting of peace. But they said ‘He only greeted us dissimulating out of fear’. So they killed him and took away his flock O you who believe when you are going forth travelling in order to struggle in the way of God be discriminating fa-tabayyanū; a variant reading has fa-tathabbatū ‘ascertain’ here and further below; and do not say to him who offers you peace read al-salām or al-salam that is the greeting or offers you submission declaring the profession of faith shahāda which is an indication of being a Muslim ‘You are not a believer you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property’ so that you then end up killing him desiring seeking by this the transient goods of the life of this world that is its enjoyment in the way of spoils. With God are plenteous spoils rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for his property. So you were formerly when your lives and property were protected simply upon your professing the faith; but God has been gracious to you making you known for your faith and uprightness. So be discriminating lest you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated formerly. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do and will requite you for it."
