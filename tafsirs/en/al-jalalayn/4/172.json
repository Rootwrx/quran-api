  "text": "The Messiah whom you claim is a god would never disdain would never scorn or reject haughtily to be a servant of God neither would the angels who are nigh to God disdain to be servants this is a splendid digression to the matter of the angels and it is mentioned as a refutation of those who claim that they the angels are gods or the daughters of God just as He refuted with what was stated before the Christians who claim that which is the subject of the address to them above. Whoever disdains to worship Him and waxes proud He will assuredly muster them to Him all of them in the Hereafter."
