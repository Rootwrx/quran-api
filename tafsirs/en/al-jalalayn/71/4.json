  "text": "that He may forgive you some of your sins min dhunūbikum ‘some of your sins’ min may be taken as extra because submission to God islām expunges everything of sin that was committed previous to it; or it min may be understood as partitive to point out that which is due to those who were already God’s servants and defer you without chastising you until an appointed term the term for death. Indeed when God’s term for your chastisement — should you not believe — comes it cannot be deferred if only you knew’ this you would believe."
