  "text": "But the council of his people who disbelieved said to their followers ‘This is just a human being like you who desires to gain superiority to have the honour over you by acquiring followers you being his followers. And had God willed that none other than Him be worshipped He would have sent down angels with that Message and not assigned a human being for it. We never heard of such an affirmation of God’s Oneness as that which Noah summons us among our forefathers among past communities."
