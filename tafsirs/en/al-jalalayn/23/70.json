  "text": "Or do they say ‘There is a madness in him’? — this interrogative is meant as an affirmation of the truth of the Prophet’s sincerity and of the fact that messengers did come to past communities and of the fact that they do indeed recognise their Messenger to be truthful and trustworthy and of the fact that there is no madness in him. Nay bal is for transition he has brought them the truth namely the Qur’ān that comprises affirmations of the Oneness of God and the Laws of Islam; but most of them are averse to the truth."
