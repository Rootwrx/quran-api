  "text": "that I might act righteously by witnessing that ‘there is no god but God’ that this might be in that which I have left behind’ in what I have wasted of my life in other words that this affirmation might be in its place. God exalted be He says By no means! that is there shall be no return. It namely the statement ‘My Lord! Send me back’ is merely a word that he speaks but a word in which there is no benefit for him; and behind them ahead of them there is a barrier which prevents them from going back to this world until the day when they are raised after which day there will be no more return."
