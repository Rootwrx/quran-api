Then We transformed the clot into a little lump of flesh mudgha a piece of flesh about the size of what one would be able to chew mā yumdagh. Then We transformed the lump of flesh into bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh a variant reading in both instances instead of the plurals ‘izāman and al-‘izāma ‘the bones’ is singular ‘azman and ‘al-‘azma ‘the bone’; and in all three instances above khalaqnā means ‘We made it become’ as opposed to ‘We created’. Then We produced him as yet another creature by breathing into him Our Spirit. So blessed be God the best of creators! that is the best of determiners the specificier noun for ahsana ‘the best’ has been omitted because it is obvious khalqan ‘in terms of creation’."
