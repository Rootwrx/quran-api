  "text": "And if the truth namely the Qur’ān had followed their desires and come to them with mention of what they fancied in the way of God having a partner and a child may God be exalted above such associations indeed the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been corrupted they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because contradictions would ensue as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler. Nay We have brought them their Remembrance namely the Qur’ān in which they are remembered and honoured but they are disregardful of their own Remembrance."
