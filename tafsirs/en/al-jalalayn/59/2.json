  "text": "It is He Who expelled those who disbelieved of the People of the Scripture namely the Jews of the Banū al-Nadīr from their homelands from their dwellings at Medina at the first exile that is their exile to Syria the last exile being their banishment to Khaybar by ‘Umar during his caliphate. You did not think O believers that they would go forth and they thought that they would be protected māni‘atuhum is the predicate of an ‘that’ by their fortresses husūnuhum the agent of the verb māni‘atuhum with which the predication is completed from God from His chastisement. But God His command and His chastisement came at them from whence they had not reckoned from whence had never occurred to them from the part of the believers and He cast terror ru‘b or ru‘ub into their hearts by having their chief Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf slain destroying as they did read yukharribūna; or yukhribūna derived from 4th form akhraba their houses in order to take away with them what they valued of wood and so on with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed O you who have eyes!"
