And We have made some of you a trial for others a test trying the rich with the poor the healthy with the sick the honourable with the vulgar in each case the latter would say ‘Why can I not be like the other person?’ Will you be steadfast? and endure what you hear from those with whom you are tried? the interrogative is meant as an imperative in other words ‘Be steadfast!’. And your Lord is ever Watchful of those who remain steadfast and those who become miserable."
