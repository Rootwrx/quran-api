This was the principal town of the towns inhabited by the people of Lot; God destroyed its inhabitants for their committing acts of lewdness. Can it be that they have not seen it? on their journeys to Syria and so take heed thereof? the interrogative is affirmative. Nay but it is that they do not expect they have no fear of any resurrection and so they do not believe."
