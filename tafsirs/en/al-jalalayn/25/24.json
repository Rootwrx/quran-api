  "text": "Those who will be the inhabitants of Paradise on that day the Day of Resurrection will be in a far better abode than are the disbelievers in this world and a far better resting place than theirs the latter’s; in other words a better place for qā’ila which is a rest taken during midday during hot days. From this last interpretation of maqīlan it has been inferred that the Reckoning will be concluded in half a day as is stated in one hadīth."
