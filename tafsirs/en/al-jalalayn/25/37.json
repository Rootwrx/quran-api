  "text": "And mention the people of Noah when they denied the messengers in denying Noah — it is as though he were many messengers given the length of time he remained among them; or it is thus expressed in the plural because to deny him is equivalent to denying all the other messengers for they all came with the same Message concerning affirmation of God’s Oneness — We drowned them this is the response to lammā ‘when’ and made them a sign a lesson for mankind thereafter and We have prepared in the Hereafter for the evildoers the disbelievers a painful chastisement in addition to what chastisement may befall them in this world."
