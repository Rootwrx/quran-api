They will then say ‘Who shall bring us back?’ to life. Say ‘He Who originated you created you the first time when you had not been anything in existence because the One Who is able to initiate creation is also able to repeat it indeed this repetition is easier than the initiation. Then they will shake their heads at you stupefied and they will say mockingly ‘When will it be?’ that is the Resurrection. Say ‘Maybe it is near!’"
