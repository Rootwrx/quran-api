And there is not a thing among things created but proclaims enwrapped in His praise in other words everything says subhāna’Llāh wa-bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’; but you do not understand their glorification because it is not proclaimed in your language. Lo! He is Forbearing Forgiving for He does not hasten to bring about your punishment."
