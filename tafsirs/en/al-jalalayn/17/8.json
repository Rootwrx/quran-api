  "text": "And We said in the Scripture It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you after the second time if you were to repent; but if you revert to working corruption We too will revert to punishment. And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet s and so he was given power over them through the slaying of the Banū Qurayza the expulsion of the Banū Nadīr and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers a place of detention and a prison for them."
