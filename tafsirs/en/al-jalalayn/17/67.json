  "text": "And when distress difficulty befalls you at sea such as fear of drowning those whom you are wont to invoke are no longer present those whom you are wont to worship of gods are no longer present and so you do not call on them — except Him exalted be He for on Him alone you do call because you are suffering a distress which only He can remove. But when He delivers you from drowning and brings you to land you are rejective of God’s Oneness for man is ever ungrateful ever denying God’s graces."
