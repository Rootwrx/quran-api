Whoever is slain wrongfully We have certainly given his heir the one inheriting from him a warrant a sanction to retaliate against the slayer; but let him not commit excess let him not overstep the bounds in slaying by slaying other than the killer of the one slain or by other than that instrument with which he the slain was killed; for he is supported by the Law."
