  "text": "And for a part of the night keep vigil perform prayer therewith with the Qur’ān as a supererogatory devotion for you as an extra obligation for you to the exclusion of your community or it means as extra merit for you on top of the other obligatory prayers. It may be that your Lord will raise you to establish you in the Hereafter in a praiseworthy station one for which the first and last of mankind will praise you — and this is the station of intercession which will take place during the passing of the Final Judgement."
