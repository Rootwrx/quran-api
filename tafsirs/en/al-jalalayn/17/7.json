  "text": "And We said ‘If you are virtuous through acts of obedience you are being virtuous to your own souls since the reward thereof is for them your souls; and if you do evil by way of working corruption it is for them’ your evildoing. So when the time the occasion for the other prophecy comes We will raise them forth that they might ravage you make you grieve through their slaying and taking captive of you a grief that will be manifest on your faces and that they might enter the Temple the Holy House of Jerusalem and destroy it just as they entered it and destroyed it the first time and that they might destroy lay waste all that they conquered all that they gained ascendancy over utterly with an utter wasting. They indeed wrought corruption a second time when they slew the prophet John. Thus Nebuchadnezzar was roused against them and so he slew thousands of them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House of Jerusalem."
