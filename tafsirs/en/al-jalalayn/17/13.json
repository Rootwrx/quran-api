  "text": "And We have attached every person’s omen — his deeds — for him to carry upon his neck — this site is singled out for mention because fastening something to it is much more severe; Mujāhid b. Jabr al-Makkī said ‘There is not a child born but it has a leaf around its neck in which it is decreed that the child will be either fortunate or damned’ — and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book in which his deeds are recorded and which he will find wide open yalqāhu manshūran both are adjectival qualifications of kitāban ‘a book’."
