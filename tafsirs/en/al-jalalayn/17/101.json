Q. 1088 the years of dearth and scarcity of fruits cf. Q. 7130. Ask O Muhammad (s) the Children of Israel about this a rhetorical question meant as an affirmation for the idolaters of your sincerity; or it means that We said to him Muhammad (s) ‘Ask’; a variant reading has the past tense fa-sā’ala ‘and he asked’ when he came to them Pharaoh said to him ‘O Moses I truly think that you are bewitched’ duped your mind deceived."
