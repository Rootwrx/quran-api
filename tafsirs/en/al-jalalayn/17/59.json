However We have judged that they be given respite so that the mission of Muhammad (s) be completed. And We gave ThamÅ«d the she-camel as a sign that was apparent one that was clear and evident but they wronged they disbelieved it and were therefore destroyed. And We do not send signs miracles except for deterrence to servants so that they might believe."
