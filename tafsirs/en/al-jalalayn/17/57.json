  "text": "Those whom they call gods they themselves seek a means to their Lord they seek nearness by way of obedience which of them ayyuhum substitutes for the third person indicator wāw of the verb yabtaghūna ‘they seek’ in other words even he seeks it this nearness the one who is nearer to Him so how much more is it sought in the case of others?; and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement just like others so how can you call them gods? Truly your Lord’s chastisement is a thing to beware of."
