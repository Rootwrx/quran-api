God exalted be He says God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud unless a person has been wronged Q. 4148; He exalted be He also says so whoever commits aggression against you commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you Q. 2194; and those poets and others who are wrongdoers will soon know the reversal the return with which they will meet by which they will return after death."
