He is indeed your chief the one who has taught you sorcery — so that he only taught you some tricks and then surpassed you with others. Soon you will know what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on opposite sides — in other words the right hand of each one together with his left leg — then I shall surely crucify you all.’"
