  "text": "And We have enjoined man to be kind husnan a variant reading has ihsānan that is to say We have commanded him to act kindly towards both of them thus ihsānan is in the accusative as a verbal noun because of the implied verbal action; the same applies to husnan to his parents. His mother carries him in travail and gives birth to him in travail that is to say with suffering; and his gestation and his weaning from suckling take thirty months six months being the minimum period for gestation the remainder being the maximum period of suckling; it is also said that regardless of whether she bore him for six or nine months she should suckle him for the remainder. So that hattā is a particle of purpose for an implied sentence that is to say wa-‘āsha hattā ‘and he lived on so that …’ when he is mature namely at his prime in terms of his strength intellect and reasoning the minimum age for which is thirty or thirty three years and reaches forty years that is exactly forty years which is the maximum for attaining maturity he says ‘My Lord! this to the end of this verse was revealed regarding Abū Bakr al-Siddīq when he had reached forty years of age two years after the beginning of the Prophet’s Mission s. He Abū Bakr believed in him whereafter his parents believed in the Prophet followed by his son ‘Abd al-Rahmān then ‘Abd al-Rahmān’s son Abū ‘Atīq Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Rahmān. Inspire me to give thanks for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents namely the grace of affirming God’s Oneness and that I may act righteously in a way that will please You thus he Abū Bakr emancipated nine believers who had been enduring torture at the hands of the idolaters for their belief in God and invest my seed with righteousness all of them were believers. Indeed I repent to You and I am truly of those who submit to You’."
