Salām to the like of it that is to say to it the Qur’ān that it is from God and he the witness has believed in it while you act with arrogance …’ you are disdainful of faith the response to the conditional ‘if …’ is given by implication in what has been supplemented to it in other words ‘Would you not then be considered wrongdoers?’; this understanding of the response is indicated by what follows.
