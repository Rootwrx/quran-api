Already many of them have come before me so how can you deny me? Nor do I know what will be done with me or with you in this world will I be made to leave my native land or will I be slain as was done with some prophets before me or will you stone me to death or will the earth be made to swallow you as it did deniers before you? I only follow what is revealed to me that is the Qur’ān and I do not invent anything myself. And I am only a plain warner’ one whose warning is plain."
