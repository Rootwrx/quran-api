  "text": "destroying ruining everything it passes through by the command of its Lord by His will that is to say destroying everything that He wants to destroy with it. And so it destroyed their men women children and properties by flinging them up into the air high above the ground and tearing them to pieces. Only HÅ«d and those who believed with him remained unscathed. So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus in the way that We requited them do We requite guilty folk besides them."
