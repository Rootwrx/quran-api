And do not seek to hasten it for them for your people the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he the Prophet seemed by this stage to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them which is why he was enjoined to exercise patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement for them — for it would befall them eventually without doubt. It shall seem for them on the day when they see what they are promised of chastisement in the Hereafter given its long duration as though they had tarried in this world by their reckoning only an hour of a day. This Qur’ān is a communication a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed that is to say none shall be destroyed upon seeing the chastisement but the immoral folk? that is to say the disbelieving folk."
