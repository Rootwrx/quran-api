  "text": "The Bedouins — a group of men from among the Banū Asad — say ‘We believe’ we affirm the truth in our hearts. Say to them ‘You do not believe; but rather say “We have submitted” we are outwardly compliant; for faith has not yet entered into your hearts’ hitherto; however it is expected of you. Yet if you obey God and His Messenger by embracing faith and in other ways He will not diminish for you read ya’litkum or yalitkum by making the hamza an alif anything of your deeds that is of the reward for them. God is indeed Forgiving to believers Merciful to them."
