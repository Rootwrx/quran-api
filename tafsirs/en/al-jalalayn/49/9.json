Fighting then ensued between the two clans with fists sandals and palm branches being thrown about fall to fighting iqtatalū the plural is used on account of the plural import for each party is made up of several individuals; a variant reading has the dual form iqtatalatā make peace between them baynahumā the dual here takes into account the actual dual form of tā’ifatān ‘two parties’. And if one of them aggresses against the other fight the one which aggresses until it returns to God’s ordinance to the truth. Then if it returns reconcile them fairly and act justly. Surely God loves the just."
