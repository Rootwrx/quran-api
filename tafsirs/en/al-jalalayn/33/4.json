  "text": "God has not placed two hearts inside any man this was revealed in order to refute those disbelievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad’s single mind; nor has He made your wives whom read as allā’ī or allā’ you repudiate by zihār read tazzahharūna or tuzāhirūna; the original tā’ of tatazāharūna has been assimilated with the zā’ — a man would say to his wife for example ‘You are for me as untouchable as my mother’s back’ — your mothers in other words He has not made you wives like your mothers so that they are illicit for conjugality in that respect a practice which in pre-Islamic times was considered a valid form of divorce. An atonement with necessary conditions is necessary in such a case as mentioned in sūrat al-Mujādila Q. 582-3. Nor has He made those whom you claim as adopted sons ad‘iyā’ the plural of da‘iyy which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his biological father your sons in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths namely of the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet s married Zaynab bt. Jahsh who had been Zayd b. Hāritha’s wife the adopted son of the Prophet s they said ‘Muhammad married his son’s wife!’ and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth in this matter and He guides to the way the way of truth."
