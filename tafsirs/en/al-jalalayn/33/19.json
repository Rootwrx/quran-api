  "text": "grudging to you in their help ashihha ‘grudging’ is the plural of shahīh and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tūna ‘they engage’. And when there is a panic you see them looking at you their eyes rolling like one that is like the look of one or the rolling of one fainting at death in other words one in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides and the spoils have been secured they scald you they hurt you or they smite you with their sharp tongues in their greed for the riches in other words for the spoils which they demand greedily. Those they never believed really. Therefore God has invalidated their works and that invalidation is easy for God by His will."
