Remember God’s favour to you when hosts of disbelievers came against you as confederates at the time the Ditch al-khandaq was being dug and We unleashed against them a great wind and hosts of angels you did not see. And God is ever Seer of what you do read ta‘malūna to imply ‘in the way of your digging of the ditch’; or read ya‘malūna ‘of what they do’ to imply ‘the idolaters’ forming of a confederation’."
