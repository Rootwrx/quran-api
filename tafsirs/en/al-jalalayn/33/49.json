But provide for them give them what they can use for securing comforts in cases where no dowry has been fixed for them; otherwise theirs is to retain half of what was fixed but no more — this is what Ibn ‘Abbās said and it is the opinion followed by al-Shāfi‘ī’; and release them in a gracious manner leave them be without the intention to cause them any harm."
