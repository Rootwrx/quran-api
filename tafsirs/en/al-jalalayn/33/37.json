  "text": "And when idh is dependent because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention when’ you said to him to whom God had shown favour by guiding him to Islam and to whom you too had shown favour by manumitting him — this was Zayd b. Hāritha who had been a prisoner of war before the coming of Islam in the period of al-jāhiliyya. The Messenger of God s purchased him before his call to prophethood and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son — ‘Retain your wife for yourself and fear God’ before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose what He was to manifest of your love for her and of the fact that should Zayd part with her you would marry her and you feared people would say ‘He has married his son’s wife!’ though God is worthier that you should fear Him in all things so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her obligatory waiting period was completed. God exalted be He says So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her We joined her in marriage to you — the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without the customary permission from her legal guardian and gratified the Muslims with a feast of bread and meat — so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God’s commandment that which He has decreed is bound to be realised."
