  "text": "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own souls in terms of what he calls them to and what their own souls have called them to contravene and his wives are their mothers insofar as they the believers are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood kinsmen are more entitled to inherit from one another in the Book of God than the other believers and the Emigrants in other words than inheriting on account of their sharing faith and the Emigration which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends by making a bequest which is permissible. This namely the abrogation of inheritance on account of shared faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship is written in the Book — in both instances al-kitāb ‘the Book’ denotes the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz."
