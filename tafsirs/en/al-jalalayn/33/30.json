  "text": "O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits manifest indecency read mubayyana or mubayyina meaning respectively ‘it has become evident’ meaning ‘one that is evident’ the chastisement shall be doubled yudā‘af a variant reading has 2nd form yuda‘‘af and still another has nuda‘‘if ‘We shall double’ in which case read al-‘adhāba as accusative for her in other words twice the chastisement for other women; and that is easy for God."
