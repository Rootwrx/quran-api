  "text": "O you who believe do not enter the Prophet’s houses unless permission is granted you to enter by invitation to share a meal and so you enter without waiting for the right moment for when it is ready ināhu a verbal noun from anā ya’nī. But when you are invited enter and when you have had your meal disperse without lingering for any leisurely conversation amongst yourselves. Indeed that lingering is upsetting for the Prophet and he is too shy of you to make you leave but God is not shy of the truth that you should leave — in other words He would never refrain from declaring it a variant reading for yastahyī has yastahī. And when you ask anything of his womenfolk in other words the wives of the Prophet s ask them from behind a screen a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts than entertaining sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger of God hurt in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God’s sight would be very grave as a sin."
