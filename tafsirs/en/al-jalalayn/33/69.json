  "text": "O you who believe do not behave towards your Prophet as did those who harmed Moses — when they would say for example ‘The only reason he does not wash with us is that he has an inflammation in his testicles’ — whereat God absolved him of what they alleged when Moses placed his robe on a rock to go to wash the rock hurtled away with it until it came to a halt amid a group of men from the Children of Israel. As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself they saw that he had no such inflammation udra is an inflammation of the testicle. And he was distinguished in God’s sight. An instance of our Prophet s being subjected to hurt was when on one occasion while dividing up the spoils a man said to him ‘This is a division that I do not want to please God!’ whereat the Prophet s became angered and said ‘May God have mercy upon Moses for truly he was hurt with worse than this but endured’ — reported by al-Bukhārī."
