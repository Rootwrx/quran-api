It is said that this ilyāsīn is the same Elias mentioned above; but it is also said that this denotes him together with all those who were believers with him and so they have been coupled under the same term with him being the predominant as when one might say al-Muhallabūn ‘the Muhallabids’ to mean al-Muhallab and his folk; a variant reading has āl yāsīn by which is meant his family as well as Elias himself."
