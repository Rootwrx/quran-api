  "text": "Verily you have fulfilled the vision’ by what you have done in that you were able to go through with the act of sacrifice. In other words that which you have done suffices for you as redemption the statement nādaynāhu ‘We called to him’ is the response to the lammā ‘when’ so that the wāw in wa-nādaynāhu ‘We called to him’ is extra. So in the same way that We have rewarded you do We reward those who are virtuous to their own souls in obeying the Command of God by removing from them their distress."
