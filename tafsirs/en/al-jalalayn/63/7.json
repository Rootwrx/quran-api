  "text": "They are the ones who say to their companions from among the Helpers ‘Do not expend on those who are with the Messenger of God from among the Emigrants until they scatter off’ until they part with him. Yet to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth with what they contain of provision and so He is the provider for the Emigrants and others but the hypocrites do not understand."
