  "text": "So he watered their flock for them from another well nearby by lifting a rock from on top of it which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade of an acacia tree samura because of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry and said ‘My Lord indeed I am in utter need of whatever good whatever food You send down to me’. The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why it was so. They told him about the man who had watered their flock for them. So he said to one of them ‘Summon him to come to me’."
