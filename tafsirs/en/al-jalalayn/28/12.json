  "text": "And We had forbidden him to take to the breasts of fostermothers from before that is to say we prevented him from taking to the breasts of any suckling mother other than his own mother. Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she his sister said ‘Shall I show you a household — having seen their affection for him — who will take care of him for you by having him suckled and so on and who will act in good faith towards him?’ the suffixed pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king as a response to them when they asked Mary how she could be sure. Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her breast because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him just as God exalted be He says"
