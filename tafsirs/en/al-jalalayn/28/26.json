  "text": "One of the two women the one that had been sent by her father either the elder or the younger said ‘O my father hire him employ him in return for a wage that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best man you can hire is the strong the trustworthy man’ in other words hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He Shu‘ayb asked her about him and she told him as mentioned above how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her ‘Walk behind me’ in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him refusing to lift it until she left. He Shu‘ayb therefore was keen to have him marry one of his daughters."
