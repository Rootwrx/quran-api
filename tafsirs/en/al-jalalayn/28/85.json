  "text": "Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur’ān He Who has revealed it will surely restore you to a place of return to Mecca — he had yearned for it. Say ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error’ — this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan disbelievers had said to him ‘Indeed you are error’. In other words God is saying that he the Prophet is the one who has brought guidance while they are the ones in error."
