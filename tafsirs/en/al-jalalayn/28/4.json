  "text": "Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land the land of Egypt and reduced its people into sects groups to serve him oppressing a group of them namely the Children of Israel slaughtering their sons the new-born and sparing their women keeping them alive — for some of the Egyptian priests had told him ‘A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom’. Indeed he was of those who cause corruption through the use of slaughter and otherwise."
