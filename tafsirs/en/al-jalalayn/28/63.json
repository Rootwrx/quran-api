These are the ones whom we led astray hā’ūlā’i’lladhīna aghwaynā is both a subject and an adjectival qualification. We led them astray aghwaynāhum the predicate thereof and they went astray even as we went astray — we did not compel them to follow error. We declare our innocence of them before You; it was not us that they worshipped’ mā ‘not’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb ya‘budūna ‘they worshipped’ in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses."
