  "text": "Then Pharaoh’s folk aids picked him up with him still in the basket the morning following that night — it was placed him in front of him Pharaoh and then opened and Moses was brought out of it sucking milk from his thumb — to be at the end of the affair an enemy slaying their menfolk and a cause of grief to them enslaving their womenfolk a variant reading for hazanan is huznan both of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun and it functions as an active participle derived from hazanahu which is like ahzanahu ‘he caused him grief’. Truly Pharaoh and his minister Hāmān and their hosts were sinners that is disobedient and so they were punished at his Moses’s hands."
