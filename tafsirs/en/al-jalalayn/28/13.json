  "text": "Thus We restored him to his mother so that her eyes might delight in seeing him again and not grieve thereat and that she might know that God’s promise to restore him to her is true; but most of them that is the people do not know about this promise or of the fact that this was his sister and the other was his mother. He Moses remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory harbī. She then brought him back to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised as God recounts of him in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ Q. 2618 Did we not rear you among us as a child and did you not stay with us for years of your life?"
