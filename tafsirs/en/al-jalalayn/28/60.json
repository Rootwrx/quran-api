  "text": "And whatever things you have been given are only the short-lived enjoyment of the life of this world and an ornament thereof in other words things which you enjoy and adorn yourselves with for the days of your lives after which they perish; and what is with God in other words His reward is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? ta‘qilūna; or read ya‘qilūna ‘will they not understand’ that what lasts is better than what perishes."
