  "text": "And We revealed by inspiration or in a dream to the mother of Moses — who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth — ‘Suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the waters namely the Nile and do not fear that he should drown or grieve for being separated from him for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers’. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and cast it into the waters of the Nile at night."
