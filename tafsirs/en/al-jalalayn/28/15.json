  "text": "And he Moses entered the city Pharaoh’s city Memphis having been absent from it for a while at a time when its people were oblivious the time of the afternoon nap and found therein two men fighting one of his own faction namely an Israelite and the other of his enemies in other words an Egyptian who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies and so Moses said to him ‘Leave him be!’ and it is said that he replied to Moses thus ‘I am truly considering making you carry this firewood!’. So Moses punched him that is he hit him with his fist clenched — he Moses was a strong man with a powerful strike and did away with him that is he killed him but he had not intended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said ‘This killing of him is of Satan’s doing inciting my anger. Indeed he is an enemy to the son of Adam a manifest misleader’ of him."
