  "text": "And they did not become divided that is the adherents of the monotheistic religions did not become divided in religion — so that some affirmed the Oneness of God while others rejected it — except after the knowledge of His Oneness had come to them out of jealous rivalry on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord to defer requital of them until an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection it would have already been judged between them to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them namely the Jews and the Christians are truly in grave doubt concerning him Muhammad (s)."
