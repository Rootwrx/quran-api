And say ‘I believe in whatever Book God has revealed. And I have been commanded to be just between you in passing judgement. God is our Lord and your Lord. Our deeds concern us and your deeds concern you and so each one of us will be requited according to his own deeds. There is no argument no dispute between us and you — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. God will bring us together at the time of the Return to decide definitively between us and to Him is the final destination’ the ultimate return."
