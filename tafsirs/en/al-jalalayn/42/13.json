  "text": "He has prescribed for you as a religion that which He enjoined upon Noah — for he was the first of the prophets sent with a Divine Law — and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus declaring ‘Establish religion and do not be divided in it’ this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon those mentioned above and what has been revealed to Muhammad (s) and it is the affirmation of God’s Oneness. Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them in the way of affirming the Oneness of God. God chooses for it for the task of affirming His Oneness whomever He will and He guides to it whomever turns penitently whomever applies himself to obedience of Him."
