  "text": "For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it the latter is also referred to as ‘an evil deed’ because in outward form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for wounds. Some scholars say that even if another were to say ‘May God disgrace you!’ then one should respond equally with ‘May God disgrace you!’. But whoever pardons his wrongdoer and reconciles the amity between himself and the one pardoned his reward will be with God that is to say God will give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers that is those who initiate acts of wrongdoing and so merit His punishment."
