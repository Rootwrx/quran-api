  "text": "Or have they taken idols as guardians besides Him? am ‘or’ is disjunctive functioning with the sense of bal ‘nay but’ the one used to denote a shift in the subject matter; the hamza is for denial in other words ‘those who are taken’ as guardians are not in fact guardians of anything. But God He alone is the Guardian in other words then One who helps believers the fā’ of fa’Llāhu is merely for coordination and He revives the dead and He has power over all things."
