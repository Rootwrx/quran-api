  "text": "as if they were dark yellow camels jimālātun is the plural of jimalatun the plural of jamalun; a variant reading has jimālatun in terms of their shape and colour. In hadīth it is stated ‘The sparks of humans thrown into the air by the Fire are black as pitch qīr’; the Arabs call dark camels sufr ‘yellow’ because a touch of yellow is mixed with their blackish colour and therefore it is said that ‘yellow’ in this verse actually means ‘black’ on account of what has been mentioned; but some say no to this interpretation; sharar is the plural of sharāra; qīr is qār ‘pitch’."
