This is the Remembrance of those with me namely my community and that Remembrance is the Qur’ān and the Remembrance of those before me of communities namely the Torah and the Gospel and other Books of God not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god in the way that they claim — exalted be He above such a thing. Nay but most of them do not know the truth the affirmation of God’s Oneness and so they are disregardful’ of that discernment that leads to knowledge of it."
