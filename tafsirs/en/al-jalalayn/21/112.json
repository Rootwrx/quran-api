And so they were chastised at the battles of Badr Uhud Hunayn al-Ahzāb and al-Khandaq and he the Prophet was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One Whose help is to be sought against what you allege’ when you invent lies against God saying that ‘God has taken a son’ cf. Q. 2116; and against me when you say ‘he is a sorcerer’ cf. Q. 384 or against the Qur’ān when you say ‘it is poetry’ cf. Q. 5230."
