  "text": "So We responded to him in his call and removed the harm that had befallen him and We gave him back his family his male and female children by bringing them back to life — of each sex there were three or seven along with them other children the like of them from his wife for she was made younger. He had also possessed a threshing floor for wheat and another for barley so God sent two clouds and one of them poured forth gold onto the wheat threshing floor and the other poured forth silver onto the barley threshing floor until they overflowed; as a mercy rahmatan a direct object denoting reason from Us min ‘indinā an adjectival phrase and a reminder to worshippers that they be patient and thus be rewarded by God."
