  "text": "Had there been in either of them that is in the heavens and the earth gods other than God that is other than Him the two would have surely deteriorated they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because counteractive forces would exist among such gods as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus regarding something. So glory be to God — an exaltation — the Lord the Creator of the Throne al-kursī above what they ascribe the disbelievers to God of His having a partner and otherwise."
