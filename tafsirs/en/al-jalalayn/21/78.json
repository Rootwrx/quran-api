David decreed to the owner of the tillage belong the head of the sheep. Solomon decreed he shall benefit from the use of their milk offspring and wool until such time as the tillage is restored to its original state at the hands of the owner of the sheep after which he the owner of the tillage should return them the sheep to him their owner."
