He was the first human being to make them; hitherto there were only plates of armour — for you as well as all mankind to protect you read nuhsinakum the subject being ‘God’; or yuhsinakum the subject being ‘David’; or tuhsinakum the subject being ‘garments’ against your mutual violence your wars against your enemies.
