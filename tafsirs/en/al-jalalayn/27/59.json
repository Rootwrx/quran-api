Is God read a-Allāhu pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without such an insertion better for those who worship Him or the partners which they ascribe? read either tushrikūna ‘you ascribe’ or yushrikūna ‘they ascribe’ they being the people of Mecca the partners they ascribe to Him in other words are such gods better for those who worship them?"
