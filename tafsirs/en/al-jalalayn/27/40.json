  "text": "The one who had knowledge of the revealed Scripture — and this was one Āsif b. Barkhiyā a righteous individual with knowledge of God’s Greatest Name which when invoked in supplication for something it is immediately granted — said ‘I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you after you look at something. So he the afreet said to him ‘Look up towards the heaven’ which he did and when his glance returned in front of him he found it Bilqīs’ throne placed before him — for in the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven Āsif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name that God bring it thereto; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it sprung up below Solomon’s seat kursī. Then when he saw it standing still before him he said ‘This bringing it to me is of my Lord’s bounty that He may try me test me whether I give thanks read a-ashkur pronouncing both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without the insertion or am ungrateful for the favour. And whoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his thanks shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for the favour should know then my Lord is surely Independent with no need of his thanks Generous’ by being bounteous to those who are ungrateful for it."
