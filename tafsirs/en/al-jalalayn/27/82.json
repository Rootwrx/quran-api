  "text": "And when the word of judgement falls upon them when they deserve that chastisement befalls them as well as all other disbelievers We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth which shall speak to them saying that is which shall speak in Arabic to those who are alive at the time when it appears among its other statements it will say to them on Our behalf ‘Indeed mankind read tukallimuhum inna’l-nāsa; a variant has tukallimuhum bi-anna’l-nāsa ‘to tell them that mankind’ had no faith in Our signs’ in other words they did not believe in the Qur’ān and what it comprises of the mention of resurrection reckoning and requital. With its the beast’s appearance the enjoining of decency and forbidding of indecency will cease and thereafter no disbeliever will believe — just as God revealed to Noah when He said to him None of your people will believe except he who has already believed Q. 1136."
