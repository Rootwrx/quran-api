  "text": "So when she came it was said to her ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said ‘It as though it is the one’. She had in fact recognised it; but she made a pretence to them just as they made a pretence to her given that when she was asked about the throne it was not said ‘Is this your throne?’ for had it been so she would have replied ‘Yes it is’. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable he said ‘And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted to God."
