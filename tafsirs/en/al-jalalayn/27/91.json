Such were the graces bestowed by God upon its inhabitants the tribe of Quraysh graces whereby God has spared their land the suffering and civil strife common to all the other lands of the Arabs; and to Whom exalted be He all things belong for He is their Lord Creator and Possessor. And I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God by affirming His Oneness;"
