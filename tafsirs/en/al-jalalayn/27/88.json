  "text": "And you see the mountains you notice them at the moment of the Blast supposing them to be still stationary in their place because of their tremendous size while they drift like passing clouds like the drifting of the rain when it is blown around by the wind in other words they the mountains will be drifting in like manner until they eventually fall to the ground whereby they are flattened before becoming like tufts of ‘wool’ cf. Q. 1015 and then ‘scattered dust’ cf. Q. 566. God’s handiwork sun‘a a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence and which has been annexed in a genitive construction to its agent Allāhi ‘God’ after the omission of its operator Who has perfected everything that He has made. Truly He is aware of what you do taf‘alūna; or read yaf‘alūna ‘what they do’ namely His enemies what they do in the way of disobedience and His friends in the way of obedience."
