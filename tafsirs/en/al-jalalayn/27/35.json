If it be a king to whom we have sent it he will accept it; but if it be a prophet he will reject it. Thus she sent male and female servants one thousand in total together with five hundred bricks of gold a crown studded with jewels and musk ambergris and other things with an envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon who ordered bricks of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a vast square the distance of nine parasangs from his seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it and for the most splendid creatures of the land and the sea together with the children of the jinn to be brought to line the right and left sides of the square."
