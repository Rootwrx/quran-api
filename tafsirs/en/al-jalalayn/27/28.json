  "text": "Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them that is to Bilqīs and her people then turn away withdraw from them but remain close by them and see what response they shall return’ and see what kind of response they shall give. Thus he took it and approached her Bilqīs. But as her soldiers were all around her he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it she shuddered and was consumed by fear. She read what it said."
