  "text": "Or He Who originates creation in the wombs from a sperm-drop then brings it back again after death as established by the proofs for this resurrection even if you do not acknowledge it; and Who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth vegetation. Is there a god with God? In other words none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God and there is no god with Him. Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Produce your proof your definitive argument if you are truthful’ about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned."
