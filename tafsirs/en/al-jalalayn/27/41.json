  "text": "He said ‘Disguise her throne for her — in other words transform it such that when she sees it it will be in an unrecognisable form — that we may see whether she will be guided to recognising it or be of those who cannot be guided’ to recognise when things are transformed around them. He Solomon sought thereby to test her mind for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed it by adding or taking away certain things and in other ways."
