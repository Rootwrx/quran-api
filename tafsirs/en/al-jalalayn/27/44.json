  "text": "It was also said to her ‘Enter the palace hallway’ — this was a transparent white glass floor underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it she supposed it to be a pool of water and so she bared her legs to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace hallway and he saw that her legs and feet were in fact fair. He said to her ‘It is a hallway paved smooth with crystal’ and thereafter he called her to submit to God. She said ‘My Lord indeed I have wronged myself by worshipping other than You and I submit with Solomon to God the Lord of the Worlds’. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a depilatory lime mixture nūra and she removed it therewith. He married her and had great love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month staying for three days every time. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 — Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!"
