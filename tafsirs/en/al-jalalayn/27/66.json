  "text": "Nay has their knowledge come to comprise read adraka similar to the 4th verbal form akrama ‘he was kind to’; a variant reading has iddāraka which is actually tadāraka with the tā’ changed into a dāl and assimilated with the other dāl and a conjunctive hamza added meaning ‘attained’ or ‘caught up with’ the Hereafter? such that they have reason to ask about the time of its coming — not so Nay for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it ‘amūna ‘blind’ as in blindness of the heart; this statement is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin of the term is ‘amiyūn but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the yā’ and has been moved to the mīm after dropping its kasra vowel."
