Is there a god a-ilāhun here and in the seven instances in which it occurs read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second inserting an alif between the two in both cases with God? who has helped Him in all of this? In other words there is no god with Him. Nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to Him who associate with God others."
