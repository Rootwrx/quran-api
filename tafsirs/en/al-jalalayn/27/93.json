Thus on the day of Badr God showed them how it was to be killed to be taken prisoner and to be beaten by the angels on their faces and backs; and God hastened on for them the punishment of the Fire. And your Lord is not oblivious of what they do’ ya‘malūna; or read ta‘malūna ‘what you do’ but grants them respite until their appointed time of requital."
