  "text": "Mention when Moses said to his family to his wife during his journey from Midian back to Egypt ‘Assuredly I notice I see in the distance a fire. I will bring you news from there about the journey’s route — for he had lost his way — or bring you a firebrand read as a genitive annexation bi-shihābi qabasin as an explication of shihāb ‘flame’; or read without annexation bi-shihābin qabasin meaning a flame of fire at the end of a wick or a wooden stick that perhaps you might warm yourselves’ tastalūn the tā’ replaces the tā’ of the 8th verbal form ifta‘ala sc. istalā; it derives from salaya or saliya ‘to be exposed to the blaze of fire’ that perhaps you might warm yourselves from the cold."
