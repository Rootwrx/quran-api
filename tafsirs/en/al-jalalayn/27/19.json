  "text": "Whereat he Solomon smiled fa-tabassama the beginning of the sentence amused dāhikan the end of the sentence at its words which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of entering their valley he Solomon made his hosts halt until they the ants had entered their dwellings — on this journey his hosts consisted of cavalry and infantry. And he said ‘My Lord inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured me and my parents and to do good that will please You and include me by Your mercy among Your righteous servants’ the prophets and saints."
