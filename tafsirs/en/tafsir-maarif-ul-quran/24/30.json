  "text": "Commentary\nAn important chapter for the prevention of obscenity and security of chastity: Hijab for women\nThe very first verses on the subject of hijab for women are the ones which were revealed in Surah Ahzab at the time of marriage of the mother of the believers Sayyidah Zainab bint Jahash ؓ with the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Some have given the date of revelation of these verses as 3rd Hijra while others say it was 5th Hijra. Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Nail Al-Autar have given preference to the latter date, while Ruh ul-Mani has reported on the authority of Sayyidna Anas ؓ that this marriage was solemnized in Dhulqa'dah 5th Hijra. But it is an agreed position that the first verse on Hijab was revealed on this occasion. As for the above referred verses of Surah an-Nur, they were revealed at the time of incident of Ifk, which had happened on return from the battle of Bani Mustaliq or Muraisi`. This battle had taken place in the 6th Hijra. Hence, it is clear from the revelation point of view that Surah An-Nur's verses on hijab were revealed later, and Surah Ahzab's four verses were revealed earlier, and that the practice on the injunction of hijab had started when the verses of Surah Alhzab were revealed. The subject of hijab will be discussed Insh’ Allah in detail under Surah Ahzab. Here the explanation will be restricted to only those verses which appear in Surah an-Nur.\nقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا مِنْ أَبْصَارِ‌هِمْ وَيَحْفَظُوا فُرُ‌وجَهُمْ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَزْكَىٰ لَهُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّـهَ خَبِيرٌ‌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ ﴿30﴾\nSay to the believing men that they must lower their gazes andguard their private parts; it is more decent for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do. (24:30)\nThe word يَغُضُّ (yaghuddu) is derived from غضّ (ghadd), which means to bring down or to lower, (Raghib) lowering of eyes or to keep eyes down as enjoined in the verse, means to turn the eyes from something which is prohibited to be seen by Shari` ah (Ibn Kathir). Ibn Hibban has given the explanation that to look at a non-Mahram woman with intent to have (sexual) pleasure is totally prohibited, and to look without any such motive is makruh (undesirable). To look at any woman's or man's private parts of the body is included in this explanation (except in case of dire necessity, such as medical examination). Peeping into anyone's house with the intent of finding out his secrets, and all such acts where looking is prohibited by Shari` ah are all included in the injunction. (24:30)\nوَيَحْفَظُوا فُرُ‌وجَهُمْ Protection of private parts is purported to express that all possible situations of satisfying unlawful sexual desires be guarded against. In this, adultery, sodomy, lesbian act, masturbation and all such acts that fulfill unlawful lust and passions are prohibited. The purpose of the verse is to prohibit all illicit acts for fulfilling unlawful passions. For this purpose the initial and the ultimate acts have been mentioned rather clearly, and all those actions which fall in between them are also included in the prohibition. For unlawful sexual passion the very first act is casting eye with bad motive and its ultimate result is adultery. Both these acts have been mentioned clearly and are prohibited. All other acts falling in between, such as touching hands or having conversation, are included by implication.\nIbn Kathir has related Sayyidna ` Ubaidah ؓ having said . کُلّ ما عصی اللہ بہ فھو کبیرۃ وقد ذکر الطفین that is ` Any act done in disobedience to Allah is a major sin, but the initial and ultimate acts are mentioned at the two ends of the verse'. The initial act is to cast eye, and the ultimate is adultery. Tabarani has quoted Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said:\nالنظر سھم من سھام ابلیس مسموم من ترکھا مخافتی ابدلتہ ایمانا یجد حلاوۃ فی قلبہ (از ابن کثیر)\n` Casting eye is a poisonous arrow among the arrows of Satan. Whoever turns away his eye fearing from Me (despite demand of the heart), I will give him such strong faith, the delight of which he will feel in his heart'. (Ibn Kathir)\nIt is reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Sayyidna Jarir Ibn ` Abdullah al-Bajali ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has advised what should one do if by chance one's eye is cast on a non-Mahram woman. He has quoted the Holy Prophet ﷺ as saying ` Turn away your eyes from there'. (Ibn Kathir). Sayyidna Ali ؓ has said that first sight is forgivable, but casting eye a second time is sin. Both versions are alike, that is, if one casts his eye by chance without intention, it is forgiven being not intentional, otherwise it is prohibited to cast the eye intentionally, even the first time.\nTo stare intentionally at boys having no beard also falls within this ruling\nIbn Kathir has reported that many elders of the Ummah used to forbid forcefully staring at young boys (having no beard), and many scholars have declared it as forbidden (Perhaps it is in a situation when one looks with bad intention and passionate desire. God knows best)",
