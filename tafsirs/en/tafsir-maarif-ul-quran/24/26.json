And good women are for good men and good men are for good women. Those are free from what they (the accusers) say. For them there is forgiveness and a graceful provision - 24:26.\nIt means that the vulgar women are suitable for vulgar men and the vulgar men are suitable for vulgar women. And pure women are worthy for pure men and pure men are worthy for pure women.\nIn this last verse the common principle is stated that Allah Ta’ ala has created a connection between the people of the same nature. Thus, vulgar and unchaste women are inclined towards vulgar and unchaste men and vice versa. Similarly, pure and chaste women show inclination towards pure and decent men and vice versa. Therefore, everyone tries to find the spouse according to one's inclination and liking, and in a natural way one does find one to suit him or her.\nIn the light of this norm and principle it is now quite clear that the messengers of Allah, who are the models of purity and chastity both outwardly and inwardly in this world, are granted spouses by Allah Ta’ ala in accordance with their status. Hence, the Holy Prophet\tﷺ ، who is the head of all messengers, was bestowed with spouses who were befitting to his position and status in purity, chastity and ethical excellence, and Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ is more prominent among them all. Only those can have any doubt or suspicion about her who do not have faith in the Holy Prophet\tﷺ himself. It is mentioned about the wives of Sayyidna Nuh and Sayyidna Lut (علیہم السلام) in the Qur'an that they (wives) were disbelievers, but it is also established that they were not involved in any obscenity or vulgarity. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ said\tما بغت امرأۃ نبی قطّ Never did any wife of a messenger commit adultery'. (ذکرفی الدر المنثور). It is, therefore, corroborated that it is possible that a messenger's wife could be a disbeliever, but it is not possible that she could be vulgar and sexually immoral, because adultery is a natural detestable act in the eyes of people, whereas disbelief is not a natural detestable thing.
