  "text": "Commentary\nThe fifth injunction regarding mutual meetings and asking permission before entering anyone's home\nRight from the beginning of Surah An-Nur it is enjoined to curb the obscenity and immorality in the society, and to restrain this, various punishments are prescribed. Then labeling of false accusation on someone is condemned. After that such injunctions are enjoined which can check these obscenities and safeguard the chastity and continence, and also create an atmosphere to eliminate the conditions of their development. The issues and instructions regarding seeking permission before entering anyone's house (Isti'dhan) also fall within these injunctions. Hence, entering in anyone's house or to peep in without the permission of the owner has been prohibited. The wisdom in this instruction is that one should not cast an eye on women who are not one's mahram (with whom marriage is prohibited). In the above verses various instructions are given against various types of houses.\nThere are four categories of houses. One, in which one lives, where there is no possibility of the presence of some stranger. Two, where someone else is also residing, irrespective of being mahram or not, and where there is a possibility of someone's entry. Three, where there are both possibilities that someone is living or the house is empty. Four, a house which is not specified for anyone's living, such as, a mosque, school, monastery, shrine etc., where all people go in. Out of these four categories it is obvious that there is no need of asking permission to go in the houses of the first kind. Hence, the first category is not mentioned specifically in these verses, but for the other three categories injunctions are spelled out.\nAn important aspect of Qur’ anic social ethic is that if you go to meet someone, first ask the permission and do not enter in anyone's house without permission.\nIt is a pity that the amount of importance Islam has attached to ethics of visiting someone by providing detailed instructions about them in the Qur'an, and which were strongly emphasized by the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، both by practice and oral teachings, the present day Muslims neglect them by the same margin. Even the pious and educated people do not regard this a sin, nor do they make an effort to act on them. The other civilized nations of the world have adopted them to improve their society, but the Muslims have lagged behind them all. This was the very first Islamic injunction which was overlooked by the Muslims to begin with. It is worth noting that seeking permission (Isti'dhan) is that injunction of the Holy Qur'an in which even the slightest laxity or alteration is termed by Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ as the rejection of the Qur'an itself. As a matter of fact now people overlook these injunctions so much as if they are not part of the Holy Qur'an. إِنَّا لِلَّـهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَ‌اجِعُونَ\nWisdom of seeking permission (Isti'dhan)\nAllah Ta’ ala has provided every person a place where he lives, whether he owns it or has acquired it on rent. Such a place is his home, and the real purpose of a home is to provide comfort and tranquility. When the Holy Qur'an has referred to one's home as a great blessing of Allah, it has an indication towards this basic objective of a home. The Qur'an says, جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّن بُيُوتِكُمْ سَكَنًا (16:80) It means that Allah has given you peace and comfort through your homes. One can enjoy peace and comfort in his home only when he can live there without the interference of anyone else, and can rest and work at will. Any interference in his freedom is tantamount to killing the very purpose of the home, which is naturally very damaging. Islam has prohibited harming anyone without any cause. A great wisdom in the injunction of seeking permission is to save people from interference of others and its consequent ill effects, which is obligatory on all peace loving people.\nThe other consideration in the injunction is for the visitor himself, in that if he would go in to meet someone after taking permission, then the host will also reciprocate his gesture by giving him due importance and respect. If his visit is with purpose then the host will be sympathetic and try to meet his need. On the other hand, if he would go in to call on someone without taking his permission, like an uncouth, then naturally he would not be so welcome, and the host would like to get rid of him as quickly as possible. Even if the host had any sympathy toward him, it would be reduced, and the sin for causing trouble to a Muslim would be additional.\nThe third consideration is the elimination of obscenity and immorality. If one enters someone's home without taking prior permission, the possibility is that he might see the ladies of the house, which may lead to temptations. It is for this reason that the injunctions on seeking permission are placed next to punishment of adultery and punishment of false accusation etc.\nThe fourth consideration is that sometimes one is busy in the solitude of his home doing something which he does not want others to see. If someone comes into his house unannounced, then that act will be known to others, which he wanted to conceal. Any attempt to disclose the secrets of others is also a sin and a source of vexation. Some issues concerning seeking permission have been described in the above verses themselves, so they should be considered first. Other related issues will be dealt with later.\nRuling\nIn these verses the address is with the phrase يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا (0 those who believe) which is used for men, (because the relative pronoun in the text الَّذِينَ is originally of masculine gender) but women are also included in the injunction, like other Qur'anic injunctions, which are normally addressed to men but women are included in them, except in some cases where it is expressly mentioned that they are exclusive for men. Therefore, wives of the Sahabah included themselves in the address of the present verse and acted accordingly. Whenever they would visit any one's house, they used to seek permission. Sayyidah Umm Iyas ؓ has said ` We were four women who used to visit frequently Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ together, and used to seek permission before going in the house, and would enter only after she had permitted'. (Ibn Kathir on the authority of Ibn Abi Hatim)\nRuling\nIt is clear from the universality of this verse that on a visit to anyone's house the injunction of seeking permission is common to all, whether men or women, Mahram or non-Mahram. Either a woman goes to visit another woman, or a man goes to visit another man, it is obligatory on all to seek permission. Similarly, if a man visits his mother, sisters or any other Mahram woman, he should seek permission. Imam Malik (رح) has narrated in Muwatta' quoting ` Ata Ibn Yasar رحمۃ اللہ علیہم that someone enquired from the Holy Prophet ﷺ whether he should seek permission before going to his mother. He said ` Yes, do seek permission'. Then that fellow said '0 Messenger of Allah,\tI live with my mother in the same house'. He said even then you should not enter the house without taking permission. He asked again \"0 Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! ` I am always at her service'. He ﷺ replied, ` You should still ask her permission. Would you like that you see your mother naked? He said ` No, no'. Then the Holy Prophet ﷺ said ` It is for this reason that you should seek permission, because there is a possibility that she might have uncovered some of her coverable parts in the house for some need'. (Mazhari)\nOne learns from this Hadith that the word \"other than your own houses\" in the phrase غَيْرَ‌ بُيُوتِكُمْ (24:27) as it appears in the Qur’ an, refers to those houses where one lives alone and no one else, like parents, brothers or sisters reside with him. (It is only in this case that seeking permission is not necessary).\nRuling\nIf someone is living alone in the house with his wife, even then it is preferable and a sunnah to make some sort of sound, such as hem or thump, before entering, in order to make known his incoming, although seeking permission is not obligatory in this case. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Mas` ud's wife ؓ has reported that whenever ` Abdullah ؓ would come in the house, he would always make a hemming sound at the door to announce his arrival before entering, so that he should not see us in a condition that he would like to avoid. (Ibn Kathir quoting Ibn Jarir with an authentic chain). In another situation Ibn Juraij inquired from ` Ata (رح) whether it is obligatory to seek permission before going in one's own house to his wife, and he said ` no'. Ibn Kathir after quoting this version has explained that what it means is that it is not obligatory but preferable.\nThe Traditional way of seeking permission\nThe procedure for seeking permission, as explained in the verse is حَتَّىٰ تَسْتَأْنِسُوا وَتُسَلِّمُوا عَلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا (24:27) that is do not enter into any one's house until carrying out two things. First, Isti'nas - its literal meaning is to seek\nacquaintance. Majority of commentators have taken this word for isti'dhan, that is to take permission. By the use of word Isti'nas instead of isti'dhan there is a hint that in taking permission before entering, the host gets acquainted with the visitor through his voice and the element of surprise is removed. The second requirement is greeting the inmates of the house with salam. Some commentators have elaborated it as; one should first seek permission and on entering the house should greet the inmates. Qurtubi has also adopted this explanation that one should first seek permission, and when it is granted, only then go in and greet the hosts. Sayyidna Abu Ayyub Ansari's ؓ Hadith also corresponds well with this explanation, to which Mawardi has added further that if the visitor happens to see an inmate of the house before seeking permission, then he should first greet him, and then seek permission to go in, otherwise one should first seek permission and then greet on entering. But the procedure that seems to be masnun through narrations of Hadith, is that one should first greet from outside with Assalamu Alaikum ( السلام علیکم) and then by announcing big name should seek permission to go in.\nImam Bukhari (رح) in his al-Adab ul-Mufrad has quoted on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Huraira ؓ that if someone seeks permission before greeting, the host need not reply (because he has deviated from the practice adopted by the Holy Prophet\tﷺ) (Ruh al-Ma ani) Abu Dawud has narrated in his Hadith that someone from Bani ` Amir sought permission from the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، saying أألِجُ (that is, can I thrust in?). On hearing that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said to his servant, \"this man does not know how to seek permission. Go to him and explain to him that the permission should be sought by saying السلام علیکم أأدخل (that is, Assalamu` Alaikum, can I come in?). Before the servant could go out that fellow himself said 'Assalamu Alaikum السلام علیکم أأدخل as he had heard the instruction of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then he permitted him to come in. (Ibn Kathir)\nBaihaqi has narrated in Shu` ab-ul-'Iman on the authority of Sayyidna Jabir (رح) that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said لا تأذنوا لمن لم یبدأ بالسلام ، that is ` Do not let in the one who does not greet before seeking permission'. (Mazhari). In this case the Holy Prophet ﷺ has made two corrections. One, that one should greet first. Two, that he had used the word اَدخُلُ instead of اَلِجُ , which was not proper, because the word is derived from wuluj (وُلُوج) which means, to make an entry with force into a narrow space. This expression is against all ethics. In any case, one learns from these narrations that the instruction of greetings given in the Qur'anic verses relate to the greeting for seeking permission, which is offered from outside the house for inviting the attention of the inmates. On entering the house, the greetings should be repeated in the usual manner.\nRuling\nThe procedure of greeting first and then seeking permission for entry, as has been established by various Ahadith, can best be followed if the visitor himself announces his name for seeking permission. This was exactly the practice of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ . He used to announce at the door of the Holy Prophet ﷺ السّلام علی رسول اللہ، السلام علیکم أیدخل عمر ؟ that is, after the greetings whether Umar ؓ can come in. (Ibn Kathir etc.) Sahih of Muslim has narrated that Sayyidna Abu Musa al-Ash` ari ؓ went to see Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ and sought permission to get in by saying ھٰذا ابو موسٰی، السلام علیکم ھٰذا الاشعری (Qurtubi). First he gave his name as Abu Musa and then for further clarification added Ash'ari. This is to help the host recognize the caller immediately and respond quickly, for without recognizing the visitor the host may hesitate to give permission for getting in.\nRuling\nSome people adopt the worst possible practice in this regard that they ask permission from outside to come in without disclosing their identity. And when the host inquires as to who was there, they would answer ` It is me'. This is not the right answer to the host. If he has not recognized the voice on the first call, how can he recognize with the answer - ` it is me'.\nAl-Khatib a1-Baghdadi has reported in his Jami` quoting ` Ali Ibn 'Asim al-Wasiti that when he went to Basrah he went to see Sayyidna Mughira Ibn Shu'bah ؓ ، and knocked at his door. Sayyidna Mughirah ؓ inquired from inside as to who was there. He answered Ana (انا) that is It is me'. So, Sayyidna Mughirah ؓ said ` I do not have anyone among my friends by the name Ana' (انا). Then he went out and related the Hadith to him that one day Sayyidna Jabir Ibn ` Abdullah ؓ went to see the Holy Prophet ﷺ and knocked at his door. The Holy Prophet\tﷺ inquired from inside as to who was there, and Jabir said Ana (انا) that is It is me'. Then the Holy Prophet ﷺ repeated the words ` Ana Ana' (انا انا) to explain that there is no point in saying Ana, Ana, as no one can be recognized by this word.\nRuling\nThere is yet another very wrong practice which is commonly observed these days even by the educated people, and that is they would knock at the door and when the inmates would enquire from inside as to who was there, they do not reply at all and remain silent. This is the worst practice to tease the host, as he remains in suspense about the identity of the visitor, and the very spirit of seeking permission is defeated.\nRuling\nThis has also been established by these narrations that it is also a correct procedure of seeking permission to knock at the door, provided one tells his name at the same time.\nRuling\nIf one knocks at the door, it should not be so strong that the inmates get upset, rather it should be mild with the sole purpose of letting the inmates know that someone is at the door. Those who used to knock at the door of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، they used to knock with their nails in a manner that the sound should not be loud enough to disturb him. (As narrated by Al-Khatib in his Jami` - Qurtubi) If one understands the spirit behind isti'dhan that it is meant to seek permission with familiarization (isti'nas) of the caller, then automatically he would take care of all those things which could possibly trouble the host. at is required is to knock gently and announce the name for familiarization.\nImportant Warning\nThese days people do not pay any attention toward seeking permission, which is a clear sin for forsaking an obligation. But on the other hand there are some problems in our time for those who do want to take permission in the prescribed manner, that is first offer greetings from outside and then seek permission by announcing their name. One problem is that the host to whom they want their voice to reach is not available close to the door, hence it is difficult to convey to him the sound of greetings and the name of the caller. Therefore, the important thing to note is that the spirit of the injunction is not to enter anyone's house without permission. There may be different forms of seeking permission in different places in different times. One such form is to knock at the door, which is established by the record of Hadith. In the present time people fix up bells at their doors. It is sufficient for carrying out the obligation of seeking permission to press the button of the bell, provided the caller also announces his name after that in an audible voice for the host. Apart from this, it is also in order to adopt any other method of seeking permission in vogue at any place. The present day system of sending in visiting cards to disclose the identity of the caller is a good practice in that not only the name of the caller but also his address is made known to the host without any effort on his part, which fulfils the spirit behind isti'dhan. Therefore, there is no harm in adopting this system.",
