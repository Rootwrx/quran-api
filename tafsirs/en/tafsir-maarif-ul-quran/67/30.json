Obviously, the answer in negative.\nIt is recorded in a Tradition that when a person recites this verse, he should say اللہُ رَبُّ العَالَمِینَ \"Allah, the Lord of the worlds\" That is, it is Allah alone who can bring it back to us. None of us has the power.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Mulk\nEnds here",
