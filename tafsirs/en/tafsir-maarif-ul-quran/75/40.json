Can it be imagined that the Supreme Being in whose controlling power is death and life and the entire world is not able to bring the dead to life? The Holy Prophet is reported to have said: 'When anyone recites this verse of Surah Al-Qiyamah, he should say:\nبلی وانا علی ذالک من الشھدین۔ \"Yes indeed I am among those who bear witness\nthat He has the power to do it\"'. The same Hadith narrative states that\nwhen a person recites Surah Tin and reaches the verse اَلَيْسَ اللّٰهُ بِاَحْكَمِ الْحٰكِمِيْنَ 'Is Allah not the Greatest Ruler of all the rulers? [ 95:8] ', he should utter the same words. The same Hadith states that when a person recites Surah Al-Mursalat and reaches the verse U ;'Now, in which discourse, after this, will they believe? [ 77:50] ', he should say فَبِاَيِّ حَدِيْثٍۢ بَعْدَهٗ يُؤْمِنُوْنَ 'I believe in Allah'",
