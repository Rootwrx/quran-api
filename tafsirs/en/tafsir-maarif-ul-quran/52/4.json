  "text": "Al-Bait-ul-Ma` mur\nوَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ‌ (and by the Populated House [ AI-Bait-ul-Ma` mur ],...52:4) Al-Bait-ul-Ma` mur is the Ka'bah in the heaven meant for the angels' service and is parallel to the Ka'bah on earth. According to a Tradition in Sahihain that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said about his Ascension to the seventh heaven: \"Then, I was taken to Al-Bait-ul-Ma` mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again\" because every day other new angels take their turn to visit it. (Ibn Kathir)\nAl-Bait-ul-Ma` mur is the Ka'bah of the angels who reside in the seventh heaven. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ reached the seventh heaven on the Night of Ascension, he saw Holy Prophet Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) reclining with his back on Al-Bait-ul-Ma` mur. It was Holy Prophet Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) who built the Ka'bah on earth, and thus the reward is compatible with his action in that Allah Ta’ ala has blessed him with a special connection with Al-Bait-ul-Ma` mur (IbnKathir).",
