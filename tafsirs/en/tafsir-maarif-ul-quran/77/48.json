The verse signifies that when they were told to submit to the Divine commands, they refused to comply. Some scholars take the word ruku` in its technical sense and interpret the verse to signify 'when they are called to prayer, they refused to pray.' The ruku` is a part of the prayer, but it refers here to the whole prayer. [ Ruh ]",
