  "text": "1. i.e. after many people responded to the call of His prophets by accepting Islam.\nCommentary\nIn the previous verses, all the people of the whole world had been invited towards the original ` din' (religion) common between all the revealed Books and between all the prophets (علیہم السلام) ، and were advised to be faithful to it and be steadfast in it. But some infidels, who had no intention of listening and accepting, started arguing with the Muslims, even at this invitation. Some narrations have it that some people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians, put forward the argument that our prophet came before yours and our Book was given before yours, hence our religion is superior to yours. And some narrations have it that this very argument was put forward by the infidels of Quraysh, because they called themselves followers of the religion of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) .\nThe Noble Qur'an has warned these people that the explanations and proofs in favour of Islam and Qur'an have been fully provided to you, and your own sensible and fair minded people, having accepted them, have embraced Islam, and now their argumentation is nothing but falsehood and misguidance. If they do not accept it, then divine punishment will visit them. This warning is followed by the statement that the Qur'an is from Allah and contains comprehensive commandments regarding Allah's rights and the rights of the human beings between one another.",
