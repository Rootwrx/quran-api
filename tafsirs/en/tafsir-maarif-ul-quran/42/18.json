  "text": "This fact is stated in the next sentence, أَنزَلَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ وَالْمِيزَانَ \"has sent down the Book with truth and the Balance as well - 17.\" Here ` the Book' means the Qur'an, and all the previous revealed Books, and ` truth' means the divine religion mentioned above, and ` the Balance' literally means a weighing balance. Since it is an instrument of weighing one's due and establishing justice, Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has taken it to mean ` equity' and ` justice'. Mujahid (رح) leading exegete, has said that here the ` Balance' means full payment of everyone's rights and doing justice. As such the word ` truth' points towards Allah's rights over His servants, and the word مِیزَان mizan (Balance) points towards the rights of human beings over one another.\nThe statement that those who believe are fearful of the Doomsday means the fear generated due to cognizance of the awesome horrifying happenings which will take place on the Doomsday, and also due to cognizance of one's own short comings and wrong-doings. However, sometimes a believer's eagerness to meet his Lord Allah Almighty overcomes that fear, which does not contradict this statement; some dead ones are proved to have said in their graves that they wish Doomsday would come soon because the glad tidings given by angels that they would be forgiven and treated kindly, had overcome the fear of Doomsday.",
