Details have already been stated in the commentary of Surah Nisa'; the author has also given a complete list of major and minor sins in his booklet in Urdu published under the little of \"Gunah-e- bay ladhdhat گناہ بےلذّت .\nThe wisdom behind specially mentioning shameless acts, apart from all the other major sins, is that they are not only graver, but also infectious in that they influence others also. Shameless acts include adultery and the acts that precede it as preludes, and those bad deeds which are committed brazenly in public, because they corrupt the whole society and their liability is also very severe.\nThird virtue: وَإِذَا مَا غَضِبُوا هُمْ يَغْفِرُ‌ونَ (and when they get angry, they forgive - 37) This is a moral quality of the highest order, because when love and anger prevail upon someone, they make him blind and deaf, and he loses his ability to distinguish right from wrong, and true from false, rather, he cannot appreciate the results of his own actions. The one who is angry tries his utmost to vent his anger fully upon the one with whom he is angry. That is why Allah Ta’ ala has defined this quality of Mu'mins and virtuous persons that when they are angry, they not only maintain the limits of right and wrong, but also forgo their justified rights.",
