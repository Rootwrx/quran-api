  "text": "Commentary\nMentioned in the preceding verse was the incident of Sayyidna Zaid ؓ and Sayyidah Zainab ؓ and in relation to it the Holy Prophet's ﷺ being the last of the prophets has been stated in the context of directions for the respect and reverence of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and saving oneself from causing any pain to him.\nFurther on also, the perfect attributes of the Holy Prophet ﷺ are going to be stated; his person and attributes are the greatest blessings for Muslims in this world. The instruction of remembering Allah in abundance is given in the above verse to show gratitude for those blessings.\nSayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has stated that there is no form of worship except ذِکرُ اللہ dhikrullah (remembrance of Allah) for which Allah has not fixed a limit; for example, Salah is prescribed five times a day and the number of rak’ at are determined for each Salah; fasting throughout the month of Ramadan is determined, Hajj can be performed only at a particular place and at a particular time, Zakah is prescribed once a year at a particular rate. But dhikrullah is a form of worship for which there is no limit or defined quantity, no particular time or period, no defined posture or position, nor even the state of purity through ablution is required. Dhikrullah is required all the time, in all circumstances, whether one is traveling or is at home, whether one is healthy or ill, whether one is on land or at sea, whether it is day or night - dhikrullah is required all the time.\nTherefore no excuse is acceptable for neglecting dhikrullah except that one may have lost his senses and become unconscious. In case of all forms of worship, other than dhikrullah, if one becomes unable due to illness or compelling circumstances, one is allowed reduction, brevity or exemption altogether, but in case of dhikrullah there are no extenuating circumstances. Therefore, no excuse is considered valid for omitting it and the merits, blessings and rewards for doing it are also numerous.\nImam Ahmad (رح) has reported from Sayyidna Abu ad-Darda' ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said to the noble companions ؓ 'Should I not tell you a thing that is better than all your deeds and is most acceptable to your Lord, and which would raise your grades, and is better than giving silver and gold in charity and alms and is also better than your embarking for Jihad wherein you face and kill the enemy and the enemy kills you? The noble companions ؓ asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ about that thing. The Holy Prophet ﷺ said, ذِکرُ اللہِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ that is, remembrance of Allah, the Mightiest the Most Glorious\". (Ibn Kathir)\nImam Ahmad and Tirmidhi رحمۃ اللہ علیہما also have reported that Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ said that he had heard a prayer from the Holy Prophet ﷺ which he does never miss. It is the following:\nاللَّھُمَّ اَجعَلنِی اُعَظِّمُ شُکرِکَ وَ اَتَّبِعُ نَصِیحَتَکَ وَ اُکثِرُ ذِکرِکَ وَ احفَظُ وَصِیَّتِکَ\n\"0 Allah make me so that I keep thanking You profusely, I keep obeying your instructions, I keep remembering You abundantly and I safeguard (to follow) your advice.\" (Ibn Kathir)\nHere the Holy Prophet ﷺ has supplicated to Allah Ta’ ala for ability to engage in dhikrullah abundantly.\nA Beduin said to the Holy Prophet ﷺ that the number of good deeds, obligations in Islam are many; so please tell me something concise and comprehensive which I could hold on to firmly. The Holy Prophet ﷺ told him,\nلَا یَزَالُ لِسَانُکَ رَطباً بِذِکرِ اللہِ تعالیٰ\nThat your tongue remains always wet with the dhikr of Allah. (Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Kathir)\nSayyidna Abu Said ؓ has narrated that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has said اُذکُرُو اللہَ تَعَالٰی حَتّٰی یقُولُوا مَجنُونُ \"Remember Allah, the Almighty so much so that people start calling you crazy.\" (Ibn Kathir from Musnad Ahmad)\nAnd Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ has narrated that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has said that a gathering of people wherein Allah is not mentioned would prove to be a matter of remorse on the Doomsday for those sitting therein.
