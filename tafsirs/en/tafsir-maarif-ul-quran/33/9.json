  "text": "Commentary\nAt the beginning of the Surah, by saying: وَ اتَّبع مَا یُوحٰٓی اِلَیکَ , the Holy Prophet ﷺ was asked to follow the Divine revelation sent to him. Then, in the previous verse: اَلنَّبِیُّ اَولٰی بِالمُؤمِنِینَ , the believers have been obligated with the implementation of the orders of the recipient of the revelation. It is to further confirm and emphasize these very two things that, in the present two verses as well, the same two subjects have been reiterated, that is, the recipient of the revelation has been obligated to follow the revelation received by him from Allah and the non-recipient of the revelation has been obligated to follow the recipient of the revelation.\nThe Covenant of the Prophets\nThe covenant taken from the blessed prophets, according to the cited verse, is in addition to the universal pledge taken from the entire creation as it appears in a saying of the Holy Prophet\tﷺ reported by Imam Ahmad (رح) :\nخُصُّوا بِمِیثاقِ الرِّسَالۃَ وَ النُّبُوَّوۃِ وَ وھُوَ قَولُہ، تَعَالٰی وَ اِذ اَخَذنَا مِنَ النَّبِیّٖن مِیثاقَھُم\n\"It was the prophets only from whom the covenant of messenger-ship and prophethood was taken, and this is the meaning of what Allah Ta’ ala has said: .... (And when We took from the prophets their covenant...to the end of the verse).\nThis pledge from the prophets was the pledge of discharging the duties of prophethood and messenger-ship and of attesting to the veracity of each other and of being mutually helpful - as Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim and others have reported from Sayyidna Qatadah ؓ . And according to one narration, it was also included in this pledge of the prophets that they should also proclaim that \"Sayyidna Muhammad al-Mustafa ﷺ is the messenger of Allah, and the last of the prophets. After him, there will be no prophet [مُحَمَّدُ رَّسُولُ اللہِ لَا نَبِّی بَعدَہ،]\nAnd this pledge from prophets was also taken in eternity (Azal) at the same time when the pledge of: اَلَستُ بِرَبِّکُم (alastu bi-rabbikum: Am I not your Lord?) was taken from the created at large. (Ruh a1-Ma’ ani and Mazhari)\nAfter having generally mentioned prophets, peace be on them all, before saying: ومِنکَ وَ مِن نُّوح (and from you and from Nuh... up to the end of the verse), five of them were particularly named on the basis of the unique distinction they have among the group of prophets. Then, even within those, it was by using the word: مِنکَ (minka: from you) that the mention of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was made to precede that of others - although, his appearance in this world is later than all of them. The reason for this has been given in Hadith itself:\nکُنتُ اَوَّلَ النَّاسِ فِی الخَلقِ وَ اٰخِرَھُم فِی البَعثِ (رواہ ابن سعد وابو نعیم فی الحلیۃ عن میسرۃ الفجر و الطبرانی فی الکبیر عن ابن عباس ؓ ۔ مظھری)\n'I am the first human being in the creation and the last of them in being sent (with the prophetic mission).' (Reported by Ibn Sa'd and Abu Nu'aim in Al-Hilyah from Maisirah al-Mafjar and At-Tabarani in al-Kabir from Ibn ` Abbas ؓ - Mazhari)",
