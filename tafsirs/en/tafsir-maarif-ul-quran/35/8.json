  "text": "Imam al-Baghawi has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that the verse: فَإِنَّ اللَّـهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَاءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ (The fact, therefore, is that Allah lets go astray whomsoever He wills , and leads to the right path whomsoever He wills.- 8) was revealed at a time when the Holy Prophet ﷺ had made the prayer: '0 Allah, bless Islam with prestige and power, through ` Umar Ibn al-Khattab, or Abu Jahl.' Out of the two, Allah Ta’ ala showed the right path to Sayyidna 'Umar ؓ and made him the cause of Islam's prestige and power, while Abu Jahl remained as astray as he was. (Mazhari)",
