He is saying that this has nothing to do with the art of divination through computation of figures and lines (Um al-jafr and 'am al-raml - not Jafar and Ramal, soothsaying or any other occult act of conjuring). Instead of all that, this is what my Rabb tells me - and I pass on the information. And this was an open miracle which is proof positive of prophethood and a major cause of confidence.",
