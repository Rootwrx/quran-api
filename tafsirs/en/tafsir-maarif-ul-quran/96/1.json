  "text": "Beginning of The Qur’ anic Revelation\nIt is universally agreed that the first five verses of Surah Al-` Alaq or Iqra' mark the very beginning of Qur’ anic revelation. [ Baghawi ]. Bukhari, Muslim, other authentic sources and overwhelming consensus of scholars, ancient and modern, all concur on this point. However, some scholars state that Surah Al-Muddaththir was the first Surah to be revealed, and yet others say that Surah Al-Fatihah [ The Opening ] was revealed first. It is possible to reconcile between these different views as follows: After the revelation of Surah Al-` Alaq or Iqra', there was a temporary break in the revelation during which the Holy Prophet used to be very sad, but after some time, the Angel Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) appeared to him once again, and he faced the same situation as he faced when the first verses of Surah Iqra' were revealed to him. On this occasion, the opening verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir were conveyed to him by the angel. From this point of view, it may be said that the first Surah to be revealed after the temporary break was Surah Al-Muddaththir. Some of the Companions held the view that Surah Al-Fatihah was the first Surah to be revealed. They probably meant to say that this was the first Surah to be revealed in a complete form. Undoubtedly, some verses (of Surahs Al-` Alaq or Iqra', Al-Muzzammil and Al-Muddaththir) were revealed earlier, but the rest of the verses of those Surahs were revealed at later dates. Al-Fatihah is the first Surah that was revealed to the Holy Prophet ﷺ in its entirety, all seven verses at once. [ Mazhari ]\nThe Holy Prophet's ﷺ First Experience of Revelation\nIn a lengthy narration, as recorded in the Sahihs of Bukhari and Muslim, the Mother of the Faithful, Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ says that revelation to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was started by true dreams. Whatever he saw in a dream would happen in reality as clearly as the light of dawn. Then solitude became dear to him, and he used to seclude himself for worship in the cave Ha', (a cave in the mount known today as 'Jabal-un-Nur, which is clearly visible in front of Jannat-ul-Ma` la, the famous graveyard of Makkah) and therein he devoted himself to Divine worship for several nights before he came back to his family and took provisions for his retirement; then he would return to the Mother of the Faithful, Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ and take more provisions for a similar period. (The period of his stay in the cave is mentioned differently by different reports, but the report of sahihain maintains that it was a month, the whole month of Ramadan. Authentic traditions are silent about the mode of worship he adopted during this period. Some scholars have opined that he used to worship according to the Shari` ah of Nuh, Ibrahim and ` Isa (علیہم السلام) but neither any authentic report supports it, nor is it likely, because he was an 'ummiyy (unlettered). It is, therefore, more likely that his worship was concentration and reflection on Allah Almighty and His omnipotence until the Truth, that is, the revelation came to him while he was in the cave of Hira'; so the angel came to him and said, اِقرَا 'Read'. The Holy Prophet replied, ما انا بقاری 'I am not the one who can read'. (The Holy Prophet\twas under the impression that he was directing him to read a written document. Since the Holy Prophet ﷺ could not read or write, he replied accordingly.) Then the angel embraced him and pressed him so hard that he felt extreme pain, then he released him and said, اِقرَا 'Read'. The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied, 'I am not the one who can read'. Then he embraced him and pressed him a second time so hard that he felt extreme pain, then he released him again and said, اِقرَا 'Read'. The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied ما انا بقاری ، 'I am not the one who can read'. Then he embraced the Holy Prophet\tﷺ and pressed him a third time, then he released him and said,\nاقْرَ‌أْ بِاسْمِ رَ‌بِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ ﴿1﴾ خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ ﴿2﴾ اقْرَ‌أْ وَرَ‌بُّكَ الْأَكْرَ‌مُ ﴿3﴾ الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ ﴿4﴾ عَلَّمَ الْإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ ﴿5﴾\n'Read with the Name of your Lord Who created [ everything ], He created man from a clot of blood. Read, and your Lord is the most gracious, who imparted knowledge by means of the Pen. He taught man what he did not know.'\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned with this message [ of five verses ] while his heart trembled and he came to Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ saying زمّلونی زمّلونی 'wrap me up, wrap me up', and she wrapped him up, until the awe left him. (It should be noted that the fear felt by the Holy Prophet ﷺ was due to the great responsibility delegated to him, and due to the unusual event of seeing an angel in his original form.)\nThen he said to Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ عنہا\twhile he related to her what had happened: \"I feared for myself.\" Sayyidah Khadijah \t ؓ said: 'Nay, by Allah, Allah will never expose you to disgrace, because you unite the ties of kinship, and bear the burden of the weak, and earn for the destitute, and offer hospitality to the guests, and help (people) in real distress.'\nThen Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ took him to her cousin, Waraqah Ibn Naufal. He was a man who had adopted Christianity (which was a true religion at that time) during the days of Ignorance, and he used to write the Hebrew script, and translate it into Arabic. He was a very old man who had turned blind. Sayyidah Khadijah ؓ said to him, 0 Uncle's son! Listen to your brother's son. Waraqah asked him, My brother's son! What have you seen? So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ related to him what he had seen. Waraqah said to him, This is the very same confidant [ angel Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) ] whom Allah sent to Holy Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) ; would that I were a young man at this time - would that I were alive when your people would expel you! The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked in surprise, Will they expel me?\" He replied. Yes; never has a man appeared with the like of that which you have brought, but he has been held in enmity; and if your time finds me alive, I shall help you with the fullest support. After that, not much time had passed before Waraqah died, and the revelation broke off temporarily. [ Bukhari and Muslim ]\nThe temporary break of revelation, according to Suhaili, lasted for about a year and half. Other reports say that it lasted to about three years. [ Mazhari ]\nVerse [ 1] اقْرَ‌أْ بِاسْمِ رَ‌بِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ (Read with the Name of your Lord, Who created [ everything ]) In the prepositional phrase bismi rabbika [ with the name of your Lord ], the addition of the word ismi is significant in two ways [ 1] that whenever the Qur'an is being recited, the reader should begin by reciting the formula\t, بسم اللہ الرحمٰن الرحیم \"With the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful\". When Jibra'il Amin (علیہ السلام) suddenly appeared to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and said 'iqra' (read) , he tendered apology that he is unable to read or recite, because he is unlettered. The phrase b-ismi rabbika points to the fact that under present circumstances you, 0 Holy Prophet ﷺ ، may be 'ummiyy' or unlettered, but Allah has the power to grant you the highest level of knowledge, the most elegant style of oration and eloquence, so that you would surpass and subdue the most educated or literate people, as it became manifest later on. [ Mazhari ]. [ 2] Allah has many Beautiful Names, but the blessed name rabb is particularly chosen in the verse here probably because it supports and emphasizes the theme that Allah cherishes and sustains the Holy Prophet through all the different stages of his development, until he is fully consummated. He can make him read and recite, despite being unlettered. In the relative clause al-ladhi khalaqa [ Who created ], particularly contains the Divine attribute of takhliq [ creating ] presumably because the first Divine favor is wujud or 'existence' as a result of His drawing out beings from the realm of non-existence into the realm of existence. Many other favors of His follow. The verb khalaqa [ created ] is transitive and it requires an object that is absent here. This indicates the verb is used absolutely, and it signifies that the Creator has created the entire universe and every existent thing it contains.",
