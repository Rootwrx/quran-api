It includes the words of disbelief, futile or idle talk, obscene language, calumny or false accusation, or any other talk that hurts people's feelings. On another occasion, the Qur'an puts it thus:\nلَا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا تَأْثِيمًا\n'They will hear neither an absurd talk therein, nor something leading to sin, [ 56:25]\nThis shows that false accusation and absurd talks are hurtful. That is why the Holy Qur'an has described it as a blessing to the inmates of Paradise that no such foolish words will come across their ears that may pollute their hearts.",
