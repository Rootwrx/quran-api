When the preceding verse was revealed in which it was stated that the inmates of Hell will get food like Dari`, some of the pagans of Makkah [ mockingly ] said that their camels eat Dari` and yet they are fat and healthy. In response to their statement, the following verse of the Qur'an was revealed which means that they should not compare the Dari` of this world with that of the Hereafter. The latter will neither provide nutrition, nor satisfy their hunger.",
