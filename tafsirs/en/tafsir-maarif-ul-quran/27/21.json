Punishing animals, other than domestic, is not permissible under Islamic law. (Qurtubi)\nأَوْ لَيَأْتِيَنِّي بِسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ\nUnless he brings to me a clear plea. - 27:21\nThat is, if the hoopoe offers a plausible excuse for its absence, then it will be saved from the punishment. There is a subtle hint in it that it is expected of a ruler or an administrator that if someone falters doing something, then it should be thoroughly investigated before punishing him. The punishment should be enforced only when the guilt is established, otherwise he should be forgiven.",
