  "text": "Commentary\nلِمَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ (why do you seek evil to come sooner before good? - 27:46). Sayyidna Salih (علیہ السلام) is referring here to the demand of the infidels that he should bring the divine torment to them in this world, so that they may know his truthfulness. Therefore, \"evil\" in this sentence stands for torment, while \"good\" refers to their repentance and invoking divine mercy. It, therefore means, \"Why are you asking me to bring the divine punishment before you repent?\"",
