  "text": "The Torah تورات had in several places foretold the coming of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . In fact, the Jews themselves used to tell the Arabs that a new prophet and a new Divine Book was soon to come. But when the Holy Qur'an came down from Allah, and even when they had recognized its authenticity, the Jews denied it out of sheer spite.\nThe verse says that the Holy Qur'an confirms the Torah تورات it means that the Holy Qur'an is a concrete evidence of the truth of the prophecies made in the Torah تورات with regard to the coming of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and of the Holy Qur'an. One who believes in the Torah \tتورات cannot justifiably deny the Holy Qur'an and the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، for such a denial would involve a denial of the Torah تورات itself.\nKnowledge is not enough for 'Iman ایمان\nOne may want to know why the Holy Qur'an calls the Jews Kafirin کافرون (infidels), when they did recognize the truth as truth, which should qualify them to be called \"believers.\" Let us explain that 'Iman ایمان (faith) does not merely mean \"knowing the truth\", but really signifies \"accepting the truth and affirming it deed-wise.\" Otherwise, Satan too will have to be called a believer, for he knows fully well what the truth is. In fact, this knowledge of the truth on the part of Satan شیطان intensifies the gravity of his Kufr کفر (infidelity) all the more.\nHowever, the next verse attributes the infidelity of the Jews to their malice.",
