Verse 274: الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُم بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ‌ \"Those who spend their\nwealth night and day.\"\nPresented in this verse is the great reward and excellence of those who are used to spending in the way of Allah. They are those who, under all conditions and circumstances, during the day and during the night, secretly and openly, keep spending in the way of Allah in all sorts of ways. By implication, it was also stated that there is no time fixed for charities, i.e., sadaqah صدقہ and khayrat خیرات . There is no restriction of night or day. Similarly, spending in the way of Allah, secretly and openly, is an act of thawab ثواب both ways, however, the condition is that it should be done with sincerity (ikhlas اخلاص ), and not to earn name and fame. The excellence of spending secretly is limited to a situation where there be no pressing need to spend out openly; and where such a need does exist, spending there openly is certainly better.\nBased on the authority of Ibn ` Asakir, there is a report in Ruh al-Ma` ani which says that Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ spent forty thousand dinars in the way of Allah - making it ten thousand during the day, ten thousand during the night, ten thousand openly and ten thousand secretly. Some commentators have said that this very event related to Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ was the background of the revelation of this verse. There are other views also regarding the circumstances of its revelation.",
