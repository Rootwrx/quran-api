  "text": "(7). Verse 273: لِلْفُقَرَ‌اءِ الَّذِينَ أُحْصِرُ‌وا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّـهِ (الی قولہ) فَإِنَّ اللَّـهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ\"For the\nneedy who are confined in the way of Allah ... Allah is All-Aware of it”.\nHere the word, al-fugara الفقراء ' (the needy: those who need support for their physical sustenance) covers all those who cannot engage themselves in other jobs because of their religious preoccupation.\nيَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَاءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ : \"An ignorant person takes them to be rich on account of their abstinence.\"\nThis verse tells us that a faqir فقیر (the one who does not own the nisab نصاب of زکاۃ Zakah) wearing expensive dress will not be taken as 'need-free' because of that. Instead, he would be regarded as faqir فقیر . Paying زکاۃ Zakah to such a person will be correct. (Qurtubi)\nتَعْرِ‌فُهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ \"You know them by their appearance.\"\nThis tells us that it is correct to give rulings based on circumstantial evidence. For instance, if a dead body is found wearing zunnar (waist-cord which is a symbol of some pagan religions), and is uncircumcised, it will not be buried in the graveyard of Muslims. (Qurtubi)\nلَا يَسْأَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا :\"They do not beg people importunately.\"\nOn the surface, this verse gives the sense that they do not solicit importunately but it does not negate soliciting without importunity, as is the actual interpretation of some commentators. But, in accordance with the consensus of commentators, it means that they just do not ask; لاَنھم متعففون عن المساَلہ عفۃ تامۃ (totally refrain from asking) (Qurtubi).",
