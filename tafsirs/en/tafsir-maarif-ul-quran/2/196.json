  "text": "Injunctions concerning Hajj and ` Umrah\nIn the series of injunctions appearing under the theme of 'righteousness' which has started from verse 177, the eleventh injunction relates to the Hajj. Since it is tied to Makkah al-Mukarramah and Ka'bah, the House of Allah, therefore, some relevant questions have been covered partly under the subject of Qiblah قبلہ from verse 125 to 128 of Surah al-Baqarah. They begin from وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً and end, at وَأَرِ‌نَا مَنَاسِكَنَا ، then, at the conclusion of the discussion on Qiblah, the injunction of Sa` y سَعِی between Said and Marwah has been taken up in verse 158, إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْ‌وَةَ as a corollary. Now, Verse 196 - 203, from وَأَتِمُّوا الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَ‌ةَ to, the eight consecutive verses, present injunctions and questions about Hajj and ` Umrah.\nThe Hajj, with the strong consensus of the entire Muslim Ummah, is a pillar among the cardinal pillars of Islam and an important obligation. It has been clearly emphasised in the many verses of the Holy Qur'an and in numerous authentic ahadith.\nAccording to the majority opinion, the Hajj became an obligation in the third year of Hijrah, that is, in the year the battle of Uhud was fought, through the verse وَلِلَّـهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ (and as a right of Allah, it is obligatory on the people to perform Hajj of the House) of Surah Al ` Imran آلِ عمران (Ibn Kathir). In this verse, conditions of the obligation of Hajj have been stated and a stern warning has been given to those who do not perform Hajj in spite of having the ability to do that.\nOut of the eight verses before us, the first verse وَأَتِمُّوا الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَ‌ةَ (And accomplish the Hajj, and the ` Umrah for Allah) was revealed, as agreed upon by the commentators, pertaining to the event of Hudaybiyyah حدیبیہ which took place in the year 7 A.H. This tells us that the purpose of the verse is not to declare the initial obligation of the Hajj; that has been stated already. Instead, the intention here is to convey some special injunctions governing Hajj and ` Umrah.\nThe Injunction about ` Umrah\nHowever, Surah Al ` Imran which declares Hajj as an obligation restricts itself to Hajj alone; ` Umrah عمرہ is not mentioned there, while the present verse mentions ` Umrah, but does not state whether it is basically 'necessary' or 'obligatory'. It rather says that a person who begins Hajj or ` Umrah by going into Ihram, then, it becomes wajib or necessary for him to complete that, very much like voluntary prayers or fasting where the rule is that after one starts them, their completion becomes necessary. Therefore, we do not find out from this verse the answer to the question: Is ` Umrah wajib, or is it not? It simply tells us that once one starts it, it becomes wajib or necessary for him to complete it.\nIbn Kathir cites, with reference to al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi, a report from the blessed Companion Jabir that he asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : 'Is ` Umrah wajib?' He said: 'Well, not wajib, but that you do it is better and merit worthy.' (According to al-Tirmidhi, this hadith is hasan sahih). This is why Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and others say that ` Umrah is not wajib, but a sunnah. Looking back at the statement in the present verse that completing Hajj and ` Umrah after one has gone into Ihram becomes wajib or necessary, we face the question as to what happens if, after entering into the state of Ihram, there comes up some sort of compulsion which -makes it impossible to complete the Hajj and ` Umrah. at has to be done in such cases has been clarified in the succeeding sentence which begins with \"but if you are restricted.\"\nRules concerning Ihram احرام\nAs this verse pertains to the event of Hudaybiyyah where the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his Companions ؓ were in a state of Ihram and the disbelievers of Makkah had stopped them from entering Makkah and performing ` Umrah, thereupon came the injunction that the fidyah or ransom to get released from the Ihram is to offer the sacrifice of an animal, such as, a goat, cow or camel whichever is easy to get. After the sacrifice has been offered, Warn can be removed, but within the next sentence وَلَا تَحْلِقُوا رُ‌ءُوسَكُمْ : (And shave not your heads) it has also been pointed out that removing the Ihram, which is legally possible only after having shaved or close-trimmed the hair on the head, is not permissible until the sacrificial animal of the person in a state of Ihram reaches its destined spot and is actually slaughtered.\nThe expression 'reaching its place', according to Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) ، means that it should be taken into the sacred precincts of the Haram and slaughtered there. If one cannot do it personally, he can authorise someone else to do it on his behalf. The situation of being 'restricted' by an enemy is clearly mentioned in this verse. Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) and some other jurists are of the view that if somebody is unable to complete Hajj or ` Umrah (after wearing Ihram احرام ) because of sickness, he can also avail of the concession given by this verse, because the words if you are restricted' are so general that they include the restriction imposed by sickness also.\nThe manner in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ has practiced the instructions given in the Holy Verse is sufficient to disclose that although it is allowed in such an emergent situation to remove the Ihram after offering a sacrifice, yet it will remaih obligatory to perform the Hajj or the 'Umrah afresh as a qada' قضاء (whenever the circumstances allow to do so). That is why the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his Companions did perform the ` Umrah next year as a qada' قضاء for the ` Umrah missed by them at Hudaybiyyah.\nIn this verse, the shaving of the head has been indentified as the signal for removing the Ihram which proves that shaving the head (halq حلق) or trimming the hair qasr قصر) in a state of Ihram is forbidden. In view of this, the next injunction tells us the way out for one who faces a compelling need to shave his head in a state of Ihram.\nShaving in the state of Ihram احرام ?\nIn the text of the Holy Qur'an, it is said: فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِ‌يضًا أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّ‌أْسِهِ that is, if one is forced to shave hair on the head, or any other part of the body, because of some ailment or irritating lice, one can do so in proportion to the need, but it has to be redeemed by giving fidyah فدیہ in the form of fasting, charity or sacrifice. The place for sacrifice is fixed; it has to be offered within the limits of Haram حرم . There is no such fixed place for fasting and charity; these obligations can be accomplished anywhere. The number of fasts and the amount of charity find no mention in the words of the Holy Qur'an, but in a hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari, the Holy Prophet ﷺ prescribed in a similar situation faced by the noble Companion Ka'b ibn ` Ujrah ؓ that he should fast for three days or give 1/2 sa' of wheat as charity to six needy persons. This 1/2 sa` comes to approximately 1.632 kilograms of wheat or its price in cash.\nCombining Hajj and ` Umrah during Hajj months\nBefore the appearance of Islam, the Arabs in Jahiliyyah would not combine Hajj and ` Umrah during Hajj months, that is, after the advent of Shawwal. They thought it was a sin. Towards the end of this verse, their misconception was corrected by restricting the prohibition on combining Hajj and ` Umrah during the months of Hajj to only those who live within the limits of Miqat because it is not difficult for them to return for ` Umrah after the Hajj months. But, for those coming from outside the Miqat میقات limits, it was declared permissible because it is not easy for them to make a special trip exclusively for ` Umrah all the way from such distances. Miqat is one of the several stations appointed by Allah Almighty on every route leading to Makkah from all over the world and it has been made obligatory on everyone proceeding to Makkah to wear Ihram at this point to perform Hajj or ` Umrah. Going beyond this appointed place without Ihram is a sin. The verse لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِ‌ي الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَ‌امِ means just this, that is, combining Hajj and ` Umrah is permissible only for a person whose family does not live within the environs of al-Masjid al-Haram, or in other words, within the limits of the appointed stations known as Miqat میقات .\nHowever, those who combine the Hajj and ` Umrah during the Hajj months are obligated to demonstrate their gratefulness for having been allowed to combine two acts of ` Ibadah. This gratitude is expressed by offering a sacrifice, if one is capable of that. This sacrifice may be offered by slaughtering a goat, cow or camel whichever is easy. But, one who is financially incapable of doing so, he is obligated to fast for ten days, the first three within the Hajj days completing them by the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah, the rest of seven fasts he can complete after the Hajj at a place and time of his choice. He could do so while living in Makkah or when.he returns home. If a person fails to fast for three days during the Hajj days, for him, in the view of revered Companions, and Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) ، offering a sacrifice is mandatory. As soon as it is possible, he can have the sacrifice offered in the Haram through someone he knows (Jassas).\nAl-Tamattu` التمتع and Al-Qirn القرن ; the two kinds of Hajj\nCombining the Hajj and ` Urnrah during Hajj days takes two forms. The first method is to enter into Ihram for Hajj and ` Umrah both right from the Miqat. This is known as Al-Qirn القرن in the terminology of hadith. Under this method the release from the Ihram is tied with the release from the Ihram of Hajj. The pilgrim has to stay in a state of Ihram until the last day of Hajj. Under the second method it is possible to enter into Ihram exclusively for ` Umrah from a Miqat and after reaching Makkah al-Mukarramah, and performing the fixed rites of ` Umrah one can get out of the Ihram. After that, when getting ready to go to Mina on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah, he should enter again into the Ihram of Hajj right within the Haram. This is technically known as Al-Tamattu`. Literally, the word Tamattu' covers both methods since it means to have the benefit of combining Hajj and ` Umrah both' which is equally applicable to both the methods detailed above. The words' فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ (Then, whoever avails of the advantage) in the present verse of the Holy Qur'an have been used in this general sense.\nThe warning against violation of rules\nThe verse 196 ends up with the words 'Fear Allah' which is a command to adopt Taqwa تقویٰ - a Qur'anic term which has no equivalent in the English language, and denotes the attitude of fearing and abstaining from doing anything against rules set by Allah Almighty. This command has been followed by a warning: وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّـهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ (and be aware that Allah is severe at punishment) which means that anyone who knowingly acts against the injunctions revealed by Allah Almighty, for him the punishment of Allah is severe. The people who go in our days for Hajj or ` Umrah are widely negligent of this warning. To begin with, they do not make the necessary effort to find out the rules of Hajj and 'Umrah. Then a good many do not follow the rules strictly, even if they have the knowledge. Bad guides or careless fellow pilgrims sometimes make one miss the obligatory acts, let alone the sunnah and the proper etiquette of the pilgrimage. May Allah bless all of us with the ability to correct what we do.",
