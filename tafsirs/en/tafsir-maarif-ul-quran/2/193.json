  "text": "Commentary\n1.\tWhen the Holy Prophet decided to travel to Makkah in the year 7 A.H. to perform his qada\"Umrah as envisaged in the peace treaty of Hudaybiyyah; his Companions ؓ who were to accompany him knew that disbelievers could not be trusted with treaties, or peace. It was quite possible that they may start fighting. Now, the blessed Companions had a problem before them. They thought if this fighting came, it would have to be within the sacred precincts of Makkah, which is not permissible in Islam. This doubt was answered in Verse 191 by stating that the sanctity of the sacred precincts of Makkah must certainly be observed by Muslims, but should the disbelievers start to fight within the sacred limits, then, it is permissible for them to fight back in defence.\n2.\tThe second problem that bothered the noble Companions was about the month, which was Dhul-Qa'dah ذوالقعدہ ، being one of the four known as the 'sacred months' wherein fighting anyone anywhere was not permissible. Now, the Muslims thought if the disbelievers of Makkah started fighting against them how could Muslims fight a defensive battle during a 'sacred month'? The verse under reference (194) was revealed to answer this doubt. The answer is that, the way a state of defence grants an exception to observing the sanctity of the Haram of Makkah, in the same manner, it allows an exception to observing the sanctity of the 'sacred months' also.",
