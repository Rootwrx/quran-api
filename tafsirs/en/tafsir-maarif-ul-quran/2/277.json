Since, in the verse previous to this, the punishment of Hell and the disgrace the consumers of ربا riba will be facing was mentioned, so in accordance with the general style of the noble Qur'an, the merit - in آخرۃ Akhirah - of the believing-practising Muslims, those steadfast in Salah نماز and زکاۃ Zakah, was mentioned alongside.",
