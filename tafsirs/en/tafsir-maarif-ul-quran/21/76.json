As for the prayer of Nuh علیہ السلام\twhich is referred to here briefly, the version given in Surah Nuh is that Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) had cursed his people, رَّ‌بِّ لَا تَذَرْ‌ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ مِنَ الْكَافِرِ‌ينَ دَيَّارً‌ا (My Lord, leave not upon the earth of the unbelievers even one - 71:26). It is reported at another place that when the people of Nuh (علیہ السلام) did not listen to him at all, he prayed to Allah Ta` ala أَنِّي مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ‌ (I am vanquished; do Thou succour me! - 54:10) so You take revenge from them.\nفَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ مِنَ الْكَرْ‌بِ الْعَظِيمِ (So, We responded to him and saved him and his family from the terrible agony - 21:76) Here the expression 'terrible agony' either refers to the drowning in the deluge which annihilated the entire people or the torture which he and his followers suffered at the hands of those people.",
