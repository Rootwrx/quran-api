Syrian land abounds both inwards and outwards bounties of Allah Ta ala. Inward bounties in the sense that many prophets were born in this land, and outward bounty in the sense that it has a moderate climate and is full of natural beauty with greenery, springs and streams all around and sustains a large variety of vegetation, fruits and flowers.",
