The letters 'RJZ' may be read as rujz or rUz, and in either case the word has the same significance.\nMujahid, ` Ikramah, Qatadah, Zuhri, Ibn Zaid and other leading authorities of Tafsir interpret the word rujz as 'idols' in this context. According to a narration of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas, it signifies 'any sin'. The verse enjoins to give up idols or sins. Although the Holy Prophet\nnever indulged in idolatry at any time in his life, he is commanded, for emphasis, to abstain from it in future as he kept away from it in the past. This command is in actual fact directed to the idolaters, so that they may realise the importance of abstaining from idol-worship, as it enjoins the Holy Prophet to shun all filth [ idols and sins ] despite being sinless and infallible.",
