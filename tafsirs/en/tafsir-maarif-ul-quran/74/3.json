  "text": "Injunction [ 2]\nوَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ (..and pronounce the greatness of your Lord...74:3) It means: \"Proclaim the greatness of your Lord both orally and practically. The attribute rabb (Lord) has been used in this context because it is itself the effective cause of the injunction, in that He is the Sustainer, Cherisher and Nourisher of the entire world. He alone is worthy of Kibriya'. The word takbtr literally signifies 'to say Allahu Akbar '. This includes takbir of tahrimah in the beginning of prayers and other takbirs also. Takbir is recited outside the prayers as well, such as in adhan and iqamah. There is no indication in the Qur'an that this injunction specifically refers to uttering Allahu Akbar to commence the prayers.",
