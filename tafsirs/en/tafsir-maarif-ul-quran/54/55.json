In the prepositional phrase bi-qadar, the word qadar literally denotes to 'measure' and to create something with a proper measure and proportion. It is possible for this literal sense of the word to apply in the current verse: Allah is the Supreme Sage Who created every species of the existent entity wisely with proper measurement - whether big or small, and in different shapes and sizes. Having created, He maintains the structure of every individual in a very wise measurement: The fingers and toes are not equal in size; the lengths are different; the length and breadth of hands and legs are wisely structured; and their bones, muscles and skins are created flexible to stretch and contract. When we analyze every single part of every single limb and organ of [ human ] body, we discern the wondrous vistas of Divine wisdom opening up.\nAs a theological term, qadar is used in the sense of taqdir [ Divine predetermination, predestination, preordainment, preordering or decree ]. Most authorities on Tafsir, on account of some versions of hadith, take the word qadar here in this sense. It is recorded in Musnad of Ahmad, Sahib Muslim and Tirmidhi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that once the pagans of Quraish came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ debating and arguing with him on the question of taqdir (Predestination). On that occasion this verse was revealed. In the light of this tradition, the verse purports to say that Allah has predetermined the total sum of everything. He created everything with predestined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred, and recorded everything [ time and place, growth and decline ] that will occur, before they occurred. Everything that occurs in this world; occurs according to the Divine Plan worked out in Pre-Eternity or Eternity-without-Beginning.\nThe question of taqdir, according to Ahl-us-sunnah wal jama` ah, is one of the affirmed and standard articles of faith in Islam. Anyone who denies it outright is an atheist or goes out of the pale Islam, and the sects that deny it by convoluted or twisted interpretation are fasiq in [ sinners or transgressors ]. Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Tabarani record a Tradition on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ that the Holy Messenger ﷺ said: \"Some members of every community are Magians, and the Magians of my Ummah are those who deny taqdir. If they fall ill, do not visit them; and if they die, do not attend their funerals.\" (Ruh al-Ma’ ani) Allah, the Pure and Exalted, knows best!\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Qamar\nEnds here",
