  "text": "The Fifth Bequest of Luqman about Social Manners\nIn verse 18, it was said: وَلَا تُصَعِّرْ‌ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ (And do not turn your cheek away from people). The expression: لَا تُصَعِّرْ‌ (la tusa\"ir) is a derivation from: صَعَرَ (sa’ ara) which is a disease among camels that causes a tilt in the neck similar to the stroke among human beings that makes the face become crooked. It carries the sense of turning one's face away (in disdain). Thus, the verse means: 'do not turn your face away from people when you meet them and talk to them for it is a sign of avoidance and arrogance and very much against the norms of gentle manners.'\nIn the next sentence of the verse, it was said: وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ مَرَ‌حًا (and do not walk on the earth haughtily - 18). The last word: مَرَ‌حًا (maraha) denotes walking proudly with assumed airs. The sense of the statement is that Allah Ta’ ala has given this earth the lowest profile from among the entire range of elements He created. Is it not that you were born from it and on it you walk around? Know your reality and do not walk haughtily. This is the way of the arrogant. Therefore, after that, it was said: إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ‌ (Surely, Allah does not like anyone arrogant, proud - 18).",
