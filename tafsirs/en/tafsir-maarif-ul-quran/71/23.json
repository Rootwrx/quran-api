Imam Baghawi reports that these five were in fact righteous servants of Allah who lived in the intervening period between Prophets 'Adam and Nuh (علیہما السلام) . There were many people who held them in high regard and followed their footsteps. Even after their death, they followed their footsteps and complied with Divine injunctions. A while later, Shaitan misled them. He put it to them that if they make pictures of their righteous elders and place them in front, their worship would be perfect and they would attain the quality of humility and humbleness. Those people fell into the Shaitanic trap and carved statues of them and placed them in their temples. When they saw the statues of their elders, their memories were refreshed and experienced a special feeling. That generation gradually died and a new generation came up. Satan played another trick with them. He imparted to them that the object of worship of their elders were statues and idols. They fell for this trick and worshipped them. This is the beginning of idol-worship or idolatry. People of Prophet Nuh (علیہ السلام) gradually got steeped in idolatry. They had many idols, the five mentioned in the verse under comment being the most popular because of the deep love they had for them.\nوَلَا تَزِدِ الظَّالِمِينَ إِلَّا ضَلَالًا (…let not the wrongdoers progress in anything but deviation from the right path\t71:24). This is the supplication of Prophet Nuh (علیہ السلام) against his people. It may not be surmised that the duty and obligation of a Prophetic office is to guide the people, but here Prophet NuhI is praying for increase in his people's misguidance. Prophet Nuh (علیہ السلام) did not invoke this curse out of despair or impatience. In fact, he invoked it when, after doing full justice to his mission for many centuries, his people chose the path of deviation, rebellion, disbelief and obstinacy and persisted in it until they had reached a point of no return, of which Allah informed him thus, 'And it was revealed to Nuh (علیہ السلام) that none of your people would ever believe except those who have already believed__ [ 11:36] '. This situation made it clear to him that his people would definitely and certainly die in the state of disbelief. So he prayed for their final destiny to overtake them sooner and destroy them.",
