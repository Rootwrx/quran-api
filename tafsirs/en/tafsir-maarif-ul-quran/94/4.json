The meaning of raising the name of the Holy Prophet ﷺ is that his blessed name is remembered together with the name of Allah in all the symbols of Islam, like the kalimah, the adhan, the iqamah, and in sermons from the minarets and pulpits [ throughout the world ]:\nاَشھَدُ اَنَّ لا إله إلا اللہ\nاَشھَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدَ رَّسُولُ اَلله\n(I bear witness that there is no God worthy of worship except\nAllah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.'\nNo sensible person utters the Holy Prophet's ﷺ name without respect and honour even though he may not be a Muslim.\nNote Carefully\nHere three verses mention three favours that are bestowed on the Holy Prophet t: [ 1] opening of the bosom widely; [ 2] removal of the burden; and [ 3] raising of the name high. Each of the sentence is composed of a verb, an object and between them is a prepositional phrase thus:\nشرح صدر\nfor your benefit? [ 1] '\nوضع وزر\n'from you your burden [ 2] '\nرفع ذکر\n'for you your name. [ 4] '\nThis indicates the essential characteristic and special greatness of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، in that all this is done for the sake of him.",
