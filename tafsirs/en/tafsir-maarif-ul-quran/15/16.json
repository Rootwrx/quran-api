  "text": "Sequence\nMentioned in the previous verses was the doggedness and hostility of deniers and disbelievers. In the present verse, and in those which follow immediately after, clear proofs of the Oneness, Knowledge and Power of Allah Ta’ ala have been given. Described alongside is what transpires before His creation between the heavens and the earth, a little deliberation in which on the part of a sensible person would make any denial impossible.\nCommentary\nThe word: بُرُ‌وجًا ; is the plural of: بُرُج (burj) which is applied to big palaces and castles and to similar other structural entities. Tafsir authorities Mujahid, Qatadah, Abu Salih and others have explained 'buruj' at this place in the sense of big stars. As for the statement in this verse which points to the creation of these big stars in the sky, the word: السَّمَاءِ (as-sama’) sky means atmosphere which, in common modern day terminology, is called the 'space.' The application of 'as-sama\" in both these senses is common, and recognized. Thus, the physical presence of deep space is identified as 'as-sama\" and the atmosphere much lower than it has also been repeatedly termed as 'as-sama\" in the Holy Qur'an. As for the planets and stars being in the space, and not in the skies, the relevant investigative details, as coordinated with the verses of the Qur’ an and classical and modern astronomy, will Insh’ Allah appear under our comments on the verse: تَبَارَ‌كَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُ‌وجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَ‌اجًا وَقَمَرً‌ا مُّنِيرً‌ا (Blessed is He Who made in the sky stellar formations and made in it the Sun and the Moon providing light) of Surah Al-Furqan (25 :61).",
