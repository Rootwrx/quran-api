  "text": "Commentary\nAccording to Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، when the people of Jannah will enter Jannah, first of all two streams of water will be presented before them. They will drink water from the first stream and all mutual grudges they had from their life in the mortal world - the effect of which naturally survived right through the end - will be totally washed away. In its place, they all will feel love for each other in their hearts because mutual bickering too is virtually a pain and punishment as such, and Jannah is free of all pain.\nAs for the report appearing in Sahih Hadith: 'Anyone who nurses the least grudge in his heart against a Muslim will not go to Jannah,' it means the grudge and malice which is rooted in material ends, and is there by one's personal intention and choice, and because of which this person keeps looking for an opportunity to inflict pain or loss on his enemy. Being ill at ease in someone's company as a matter of natural temperament, a human trait beyond one's control, is not included here. Similar is the case of what is based on some Islamic legal ground. It is this kind of grudge which has been referred to in this verse and where it has been said that such grudge and temperamental distaste will be removed from their hearts.\nIt is about this kind of grudge that Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ said: \"I hope that I shall be, along with Talha and Zubayr, among those the dust of mutual anxiety from whose hearts will be removed while entering Jannah.\" The reference here is to the difference of opinion and resulting conflict which took place between Sayyidna Talha and Sayyidna Zubayr and Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ .",
