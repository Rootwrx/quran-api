They were killed simultaneously and miraculously when signalled by Sayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) .\nThis event provides a guideline in matters of Tabligh and Da'wah. In places and under circumstances where a worker in the way of Allah sees no good coming out of saying what is true and right openly, rather apprehends harm coming to him in doing so, then, under such conditions, doing so secretly is also correct and permissible. However, when there is the option and ability to proclaim things openly, then, no delay should be made in taking a public stance.",
