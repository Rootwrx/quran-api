  "text": "Commentary\nFrom the very beginning of this Surah until now the enmity of the infidels toward Muslims, their rejection of the Oneness of God and prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and putting hurdles in the way of truth and believers were described. In the above verses a way out of this entanglement is suggested in order to come out of the turmoil and spread and propagate the truth, and establish justice - the common name for this action is hijrah (migration).It means to leave the hometown and land where one is forced to speak and act against the truth.\nCommand in connection with hijrah and removal of doubts encountering in its way\nإِنَّ أَرْ‌ضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ (Surely My earth is vast. So, Me alone you worship - 29:56). Allah Ta’ ala has made it clear that His land is very vast and no one should have the excuse that he could not observe the Oneness of Allah, and could not worship Him because in a certain city or country the infidels were in power. It is made clear in these verses that the Muslims should leave the land for the sake of Allah where they are forced to get involved in infidelity and sin, and should try to find out a place for living where they could abide by the commands of Allah Ta’ ala, and persuade others also to follow the same. This is what hijrah is all about.\nDuring the course of migration one is likely to encounter, as a rule, two types of risks, which may hold him back from migration. The first risk is to his life in that the infidels and his adversaries would come in his way, and in order to obstruct his move might take up arms to finish him. In addition, there could be a possibility of his being caught by adversaries on his way out. Hence, there is yet another risk to his life.",
