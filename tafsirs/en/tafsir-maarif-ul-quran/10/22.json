  "text": "Commentary\nThe word: مَک (رح) ر (makr) used in verse 21: قُلِ اللَّـهُ أَسْرَ‌عُ مَكْرً‌ا (Say, \"Allah is more swift in making plans\" ) means secret plan or move that could be good or bad. Wherever this word has become a part of the local language, care should be taken that it is not rendered as ` deception'. For instance, in Urdu, the original language of this Commentary, it means just this. It is obvious that Allah Ta` ala is free from it. (1)\n(1) The English language has no such problems as the open sense of makr can be transmitted through ` plan' or ` move' (Translator)",
