There it was said:\nحَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَدْرَ‌كَهُ الْغَرَ‌قُ قَالَ آمَنتُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا الَّذِي آمَنَتْ بِهِ بَنُو إِسْرَ‌ائِيلَ وَأَنَا مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ\nUntil when he was about to drown, he said, \"I believe that there is no god but the One in Whom the children of Isra'il believe, and I am among those who submit\".",
