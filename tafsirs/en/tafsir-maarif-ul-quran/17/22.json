  "text": "Sequence\nPrevious verses mentioned some conditions attached to the acceptance of deeds. One of the conditions required that no deed is accepted unless it comes with 'Iman (faith, belief) and is in accordance with Shari` ah (Law) and Sunnah (sayings and deeds of the Prophet ï·º). In the present verses, instructions regarding some of such deeds have been given. These are rules set by the Shari'ah of Islam. Their compliance brings success in the Hereafter and their contravention, ruin. And since the most important of these conditions is that of 'Iman, therefore, the very first injunction given here was that of belief in the Oneness of Allah (tauhid). After that come injunctions relating to the rights of the servants of Allah (huquq al-` ibad).",
