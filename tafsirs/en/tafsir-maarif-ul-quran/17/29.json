The purpose is to teach a just and moderate course in spending which does not prevent one from helping others nor does it end up in a lot of trouble for him. There is an event in the background of the revelation of this verse. Ibn Marduwayh has reported it on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Mas’ ud ؓ and al-Baghawi, on the authority of Sayyidna Jabir. According to this report, a boy came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and said, \"My mother asks of you a shirt.\" At that time, the Holy Prophet ﷺ had no shirt except the one that was on his blessed body. He told the boy, \"Come some other time when we have enough means to respond to what your mother is asking for.\" The boy went back home, and returned and said, \"My mother says that you kindly give her the very shirt you have on your blessed body.\" Hearing this, the Holy Prophet ﷺ \ttook the shirt off and let him have it. His body was left bare. Came the time for Salah. Sayyidna Bilal ؓ called the Adhan. But, when he did not come out as usual, people were worried. When some of them went in, they saw that he was sitting bare-bodied without the shirt. Thereupon, this verse was revealed.",
