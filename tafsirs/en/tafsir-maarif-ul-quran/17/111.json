  "text": "And Sayyidna Anas ؓ has said that a child from the tribe of Bani ` Abd al-Muttalib, when able to say meaningful words, was taught to recite this verse by the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then he recited the verse:\nوَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِ‌يكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْ‌هُ تَكْبِيرً‌ا\nAnd say, \"Praise belongs to Allah who has neither taken to Him a son, nor is there any partner to Him in His kingdom, nor is anyone [ needed ] to protect Him because of [ any ] weak-ness. And proclaim His greatness, an open proclamation\" - 111). (Mazhari)\nAnd Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ has said that once he went out with the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، in a manner that his hand was in Holy Prophet ﷺ 's hands. He passed by a person who was disheveled and worried. He asked, 'what brought you to this condition?' That person said, 'sickness and poverty have done this to me.' He said, 'I am going to tell you a few words. If you recite these, your sickness and poverty will go away. The words were:\nوَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّـهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِ‌يكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْ‌هُ تَكْبِيرً‌ا\nI place my trust in the Ever Living who is not to die. Praise be-longs to Allah who has neither taken to Him a son, nor is there any partner to Him in His kingdom, nor is anyone (needed) to protect Him because of (any) weakness. And proclaim His greatness, an open proclamation. (17:111)\nAfter the passage of some time, when he went that way, he found his condition good and showed his pleasure about it. That person told him, 'since the time you taught me these words, I recite them punctually.' (Abu Ya'la and Ibn al-Sunni, as quoted by Mazhari)\nThe Tafslr of Surah Bani Isra’ i1 ends here\nWith the help of Allah\nAfter al-` Isha, Jumada I, 1390 Hijrah\nPraised be Allah, from the beginning to the end.\nA personal postscript by the author\nWhile writing these lines, this humble servant of Allah has completed full seventy five years of his age on 21 Sha` ban, 1390 Hijrah. Year seventy-six opens amidst diseases of different kinds including the natural weakness that sets in at this age. Then there is the mass of things to do and problems to resolve. Who can look forward to the task of writing beyond this point for it would be hoping against hope. But, when it comes to the service of the Qur'an things become different. When some-one does something in the name of the Qur’ an, no matter how insignificant, it becomes for a servant of Allah a matter of good fortune and honour. This thought led me to begin the Tafsir of Surah al-Kahf with the name of Allah. The idea was to take whatever it was possible to do during the years of life left as sufficient and good enough, because the purpose is not to finish the Qur'an, the purpose is to consume one's years and energy into the Qur'an. And Allah is the Over of ability and the helper of the effort made in His way.\n(Abridged from the detailed note)",
