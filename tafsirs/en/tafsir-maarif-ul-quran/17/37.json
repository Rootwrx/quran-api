  "text": "The thirteenth injunction appearing in the second of the two cited verses (37) is: وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ مَرَ‌حًا (And do not walk on the earth haughtily). It means that one should not walk in a way that shows arrogance, pride and exultation, for this is an idiotic act. It is as if one would like to tear the earth apart just by walking on it - something not in his power to accomplish. Or, as if by walking with a challenging gait, he would like to rise much higher - but the mountains of Allah rise far higher than he could ever beat anatomically. In reality, arrogance as such is a major sin that can afflict human heart mortally. Therefore, one must guard against even signs of arrogance exhibited through the way one goes about in life, for they too are impermissible, after all. Walking haughtily, even though one may not be walking by exerting force on the earth, and assuming airs and posing high are impermissible under all conditions. Arrogance is to take yourself superior to others and rate others to be inferior to you. Severe warnings against it appear in Hadith.\nImam Muslim (رح) has reported on the authority of Sayyidna ` Iyad ibn ` Ammar ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Allah Ta` ala has sent this command to me through revelation: Take to humility. Let no man pride on another man, nor adopt an attitude of self-eminence and let no one be unjust to anyone.\" (Mazhari)\nAnd Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Masud ؓ narrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, Not to enter Paradise is he who has arrogance in his heart even to the measure of a particle\" (Mazhari with reference to the Sahih of Muslim).\nAnd it has been reported in Hadith Qudsi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Allah Ta’ ala says that grandeur is My mantle and greatness is My breech. Whoever tries to snatch these from Me, him I shall put in Jahannam (The words rida' and izar signify dress and Allah Ta` ala has no mass or body that would need a dress. Therefore, at this place, it means the attribute of divine glory. So, whoever betrays the wish to become associated with Allah Ta’ ala in this attribute belongs to Hell).\nAnd in another Hadith the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported to have said, \"On the day of Qiyamah, arrogant people will be raised as humans scaled down to the size of tiny ants under the shadow of disgrace descending from all sides. They will be driven to a prison of Hell called Bulas. It will be surrounded with blazing fire, the highest around, and they will be drinking pus and blood excreted by the inmates of Hell to quench their thirst.\" (Tirmidhi on the authority of ` Amr ibn Shu'aib, he from his father, he from his grandfather - Mazhari)\nAnd speaking from the pulpit, Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ said, \"I have heard from the Holy Prophet ﷺ that a person who takes to humility, Allah Ta’ ala elevates him to higher ranks following which he is, though, insignificant in his own sight, but he is great in the sight of everybody else. And whoever waxes proud, him Allah Ta’ ala puts to disgrace following which he is, though, great in his own sight but he is, in the sight of people, worse than a dog and pig.\" (Mazhari)",
