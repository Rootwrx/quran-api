  "text": "The time of the Salah of Tahajjud: Injunctions and rulings\nThe word: فَتَھَجُّد (tahajjud) in: وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ (And during the night, wake up for Salah- 79) has been derived from ھجود :hujud. This word is used for two opposite meanings, that of sleeping and that of waking both. But, the words: وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ at this place, mean be awake with the Qur'an in a part of the night' because the pronoun in: بہٖ (bihi: with it) reverts back to the Qur'an. (Mazhari) 'Being awake with the Qur'an' means the making of Salah (with full compliance of what it requires). This very nightly prayer is called the prayer of Tahajjud in the terminology of Shari'ah. Speaking generally, the sense in which it has been taken is that the prayer said after waking up from a short sleep is the Tahajjud. But, according to Tafsir Mazhari, the sense of the verse is no more than sacrificing sleep to make Salah during some part of the night. This sense holds good for sleeping a little, then waking up from it and making Salah. Very similarly, it is also good if one begins by postponing sleep for Tahajjud and makes the Salah. The condition that one has to sleep before doing the prayer of Tahajjud is not found in the words used by the Qur'an. Apart from this, there are reports from Ahadith which support this general sense of Tahajjud.\nAnd the definition of the prayer of Tahajjud reported from al-Hasan al-Basri (رح) by Imam Ibn Kathir (رح) also confirms this element of generality. The words of the report are as follows:\nقال الحسن البصری (رح) ھو ما کان بعد العشاء و یحمل علٰی ما کان بعد النوم\nAl-Hasan a1-Bari (رح) says: The prayer of Tahajjud holds good for every prayer that is said after al-` Isha And, (because of actual practice) it will be applied to that which is said after some sleep. (Ibn Kathir)\nThe outcome is that being after sleep is no condition in the real sense of the prayer of Tahajjud - and this condition is not present in the words of the Qur'an as well. But, speaking generally, it has been the constant practice of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his noble Companions ؓ that they used to do their Tahajjud prayer after waking up in the later part of the night, therefore, this would be the better way of doing it.\nIs the prayer of Tahajjud Fard (obligatory) or Nafl (additional)?\nThe words: نَفل nafl and نَافِلَةً :nafilah in: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you - 79) literally mean 'additional.' Therefore, prayer (Salah) and charity (sadaqah, khairat) etc. that is not obligatory or necessary and, the doing of which brings thawab (reward), and not doing which entails no sin or misconduct, are called nafl. In this verse, by looking at the words: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you) with the prayer of Tahajjud, it is summarily understood that the prayer of Tahajjud is particularly associated with the Holy Prophet ﷺ as nafl for him. The fact, though, is that its effect as nafl is shared by all, the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his entire ummah. Therefore, some respected early commentators have taken 'nafilah' at this place as an attribute of faridah or duty. The meaning given by them is that the Muslim community at large is obligated with five daily prayers only, but Tahajjud has also been made an additional obligation on the Holy Prophet ﷺ . So, at this place, the word: نَافِلَةً :nafilah appears in the sense of an additional obligation, not in the general sense of nafl.\nLet us look at the correct investigative position in this matter. When, during the early stage of Islam, Surah al-Muzzammil was revealed, that was a time when five prayers had yet to be obligated. What everyone was obligated with was the prayer of Tahajjud. This obligation has been mentioned in Surah al-Muzzammil (73). Then, it was in the night of the Mi` raj (Ascent) that five prayers were made obligatory (fard). So, as for the obligatory nature of Tahajjud, it was abrogated as a duty on the Muslim community at large, by consensus. However, difference did exist about its obligatory nature. Was it also abrogated in the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ? Or, did it remain an obligation on him as a matter of special consideration - and in this verse, the expression: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (nafilatal-lak) means exactly that 'the prayer of Tahajjud is an additional obligation on you.' But, according to Tafsir al-Qurtubi, this is not correct for many reasons. Firstly, there is no justification for taking nafl as fard. If it is supposed to be figurative speech, then, there will be no reality against it. Secondly, in authentic Ahdith, only five fixed prayers have been mentioned as obligatory (fard). At the end of another Hadith, it has been said that the fifty prayers made obligatory initially in the nocturnal journey of the Mi` raj were later reduced in number and set at five. Thus, the number was, though, reduced but the reward promised against these was that of no less than fifty. Then it was said: مَا يُبَدَّلُ الْقَوْلُ لَدَيَّ (The word [ given to My servants ] will not be changed with Me - Qaf, 50:29). It means: When the command was given for fifty, the reward shall be given for no less than fifty, though the number to be actually performed was re-duced.\nThe outcome of these narrative reports is no other but that no Salah - other than the five prayers - is obligatory (fard) on the Muslim ummah at large and on the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself. Then, there is a reason for it too. Had the word: نَافِلَةً nafilah been used here in the sense of an 'additional duty,' then, rather than using the word: لکَ (lak: for you) after it, the word used should have been: علَیک ('alaik: on you) since the latter signifies obligation while the word: لَکَ (lak: for you) is used only for approval and permission.\nSimilarly, this is the position declared to be correct and sound in Tafsir Mazhari which says: When the obligatory status of Tahajjud was abrogated in the case of the Muslim ummah, it stood abrogated in the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as well.\t What remained was nafl for everyone. But, this position raises a question: What is the singularity of the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tin it? That it is nafl for everyone already stands proved. What, then, would be the outcome of saying: نَافِلَةً لَّكَ (an additional prayer for you)? The answer is that, according to clear statements of Ahadith, all kinds of voluntary offerings and nafl ` Ibadat made by the Muslim ummah expiate their sins and serve as complements to whatever shortcomings remain in the performance of their obligatory prayers. But, the Holy Prophet ﷺ is not only that he is infallible (ma` sum) against sins, he is also above from any shortcomings in the observance of the etiquette of Salah. Therefore, as far as he is concerned, nafl ` Ibadat are nothing but additional. These cannot make amends for any shortcomings. Instead, these are simply a source of increased nearness to Allah. (Qurtubi, Mazhari)\nIs the prayer of Tahajjud Nafl or Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah?\nAs for Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah (the emphasized Sunnah), Muslim jurists have a standing rule. Whatever the Holy Prophet ﷺ has done constantly, never leaving it unless under compulsion, is Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah - except that it is proved on the authority of an Islamic legal argument that the particular act was special to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and was not for the Muslim community in general. This rule will obviously re-quire that the prayer of Tahajjud should also be taken as Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah for everyone and not a mere nafl. The reason is that the constancy of the Holy Prophet ﷺ in the matter of this Salah stands proved as an uninterrupted Sunnah. And there is no proof of its being restricted to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Therefore, it should be Sunnah al-Mu` ak-kadah for the Muslim ummah at large as well. This is the position Tafsir Mazhari rates as preferable, weightier and worthier. In proof of this being 'emphasized' (al-mu'akkadah), it has pointed out to the Hadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said about a person who used to say his Tahajjud prayer earlier but left it later: 'the Shaitan has soiled his ear.' Such a drastic admonition and warning does not sound in order against the abandonment of nafl only. This tells us that it is Sunnah al-Mu'akkadah (an emphasized Sunnah).\nAnd as for the respected elders who take the position that Tahajjud is only a nafl, they declared this perseverance and constancy to be the hallmark of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Then, what he said as admonition against the abandonment of Tahajjud by the person who used to do it before was not really said against its abandonment by him as such. Instead, it was said against first getting used to it, then abandoning it. The reason is that a person who gets into the habit of doing a certain nafl must continue with it assiduously - and there is a consensus of the Muslim ummah on it. If one leaves it after being in the habit of doing it, he will be blameworthy because leaving it without excuse after the habit is the sign of certain evasion and reluctance. However, there is no blame on the person who is just not in the habit of doing it from the very beginning. Allah knows best.\nThe number of Raka` at in the prayer of Tahajjud\nIn the Sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as narrated by Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ ، 'the Holy Prophet ﷺ would never say more than eleven raka’ at, in Ramadan or during months other than it.' Out of these eleven, according to the Hanafiyyah, three raka’ at used to be that of witr, the remaining eight being that of Tahajjud.\nAnd in a narration of Sahih Muslim, the following words of Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ have been reported: 'The Holy Prophet ﷺ used to say thirteen raka’ at during the night which includes witr and two raka’ at of the Sunnah of Fajr as well.' (Mazhari) The Sunnah of Fajr has been counted with the nightly prayer because they are performed in almost the same sequence. These reports tell us that the usual habit of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was to offer eight raka’ at in the prayer of Tahajjud.\nBut, from a report coming from Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ herself, it also stands proved that, on occasions, he has done less than that number - four or six - as being sufficient. When Sayyidna Masruq asked her about the prayer of Tahajjud, she has been reported in the Sahih of al-Bukhari to have said: 'There used to be seven, nine and eleven raka’ at - other than the Sunnah of Fajr' (Mazhari from al- Bukhari). According to the Hanafiyyah, if three rakaat are that of witr, four out of seven, six out of nine and eight out of eleven turn out to be the rak’ at of Tahajjud.\nIn what manner was the prayer of Tahajjud offered?\nNarrative reports as they generally appear in Ahadith prove that the first two rak’ at in the beginning were light with a brief recitation. Then, in the rest of the rak’ at, the recitation was long and so were the ruku' and sajdah - and, at times, this length would become too much and, at others, somewhat less. (This is a summary of the Hadith reports taken from Tafsir Mazhari at this place)\nThe Praised Station\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ has been promised مقام محمود (Maqam Mahmud: The Praised Station) in this verse and this station is, out of all prophets, particular to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . As to its explanation, there are different sayings. But, the most sound of them is what appears in authentic Ahadith in the words of the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself. This Station is the station of the Grand Intercession (al-shaf'ah al-kubra). This will come to pass on the plains of Resurrection (al-Hashr) when all children of 'Adam will be there requesting every prophet and Messenger of Allah ﷺ to intercede with Him on their behalf. All prophets (علیہم السلام) will offer their excuse. Only the Holy Prophet ﷺ shall be blessed with the honorable station of interceding on behalf of the entire progeny of 'Adam. Hadith reports carry lengthy relevant details that appear in Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Mazhari at this point.\nThe intercession made by prophets and the righteous will be accepted\nOut of the Islamic sects, the Khawarij and the Mu'tazilah deny the intercession of prophets. They say that a major sin will not be forgiven through intercession by anyone. But, Ahadith coming in uninterrupted succession prove that the intercession for sinners will be accepted from Prophets (علیہم السلام) ، even from the righteous of the community. There will be many whose sins will be forgiven through intercession.\nBased on a report from Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ ، it appears in Ibn Majah and al-Baihaqi that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: On the day of Qiyamah, the blessed prophets will be the first to intercede on behalf of sinners, then the ` Ulama' and then the Shuhada'. According to Dailami reporting from Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that the ` Alim will be told that he could intercede on behalf of his disciples, even if their number matches the number of stars.\nAnd Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban carry a narration of Sayyidna Abu al-Darda' ؓ ، with its chains ascending to the Holy Prophet ﷺ who said: The intercession made by a Shahid (شَھِید) will be accepted in favour of seventy people from his family.\nThe Musnad of Ahmad, al-Tabarani and al-Baihaqi authentically report Sayyidna Abu Umamah ؓ narrating that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: On the intercession of one person from my ummah many people, more than the entire number of the people of the tribes of Rabi'ah and Mudar, will be admitted to Jannah.\nA question and its answer\nThe question is when the Holy Prophet ﷺ will himself intercede - and no believer will remain in Hell because of it - why and how will the ` Ulama' and the righteous intercede? The answer appears in Tafsir Mazhari: perhaps, the ` Ulama' and the righteous of the community will present their intercession in favour of whomsoever they wish before the Holy Prophet ﷺ who will then intercede with Allah Ta` ala.\nAn important note\nIn a Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: شَفَاعَتِی لِاَھلِ الکَبایٔرِ من اُمَّتِی (My intercession shall be for people who had committed major sins). This seems to tell us that those involved with major sins will be forgiven particularly through the intercession of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Any angel or any individual from the Muslim community will not be able to intercede in the case of those who have committed major sins. Instead of that, the intercession made by the righteous of the Muslim community will be for those who were involved with minor sins.\nThe Station of Intercession could be reached through the efficacy of the prayer of Tahajjud\nHadrat Mujaddid Alf Thani, the famous religious revivalist of the first Islamic millennium in India, said that, in this verse, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was first given the command to make the prayer of Tahajjud, then he was promised the Praised Station, that is, the Station of Grand Intercession. This tells us that the prayer of Tahajjud serves as a special via media in acquiring the Station of Intercession.\nBefore we proceed to verse 8o, let us recapitulate what was said in the verses previous to it. Mentioned there first were the pains inflicted on the Holy Prophet ﷺ and the conspiracies they kept hatching to hurt and harm him. Along with it, it was also said that these hostile plans made by them will never succeed. In contrast, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was being blessed with the real plan to offset their evil by prompting him to establish the five prayers, and the Tahajjud. Following that, he has been promised the Praised Station, the highest among all prophets - a promise to be fulfilled in the Hereafter. Now, in this verse 80: وَقُل رَّ‌بِّ أَدْخِلْنِي (And say, \"0 my Lord, make me enter...), the first relief to him against the hurtful and treacherous actions of the disbelievers was given by Allah Ta` ala within this world in the form of his migration to Madinah. Then, he was given the good news of the conquest of Makkah in: وَقُلْ جَاءَ الْحَقُّ (And say, \"Truth has come...81).",
