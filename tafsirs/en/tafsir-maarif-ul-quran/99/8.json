By 'evil' here is meant the evil for which the evil-doer has not repented. The Qur'an and the Sunnah bear ample testimony to the fact that any sinner who sincerely repents for his sins Allah will most certainly accept his repentance. However, the sins for which the sinners have not repented in this world shall certainly bring their results, no matter how trivial or petty they might have been in their appearance. That is why the Messenger of Allah ﷺ warned Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ to beware of the sins that are belittled, for indeed they will be taken account of by Allah.\" [ Transmitted by Nasa'i and Ibn Majah ].\nSayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ says that this verse is most robust and comprehensive verse of the Holy Qur'an. Sayyidna Anas ؓ in a lengthy narration reports that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ referred to this verse as الفاذۃ الجامعہ \"the unique, most comprehensive verse\".\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Az-Zilzal\nEnds here",
