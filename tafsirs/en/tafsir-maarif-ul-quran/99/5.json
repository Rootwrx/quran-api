Muslim has recorded in his Sahih from Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n\"The earth will throw out the pieces of its liver [ contents ]. Gold and silver will come out like columns. A murderer will come and say: 'I killed for this?' The one who broke the ties of kinship will say: 'For this I severed the ties of kinship?' The thief will say: 'For this I got my hand amputated?' Then they will leave it there, and no one will take anything from it.\"",
