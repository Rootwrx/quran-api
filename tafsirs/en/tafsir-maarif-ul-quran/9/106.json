We already know that seven of the ten believers, who had missed the battle of Tabuk without a valid excuse, had demonstrated their heartfelt remorse by tying themselves up to the pillars of the Prophet's Mosque. The injunction which covers them appeared in the first verse (102): آخَرُ‌ونَ اعْتَرَ‌فُوا (And there are others who admitted their sins). Verse 106 is now referring to the other three gentlemen who had not done what the group of seven had done in the Masjid. Thus, they had not admitted their misconduct openly. In their case, the Holy Prophet ﷺ ordered his Companions ؓ to see that Muslims boycott them by not talking to them. When things reached those limits, they learnt their lesson, confessed to their misconduct and repented sincerely, following which orders were given for their pardon. (Sahib a1-Bukhari and Muslim)",
