  "text": "Commentary\nMentioned in several previous verses there are hypocrites whose hypocrisy stood exposed through their words and deeds, and the Holy Prophet ﷺ did realize that they were hypocrites. Mentioned in the present verse appearing above there are hypocrites whose hy-pocrisy was so perfect in its camouflage that it remained hidden from the Holy Prophet ﷺ until then. In this verse, two Divine punishments to come much before 'Akhirah upon such diehard hypocrites have been mentioned. In the first instance, right here in this world, they are consumed by the concern to hide their hypocrisy and the fear that it may be exposed. Then, no less a punishment is their being under compulsion to respect and follow Islam and Muslims, at least outwardly, despite their extreme malice and hostility for them. And then, there is the other punishment, the punishment of the grave and the punishment of Barzakh (the post-death - pre-resurrection state) that will reach them well before Qiyamah (doomsday) and 'Akhirah (Hereafter).",
