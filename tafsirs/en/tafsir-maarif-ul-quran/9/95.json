  "text": "2.\tThe second instruction to the Holy Prophet ﷺ appears in the second verse (95) where it has been said that these people will come to him after his return to Madinah, impress him with their feigned oaths and try to satisfy him. What they would wish to achieve from this initiative is: لِتُعْرِ‌ضُوا عَنْهُمْ (so that you may ignore their misdeed), that is, ignore their absence from Jihad and spare the reproach due on it.' Thereupon, it was said that he might as well grant their wish. The text says: فَأَعْرِ‌ضُوا عَنْهُمْ :` you ignore them.' Thus, the instruction carries the sense: ` neither reproach and admonish, nor deal with pleasantly' - because, reproach usually brings no good. When they have no faith in their heart - and they do not want to have it either - what would come out of reproach? So, why waste good time!",
