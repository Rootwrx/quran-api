  "text": "Announced in verse 64: إِنَّ اللَّـهَ مُخْرِ‌جٌ مَّا تَحْذَرُ‌ونَ (Allah is surely to bring out what you are afraid of) is the news that Allah will expose their conspiracy and mischief. One such event came to pass while returning from the battle of Tabuk when some hypocrites had conspired to kill the Messenger of Allah. Allah Almighty informed him about the plan through angel Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) helping him to bypass the spot where the hypocrites were sitting in ambush. (Mazhari with reference to al-Baghawi)\nAnd Sayyidna ` Ibn ` Abbas ؓ says that Allah Ta` ala had in-formed the Holy Prophet al about the names of seventy hypocrites complete with their parentage and addresses. But, being the universal mercy, he did not disclose these before his people. (Mazhari)",
