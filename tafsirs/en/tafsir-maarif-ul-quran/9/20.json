  "text": "Verse 20 enlarges upon the subject initiated with the words: لَا يَسْتَوُونَ (la yastawun: they are not equal) in the previous verse (19) where it was said that the believing Mujahidin and those engaged only in maintaining the masjid and serving water to pilgrims are not equal. This was enlarged by saying: الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَهَاجَرُ‌وا وَجَاهَدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّـهِ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ أَعْظَمُ دَرَ‌جَةً عِندَ اللَّـهِ ۚ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ ﴿20﴾ (those who believed and emigrated and took up jihad in the way of Allah, with their wealth and lives, are greater in rank in the sight of Allah, and they are the successful ones). The reason is that the Mushriks against them simply had no measure of success whatsoever. As for Muslims in general, they too shared this success in essence, but the success of those identified above had more to it. There-fore, they were the ones whose success was comprehensive.",
