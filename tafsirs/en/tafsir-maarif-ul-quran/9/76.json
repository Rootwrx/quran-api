  "text": "The second verse: وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ عَاهَدَ اللَّـهَ\t(And among them there are those who made a pledge with Allah - 75) is also connected with a particular event which has been reported by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwayh, Al-Tabarani and Al-Baihaqi on the authority of a narration from Sayyidna Abu Umamah Bahili ؓ . According to this report, a person called Tha'labah ibn Hatib al-Ansari presented himself before the Holy Prophet ﷺ and requested him to pray that he becomes rich. He said, ` Is it that you do not like my way? By the Being that holds my life in his His hands, if I had wished, mountains of Madinah would have turned into solid gold following behind me on my walkways. But, I do not like being that wealthy.' The man went away. But, he returned later and repeated his request for the same prayer with the pledge that, should he get the wealth prayed for, he would give every deserving person his share from it. The Holy Prophet ﷺ made the prayer. The effect of the prayer showed up in an unprecedented increase in the number of goats he owned. When the number increased further, the space in Madinah became too small for him. So, he moved out into the outskirts from where he used to come to Madinah where he offered the Sa1ah of Zuhr and ` Asr with the Holy Prophet ﷺ As for the rest of the prayers, he used to perform these in the wilderness where his herd of goats, his prized possession, was located.\nThen, this very flock of goats became so large that even that area on the outskirts became insufficient. He moved farther away from Madinah coming there only on Fridays for the Jumu'ah Sa1ah. As for the five daily prayers, he did them where he was stationed. Then came further increases in his wealth and he had to leave that spot too, only to go far away from Madinah where he sat deprived of his Jumu'ah and Jama'ah both.\nAfter the passage of some time, the Holy Prophet ﷺ asked people about him. They told him that his ` wealth' had increased to such proportions that he had to go far away from Madinah and that is why he is not seen in the city. On hearing this, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: ویحَ ثَعلَبَۃ (Alas for Thalabah) three times.\nBy chance, it was the time when came the revelation of the verse of Sadaqat (60) where the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been commanded to collect Sadaqat from Muslims - (خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صدقَۃً ). He had the whole law of Sadaqat committed to writing, appointed two persons as the collectors of Sadaqah and sent them to collect the Sadaqat due on livestock owned by Muslims. They were ordered to go to Tha'labah ibn Hatib as well, and to another person from the tribe of Bani Sulaym also.\nWhen the two collectors reached Tha'labah and presented the order of the Holy Prophet ﷺ he said that this thing had be-come a sort of Jizyah which is taken from non-Muslims. Then he hedged and asked them to leave on that occasion, however, they could call on him on their way back. The two of them left.\nSomething different happened in the case of the other person from the tribe of Bahl Sulaym. When he heard about the order of the Holy Prophet ﷺ he himself called on the two emissaries of his master carrying with him the best from out of his livestock of camels and goats, precisely according to his Zakatable nisab of Sadaqah. They told him that they have orders not to pick out the best among animals, in fact, they were supposed to take the average ones, therefore, they could not take these. The man from Bahl Sulaym insisted that it was his pleasure to present those very animals and requested that they be accepted as they were.\nAfter that, when these two emissaries had completed their circuit of Sadaqah collection, they returned to Tha'labah. He told them that he wanted to see that Law of Sadaqah they were talking about. He looked at it and said no more than what he had said earlier - ` this thing has become a sort of Jizyah that should not be taken from Muslims.' ` All right,' he said, ` you can go for now. I have to think about it first. I will decide later.'\nWhen these two gentlemen reached Madinah, they went to see the Holy Prophet ﷺ . At that time he, before hearing their report on the mission, repeated the words he had said earlier: یَا وَیحَ ثَعلَبَۃ یَا وَیحَ ثَعلَبَۃ یَا وَیحَ ثَعلَبَۃ (Alas for Tha'labah). He said it three times. After that, he was pleased to hear about the Sulaymi deal and prayed for him. Thereupon, came the verse: وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ عَاهَدَ اللَّـهَ (And among them there are those who made a pledge with Allah - 75). It means: ` if Allah gave them wealth, they would give out alms and charities and fulfill the rights of all de-serving people, the relatives and the poor, as done by the righteous people of the community. But, when Allah blessed them with wealth, out of His grace, they became misers overnight and turned away from their pledge of obedience to Allah and His Messenger.'",
