  "text": "Special Merit of Surah At-Takathur\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ is reported to have once asked the noble Companions: Is there anyone from amongst you who has the strength to recite one thousand verses a day?\" The blessed Companions replied: \"Who can recite a thousand verses a day?\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"Can you not recite Surah At-Takathur?\" This implies that Surah At-Takathur equals in weight and worth to a thousand verses, thus stressing its great importance. [ Mazhari with reference to Hakim and Baihagi on the authority of Ibn Umar ].\nWarning Against Materialistic Attitude\nVerse [ 1] أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ‌ (You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing [ worldly benefits ].) The word takathur is derived from the root kathrah, and means 'to amass much wealth'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Hasan Basri (رح) have assigned this interpretation to it. Qatadah\tرحمۃ اللہ علیہ says that this word is also used in the sense of 'taking pride in the abundance of material goods'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ reports that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this verse and explained its meaning, thus: \"Acquiring wealth but not paying out of it the obligatory dues.\" [ Qurtubi ].",
