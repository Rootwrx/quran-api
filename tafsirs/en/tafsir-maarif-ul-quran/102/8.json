  "text": "Verse [ 102:8] ثُمَّ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ النَّعِيمِ (Then you will be asked about all the pleasures [ you enjoyed in the world ].) This means that, on the Day of Judgment, all of you will be questioned whether you had shown gratitude towards Allah's favors, or did you misuse them and were ungrateful to Allah? Some of these favors and bounties are explicitly mentioned elsewhere in the Qur'an:\nإِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ‌ وَالْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولَـٰئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْئُولًا\n(...Surely, the ear, the eye and the heart - each one of them shall be interrogated about.) [ 17:36]\nThese organs and their faculties comprehend millions of blessings of Allah, and man will be questioned as to how he used them every moment of his life.\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ is reported to have said that first question that will be put by Allah to every person is: \"Did I not give you good health, and did I not give you cold water to quench your thirst?\" (Tirmidhi, and Ibn Hibban, with rating as sahib, from Abu Hurairah, as quoted by Ibn Kathir)\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ is also reported to have said that no man will be able to move from his place unless he answers five questions: [ 1] How did he spend his life? [ 2] In what pursuits did he expend his youthful energy? [ 3] How did he earn his wealth - (by lawful means or unlawful means?) [ 4] Where did he spend his wealth - (in lawful ways or unlawful ways?) and [ 5] Did he act upon the knowledge Allah gave him? (Bukhari).\nMujahid (رح) ، the leading authority on Tafsir, says that this question on the Day of Judgment relates to every delight of the world that he enjoyed - whether it is in connection with food, clothes, house, wife, children, kingdom, government or honor. Qurtubi, having cited this, concludes that this is absolutely true, because the question does not specify any particular blessing.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah At-Takathur\nEnds here",
