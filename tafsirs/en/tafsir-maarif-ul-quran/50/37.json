  "text": "Channels of Acquiring Knowledge\nلِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ ( who has a heart - 50:37). Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that here the word qalb [ heart ] means ` aql [ intellect ], because the centre of intellect is heart. Some scholars of Qur'an say that \"heart\" here refers to life, because the axis of life is heart. Thus the verse means only that person will be able to benefit from the advice and lesson of the Qur'an who has life or a sound understanding with which he comprehends. The one devoid of intellect cannot benefit from the Qur'an.\nأَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ (and gives ear [ to the truth ] attentively....50:37). The phrase Ilqa'-us- sam' connotes to listen to someone attentively and the word Shahid means present. The message of the above verses is that two types of people benefit: [ 1] a person who has the mind and the intellect who understands it in his mind and accepts it; and [ 2] a person who gives his ears and listens to the Divine verses with an attentive heart, while his heart is present and not absent. Mazhari interprets that the first type is called kamilin [ thoroughly proficient members of the Islamic community ]. The second type is their followers and sincere seekers of Reality who are under the direction of a spiritual guide who, on account of their sincerity and purity of heart, accept the teachings of the religion.",
