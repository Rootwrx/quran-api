The Prophetic Tradition indicates that this 'hurrying up' will be towards Syria where the Dome of the Rock is situated. Israfil (علیہ السلام) will stand on it, and call the people on the Day of Judgment. It is recorded in Jami` Tirmidhi, on the authority of Sayyidna Mu` awiyah Ibn Hayadah ؓ ، that the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، pointing towards Syria, said:\nمِن ھٰھُنَا اِلیٰ ھٰھُنَا تُحشَرُونَ رُکبَاناً وَّ مُشَاۃً وَّ تُجَرُّونَ علیٰ وُجُھِکُم یَومَ القِیامَۃ\n\"From here towards that [ pointing towards Syria ] you will be raised, some riding, and others on foot, and yet others will be dragged on the faces on the Day of Judgment...\"",
