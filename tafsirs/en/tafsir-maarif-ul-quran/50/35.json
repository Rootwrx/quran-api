  "text": "Verse [ 35] depicts the delights of Paradise: The first part states لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا (For them there will be whatever they wish,,,,, 50:35]. In other words, the righteous will have whatever delights they wish brought forthwith without any delay. It is recorded in Musnad of Ahmad on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Said Khudri ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"If anyone in Paradise wishes for children, the conception, delivery of the baby and its growth will all take place in a short span of time.\" (Ibn Kathir)\nThe second part of the verse states: وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ (and with Us there is even more.) In other words, there are with Allah such desirable delights which have not been conceived of by any man and, therefore, they could not wish or desire for them. Sayyidna Anas and Jabir ؓ said that \"more\" in this context refers to the greatest reward of enabling the people of Jannah to see Allah bila kaif [ without \"how\" or in an indescribable manner ]. This, according to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، is similar to His other statement in [ 10:26] لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ \"For those who have done good is the best and even more.\" Some reports narrate that the inmates of Paradise will see Allah on Friday [ Qurtubi ]",
