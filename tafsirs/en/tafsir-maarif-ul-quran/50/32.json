That is to say, Paradise has been promised to every person who is awwab and hafiz. Awwab refers to the person who turns to Allah. Here it means who turns to Him in repentance against sins. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud, Sha` bi and Mujahid ؓ said that Awwab refers to a person who recalls his sins in loneliness, private and secret, and seeks Allah's forgiveness. ` Ubaid Ibn ` Umair ؓ said that Awwab is one who seeks Allah's forgiveness of his sins in every sitting. And he further said that we are advised to recite the following invocation:\nسُبحانَ اللہِ وَ بِحَمدِہٖ اللَّھُمَّ اِنِّی اَستغفِرُکَ مِمَّآ اَصَبتُ فِی مَجلِسِی ھٰذا\n\"Pure is Allah and praise be to Him. 0 Allah, I seek Your forgiveness of the evil that I might have committed in this sitting.\"\nIn a Prophetic Tradition, we are advised to recite the following supplication when dispersing. Allah will forgive all the sins that might have been committed in that session:\nسُبحَانَکَ اللَّھُمَّ وَ بِحَمدِکَ لَٓا اِلٰہَ اِلَّا اَنتَ اَستغفِرُکَ وَ اَتُوبُ اِلَیکَ\n\"Pure are You, 0 Allah, and praise be to You. There is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn to You in penitence.\"\nHafiz (حَفِيظٍ ), according to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، is one who remembers his sins, so that he may return to Allah in penitence and make amends. Another report from him defines اَلحَفِظُ ھُوِ الحَافِظُ لِاَمرِ اللہِ haflz as one who remembers his covenant with Allah, and does not break or betray it. Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ reports from the Holy Prophet ﷺ who said: \"Whoever performs four rak` at of Ishraq prayer early in the day is Awwab and Hafiz (Qurtubi).",
