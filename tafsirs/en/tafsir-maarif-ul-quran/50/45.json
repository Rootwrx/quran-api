This means that the message of the Qur'an is to be conveyed to the entire mankind, to all and sundry. However, only those who fear Allah and dread His torment will remember and heed. Qatadah used to recite this verse and supplicate in the following words:\nاَللّٰھُمَّ اجعَلنَا مِمَّن یَّخَافُ وَعِیدَکَ وَ یَرجُوا مَوعوُدَکَ یَا بَارُّ یَا رَحِیمُ\n\"0 Allah! Make us among those who fear Your threat, and hope for Your promise, 0 the One who fulfills His promise, 0 Rahim [ the Most Merciful ].\"\nAlhamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Qaf\nEnds here",
