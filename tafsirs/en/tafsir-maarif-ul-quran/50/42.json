  "text": "يَوْمَ يُنَادِ الْمُنَادِ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِ‌يبٍ (...the Day when the caller will call from a near place - 50:41). Sayyidna Ibn ` Asakir ؓ reports from Zaid Ibn Jabir Shafi` i that the \"caller\" referred to here is the angel Israfil (علیہ السلام) who will stand on the Dome of the Rock (Sakhrah) and will address all the dead people of the entire world : \"0 you rotten bones! 0 you decomposed skins! 0 you scattered hair! Listen, Allah commands you to reassemble to render account of your actions (Mazhari).\" This scene depicts how, after the second blowing of the trumpet, the world will be resurrected. The phrase \"a near place\" refers to the fact that the voice of the angel will reach everybody who rises from death anywhere on the surface of the earth, and will feel as though the angel had called him from a nearby place. 'Ikrimah ؓ says that the voice will be heard in such a way as if someone is speaking to us in our ears. Other scholars have said that \"a near place\" refers to the Dome of the Rock, because that is the centre of the earth, and is equidistant, being separated by equal distances from all sides of the globe.
