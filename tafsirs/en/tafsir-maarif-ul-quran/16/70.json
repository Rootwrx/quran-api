  "text": "Commentary\nMentioned previously were various states of water, vegetation, cattle and honey bee through which Allah Ta’ ala had reminded human beings of His perfect power of creation and of His blessings for the created. Now, through the words of the present verse, they have been invited to ponder over the very state they are in. Human beings were nothing. Allah Ta’ ala blessed them with existence. Then, by sending death when He willed, He terminated that blessing. As for some others, they are, much before their death, carried to such a stage of extreme old age that their senses do not work, they lose the strength of their hands and feet. They understand nothing, nor can they remember what they do. This change in their world-view and self-view proves that knowledge and power reside in the exclusive domain of the One who is the Creator and Master.\nThe expression مِنكُم مَّن يُرَ‌دُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ (and there are some among you who are carried back to-the worst part of the age) gives a hint that man has seen a time of weakness earlier too. This was the early stage of child-hood marked by its lack of understanding and physical strength, and dependence on others in eating, drinking, getting up and sitting down. Then came youth, the time to prosper and move ahead. Then, gradually, man is carried to a stage of the same age of helplessness as it was in early childhood.\nThe expression أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ (translated as 'the worst part of the age' ) means the extreme old age when all physical and mental faculties become weak and confused. The Holy Prophet ﷺ always prayed: اللھُمَّ اِنِّی اَعُوذُبِکَ مَن سُوءِ العُمَرِ مِن اَن اُرَدَّ اَلٰی اَرذَلِ العُمرِ\n'0 Allah, I seek refuge with You from the evil of age'\nand according to another narration:\nاللَّھُمَّ اِنِّی اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِن اَن اَرُدَّ اِلٰی اَرذَلِ العُمِرُ\n'0 Allah, I seek refuge with you from that I be carried to the worst part of the age.'\nThe definition of: أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ (the worst part of the age) remains undetermined. However, the definition appearing above seems to be weightier, something to which the Qur’ an too has alluded by saying: لِكَيْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا (that he knows nothing after having knowledge) that is, the age in which he is in, senses do not remain active as a result of which a person forgets everything he knows.\nThis 'worst part of the age' أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ has been defined variously. Some say it is the age of eighty years while some others say it is ninety. Also reported from Sayyidna Ali ؓ ، there is a statement which puts it at seventy five. (Sahilhayn as quoted by Mazhari)\nAfter that appears the tersely-phrased sentence also mentioned above: (that he knows nothing after having knowledge). This is about the phenomena of old age (which, in our time, has given birth to the study of gerontology). When one is made to reach its extreme stage, one is left with no functional strength, neither physical nor rational. What he knows now, he may not know moments later. All information he has, he may forget and become like a child born yesterday who has no knowledge or awareness or understanding or intelligence. Hadrat ` Ikrimah ؓ says: 'This state will not prevail upon the reciter of the Qur’ an.'\nIn the last sentence of the verse, it was said: إِنَّ اللَّـهَ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ‌ (Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful). It means that from knowledge He knows everyone's age, and from power He does what He wills. If He wills, He can have a strong young man be overtaken by the signs of the worst part of old age, and should He so will, even a hundred-year old aged man could remain a strong youngman. All this lies within the power of that sole Being in whose divinity there is no partner or associate.",
