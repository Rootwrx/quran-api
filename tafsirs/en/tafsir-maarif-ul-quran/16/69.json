  "text": "The second instruction appears in: ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَ‌اتِ (Then, eat from all the fruits) where the bee is being commanded to suck juices from fruits and flowers as it desires and likes. No doubt, what is said here is: مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَ‌اتِ (from all the fruits). But, obviously, the word: کُلّ (kull) used here does not mean the fruits and flowers of the whole world. Instead of that, it means those within easy reach, and which serve the desired purpose. This word: کُلّ (kull) has also appeared in relation to the event concerning the queen of Saba' where it was said:\tوَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ (she has got everything - An-Naml, 27:23). It is obvious that 'all' or 'every' in this sense do not denote totality without exception to the limit that the queen of Saba' be required to have a personal aeroplane, Rolls Royce and palace train! What is meant here is what she needed to have as complement to her function as the ruler of the time. So, here too, the expression: مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَ‌اتِ (from all the fruits) means nothing but this. As for the bee sucking juices from fruits and flowers, it can be said that the molecular composition of juices she sucks is extremely refined and precious, the extraction of which in identical measure through mechanical means even in our advanced scientific age cannot be accomplished as efficiently.\nThen comes the third instruction: فَاسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَ‌بِّكِ ذُلُلًا (and go along the pathways of your Lord made easy for you). When the bee goes to suck juices from fruits and flowers to places far away from home, then, obviously enough, its return to home base should have been difficult. But, Allah Ta’ ala has made flight routes easy for it. Thus, it goes miles away and returns home without straying or getting lost. Allah Ta’ ala has made for it flying routes in the air because in going by the circuitous pathways on land, there is the likelihood of going astray. So, it can be said that Allah Ta’ ala has subjugated the air space for this humble bee so that it can go home without any let or hindrance.\nAfter that, the real outcome of this revealed command was stated in the following words: يَخْرُ‌جُ مِن بُطُونِهَا شَرَ‌ابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ (From their bellies comes out a drink of various colours in which there is cure for people - 69). The difference in colour is caused by the difference of climate and by what they suck from. This is the reason why a particular area with abundance of particular kinds of fruits and flowers does leave its effect and taste on the honey produced in that area. Since honey comes in the form of a liquid substance, therefore, it was called 'sharab' (drink). Even in this sentence, present there is a decisive proof of the Oneness and Power of Allah Ta’ ala. Is it not that this tasty and blissful drink comes out from the belly of a tiny animal which, in itself, is armed with poison? The emergence of antidote from poison is really a unique exhibit of the most perfect power of Allah Ta’ ala. Then, such is the staggering working of nature that milk from milch animals does not turn red or yellow under the effect of different climates and foods while honey from the bee does take different colours.\nAs for the oft-quoted statement: فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ (in which there is cure for people), it can be said that honey is, on the one hand, an energy-giving food as well as a delicacy in terms of taste and flavor, while on the other hand, it serves as a remedial prescription for diseases too. And why not? This delicate mobile machine which goes about extracting pure and pow-erful essences from all kinds of fruits and flowers after which it returns home to store them in its safe compartments specially designed, constructed and guarded for a purpose. Now, if natural herbs and plants contain ingredients which have medicinal and curative properties, why would everything disappear from their essences? Honey is used as medicine directly in phlegmatic diseases while in other diseases it is recommended in combination with other ingredients. Expert physicians in the Greco-Arab medical tradition include it specially as a binder in their medicinal electuaries. Another property of honey is that it does not get spoiled itself and, on top of it, it helps preserve other things as well for a long time. This is the reason why eastern physicians have been using it as an alternate of alcohol for thousands of years. Honey is laxative and proves efficient in expelling unhealthy substances from the stomach.\nA Sahabi mentioned the sickness of his brother before the Holy Prophet ﷺ . He advised him to give his brother a drink of honey. He returned the next day and reported that his brother was still sick. He repeated his advice. On the third day, when he again said that there was no change in his condition, he said: صَدَقَ اللہُ وَ کَذ۔ بَ بَطنُ اَخیِکَ (The word of Allah is true. The stomach of your brother is a liar). The sense was that there is nothing wrong with the suggested remedy. It was the particular temperamental condition which had caused delay in the actual effect of the remedy. When the treatment with honey was repeated after that, the patient got well.\nAt this place in the Holy Qur’ an, the word: شِفَاءً (shifa': remedy, cure, bliss) appears as common noun (nakirah) in the context of an affirmative sentence. That it is shifa' for every disease is not apparent on this basis.\nBut, the nunnation (tanwin) of 'shifa\" which carries the sense of greatness does necessarily prove that the shita' in honey is of a great and distinct nature. Then there are those spiritually valiant servants of Allah who just have no doubt about honey being a cure for any disease whatsoever. So firmly convinced they are with their staunch belief in the very outward meaning of this statement of their Rabb that they would treat an abscess or an eye with honey, not to mention other diseases of the body. According to reports about Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ ، even if an abscess showed up on his body, he would treat it by applying honey on it. When some of the people asked him as to why would he do that, he said in reply: Is it not that Allah Ta’ ala has said about it in the Holy Qur’ an: ~t.17 ~I a ; (In it, there is cure for people). (Al-Qurtubi)\nAllah Ta’ ala deals with His servants in harmony with the belief they have about their Rabb. It was said in Hadith Qudsi:\nاَنَا عِندَ ظَنِّ عَبدی بِی\nI am with the belief of My servant in Me.\nAl-Hadith Al-Qudsi: The Sanctified Hadith: A technical term for what has been communicated to the Holy Prophet by his Rabb. Its meanings are from Allah which He reveals for His Rases, through inspiration or dream, while its words are from the Rasul of Allah ﷺ .\nIn the last sentence of verse 69: إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُ‌ونَ (Surely, in that there is a sign for a people who ponder), Allah Ta’ ala has, after having given examples of His perfect power mentioned above, invited human beings once again to look into them and think about them. Allah Ta’ ala, by causing rains to come down, gives new life to dead lands. Winding through the impurities of feces and blood, He makes pipelines of pure and pleasant milk flow for you. On date-palms and grape-vines, He grows sweet fruits from which you make all sorts of syrups and pre-serves. Through a tiny little living creature with a poisonous bite, He pro-vides for you what is an excellent combination of food, drink, taste, flavor, and cure.\nWould you still keep calling gods and goddesses of your making? Would your worship and fidelity still remain detached from your real Creator and Master and attached to lifeless idols of stone and wood? Would your reason still keep looking for escape from truth by suggesting that this whole phenomena is some charismatic working of blind, deaf and inert matter? Face truth, think, realize. These countless masterpieces of Divine creativity, marvels of wisdom and design, and the finest of decisions based on absolute intelligence are the loudest of heralds announcing that our Creator is One, unique and wise, sole object of worship, obedience and fidelity. He alone is the remover par excellence of all difficulties and He alone deserves gratitude and glorification as due.\nSpecial Notes\n1.\tThe verse tells us that, beside human beings, there is consciousness and intelligence in other living creatures too: وَإِن مِّن شَيْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ (There is nothing which does not recite His praises - Al-Isra, 17:44). How-ever, the degrees of intelligence are different. The intelligence of human beings is more perfect than those of any other living creatures. This is the reason why they have been obligated with the precepts and injunctions of the Shari` ah. Again, this is the reason why a man or woman who does not remain rational due to insanity, does not remain so obligated very much like other creatures.\n2.\tAnother distinction of the honey bee is that the Hadith mentions its superiority. The Holy Prophet said: اَلذَّبانُ کُلُّھا فِی الںَّار یَجعَلُھَا عَذَاباً لِّاَھلِ النَّارِ اِلَّاالنَّحل\nAll bees will go to Hell (like other hurting creatures). They will be made a punishment for the people of Hell, except the honey bee (which will not go to Hell) - (Nawadir al-Usul with reference to Al-Qurtubi)\nAccording to another Hadith, he has prohibited its killing Abu Dawud.\n3.\tTraditional physicians doubt that honey is the excretion or saliva of the bee. Aristotle had placed bees in a hive made of glass and had closed it. He wished to find out their working system. But, these bees first mounted a curtain made with wax and mud on the inner side of the glass cage and did not start their work until such time that they became certain of having become totally veiled from sight.\nGiving an example of the lowness of worldly life, Sayyidna Ali ؓ said:\nاَشرَف لِبَاس بَنِی آدَمَ فِیہِ لُعَابُ دُدَۃِ وَّ اَشرفُ شَرَابِہ رَجِیعُ نَحلَۃِ\nThe finest dress of the progeny of Adam is saliva from a tiny in-sect and the finest of his drinks is the excrement of a bee.\n4. From the statement: فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ (in which, there is cure for people) we also find out that treating diseases with medicine is permissible because Allah Ta` ala has mentioned it as a reward and blessing.\nElsewhere it has been said: وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْ‌آنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَاءٌ وَرَ‌حْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ. and We send down from the Qur'an what is cure and mercy for believers - Al-Isra , 17:82). Hadith induces people to go for treament of diseases and use medicines. Some Companions asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ : Should we use medicine? He said: Why not? Do take advantage of treatment because for every disease Allah has created, He has also created a matching medicine. But, there is no cure for one disease. They asked: Which disease is that? He said: Extreme old age. (Abu Dawud  Tirmidhi from Al-Qurtubi)\nThere is yet another narration from Sayyidna Khuzaymah ؓ . He says: Once I asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ that the practice of blowing on the sick and seeking to cast off diseases which we are used to, or treat ourselves with medicines are the kind of arrangements we make to stay safe against diseases. Can these change the destiny determined by Allah Ta` ala? He said: These too are nothing but the very forms of Divinely-appointed destiny.\nTo sum up, there is consensus of all ` Ulama' on the justification of seeking treatment and using medicine. Many Ahadith and reports from the Sahabah are available in support. If one of the children of Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ was stung by a scorpion, he would give him an antidote and seek to help the child to get well through the benediction of supplicatory recitations. He treated a person suffering from partial paralysis by branding. (Al-Qurtubi)\nIt has been reported about some Muslim mystics (Sufiya' ) that they did not like being medically treated. This is also evident from the reported behaviour of some of the Sahabah as well. For instance, according to a report, Sayyidna Ibn Mas۔ ud ؓ fell sick. Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ came to visit him and asked him: What is it that ails you? He replied: I am worried about my sins. Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ said: Then, do you wish to have something? He said: I wish to have the mercy of my Rabb. Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ said: If you like I can call a physician? The answer he gave was: Believe me, it is the 'Physician' Himself who has put me down (on the sick bed).\nBut, occurrences of this nature do not go to prove that these blessed souls took medical treatment to be reprehensible (makruh). May be, at that time, it was not upto their personal taste and inclination. There-fore, it was because of their inability to accept it temperamentally that they did not favour to go by it. This is a transitory phase of psyche when one comes under the overwhelming logic and effect of the state one is in, and which cannot be used as an argument to prove that medical treatment is either impermissible or reprehensible. The very request made to Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ by Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ that he be allowed to bring a physician for him is, in itself, a proof of the fact that treatment is permissible - rather, there are situations when doing so becomes mandatory as well.",
