  "text": "Commentary\nPresented in the previous verses was a description of the great blessings of Allah Ta` ala as rational proof of His Oneness. This description of Divine blessings continues later on as well.\nIn between these two, the present verse (9) has been introduced parenthetically for the purpose of warning that Allah Ta’ ala, pursuant to His standing promise, has taken it upon Himself that He makes the straight path which takes its follower to Allah Ta’ ala clear and explicit. Therefore, the objective of the presentation of Divine blessings is to demonstrate proofs of the Being and Oneness of Allah Ta` ala.\nBut, counter to this, people have preferred to go by other crooked ways. It is unfortunate that, despite having clear signs and open proofs, they do not benefit by them. Instead, go on straying endlessly.\nAfter that it was said that Allah Ta’ ala, if He had so willed, would have made all of them to (compulsively) be on the right path. Had He done so, it was within His power. But, wisdom and expedient considerations required that there be no compulsion. Let the two paths be before everyone. Whoever elects to take whichever path should be free to take it. Everyone goes his or her way. The Straight Path (al-Sirat al-Mustaqim) will take people to Allah Ta’ ala and Jannah (Paradise). As for other crooked ways, they will take people to Jahannam (Hell). Human beings have been given the power to choose whichever path they wish to take.",
