  "text": "وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِشَهَادَاتِهِمْ قَائِمُونَ (...and those who are upright in their testimonies, [ 70:33] '. The word shahadat is the plural of shahadah. The use of plural number in this verse too indicates that there are many types and categories of 'testimony', and it is necessary to stand firm by one's testimony of any type. This includes testifying to the faith of Islam, Divine existence and His Oneness, and testifying that Sayyidna Muhammad ﷺ is His Final Messenger. It is obligatory to testify to the crescent of Ramadan, if one has seen it. Giving a true and accurate account of Shari'ah matters as expert witness, and in all judicial hearings is also implied. Everyone is duty-bound to offer the testimony when summoned. It is prohibited to add or omit any part thereof. According to this verse, it is obligatory to bear testimony, to be upright in it and stand firm by it.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Ma’ arij\nEnds here.",
