The preceding verse permitted to have sex with their wives and with slave-girls who are lawfully in their possession. The current verse prohibits sexual gratification beyond this limit. This verse also excludes women who, according to Shari'ah, fall within the prohibited degree. Similarly, Mut'ah (hiring a woman for a temporary period for the purpose of enjoying sex with her) is not a marriage according to Shari'ah, therefore, it is also included in the meaning of this verse.\nMasturbation is Forbidden\nAccording to most jurists, masturbation falls under the generality of verse [ 31], hence forbidden. Ibn Juraij says that he asked Sayyidna ` Ata' ؓ about it and the latter replied that it is makruh (reprehensible), adding that he heard that on the Plain of Hashr some people will come whose hands will be pregnant. He feels these will be the people who used to satisfy their sexual lust with their hands. Sayyidna Said Ibn Jubair ؓ says that Allah punished a nation who used to fondle with their private parts with their hands. A Hadith reports that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has said:\nمَلعون من نکح یدہ\n\"Cursed is he who marries his hand.\"\nThe chain of authorities of this Hadith is weak. [ Mazhari ].",
