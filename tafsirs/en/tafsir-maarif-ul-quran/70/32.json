  "text": "Rights of Allah and Rights of Human beings both are included in Trust Obligations\nوَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَ‌اعُونَ (and those who are careful about their trusts and covenants...70:32). The word amanat is the plural of amanah 'trust and covenant' as in:\nإِنَّ اللَّـهَ يَأْمُرُ‌كُمْ أَن تُؤَدُّوا الْأَمَانَاتِ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا\n'Surely, Allah commands you to fulfill trust obligations towards those entitled to them. [ 4:58] '\nThe use of plural number indicates that amanah does not only refer to 'that which people might deposit with a trustee for safe-keeping' but it also refers to 'all obligatory rights that are necessary to fulfill'. Breach of trusts and covenants is dishonesty. Trust obligations include all Divine rights, such as salah, siyam, hajj and zakah, as well as all human rights, such as rights that Allah has imposed between human beings, or human beings themselves might have entered into binding contracts and covenants. Fulfillment of them is obligatory. Failure to comply with their terms and conditions would amount to breach, or dishonesty. [ Mazhari، condensed ].",
