The word ha'umu, literally means, \"come\" but, idiomatically, it is used in the sense of the plural imperative verb khudhu \"take'. In other words, one who is given his record book in his right hand, he will be elated and, looking at the people around him, will say 'Here, take my account book and read it!'",
