  "text": "فَلَيْسَ لَهُ الْيَوْمَ هَاهُنَا حَمِيمٌ وَلَا طَعَامٌ إِلَّا مِنْ غِسْلِينٍ (So, he has no friend here today, nor any food except from that which flows from wounds when washing...69:35-36]. The word hamim means 'a sincere or bosom friend'. The word ghislin with 'gh' bearing the kasrah [= i ] refers to the water with which the pus and blood of the wounds of the inmates of Hell will be washed. The verses signify that on the Day of Resurrection he will have no friend that will support him or save him from punishment, nor will he have anything to eat except the filthy water with which pus exuding from the wound of the inmates of Hell might have been washed. The words 'nor any food' mean that they will not have any delectable food to eat. This statement does not negate things like ghislin which are distasteful and reprehensible. Therefore, it does not contradict another verse which states that the inmates of Hell will eat zaqqum.",
