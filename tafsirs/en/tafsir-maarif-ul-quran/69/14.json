  "text": "فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ‌ نَفْخَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ (Then, when the Trumpet will be blown for the first time…69:13). Tirmidhi records a Hadith on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ that صور sur 'trumpet' is a horn- like object which will be blown on Doomsday.\nنَفْخَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ ('for the first time…69:13). It means that it will be a sudden and a single continuing sound that will last until all die. The texts of Qur'an and Sunnah show that the trumpet will be blown twice on the Day of Judgment. The first trumpet is called nafkhat-us-sa` aq 'the trumpet of swoon', in connection with which the Qur'an says:\nفَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ\nAnd all those in the heavens and all those in the earth will faint... [ 39:68]\nWith this trumpet all angels residing in the heavens and all Jinns and human beings and animals residing on earth will become unconscious and fall to the ground. Whilst they are in the state of unconsciousness, they will die. The second trumpet is called nafkhat-ul-ba` th 'trumpet of Resurrection'. The word bath means 'to rise'. With this trumpet all the dead will rise from death and stand up. The Qur'an describes this situation thus:\nثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَ‌ىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُ‌ونَ\nThereafter, it will be blown once again, and suddenly they will stand up, looking around. [ 39:68]\nIn other words, then the trumpet will be blown a second time and at once they will be standing upright looking on.\nAccording to some narratives, a third 'trumpet' will also be blown before the two trumpets, which is referred to as nafkhat-ul-faza` ('the trumpet of fright or panic). By a careful analysis of all the narratives and texts, it appears that the first trumpet in its initial stage is nafthat-ul-faza' and in its final stage it will become sa` aq 'the trumpet of swoon or death'.
