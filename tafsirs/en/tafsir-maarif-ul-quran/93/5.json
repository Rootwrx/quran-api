  "text": "وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَ‌بُّكَ فَتَرْ‌ضَىٰ (And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you will be pleased....93:5). Allah does not specify here what he will give him. The statement is open and general. The Holy Prophet ﷺ will be granted everything he desires so much that he will be pleased. Among his desired thing is the progress of Islam; the general spread of Islam in the world; fulfillment of every need of the Ummah; triumph of the Holy Prophet himself over his enemies and raising the word of Allah in the land of the enemy. When this verse was revealed, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nاِذا ! لّا اَرضٰی وَ وَاحدُ مِّن اُمَّتِی فِی النَّار\n'If that is the case, then I will not be pleased as long as one [ single member ] of my Ummah [ remains ] in Fire.' [ Qurtubi ].\nIn a narration by Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"Allah will accept my intercession for my Ummah [ community ]. Allah will ask: رضیتَ یا محمد '0 Muhammad, are you pleased?' He will reply: یا رَبِّ رَضِیتُ \"My Lord, I am pleased.\" Muslim records from Sayyidna ` Amr Ibn-ul-` As to the effect that the Holy Prophet ﷺ recited a verse concerning the Prophet Ibrahim : (علیہ السلام)\nفَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ‌ رَّ‌حِيمٌ\n'...So, one who followsme is surely mine, and the one who\ndisobeys me, then You are Most Forgiving, Very Merciful. [ 14:36] '\nThen he recited a verse which contains the words of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام)\nإِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ\n'If You punish them, then, they are Your slaves [ 5:118] '\nThen he raised his hands, he wept and prayed:\nاَللّٰھُمَّ اُمَّتِی اُمَّتِی\n'0 Allah, my ummah, my ummah!'\nAllah sent Jibra'il\tعلیہ السلام to inquire as to why he was weeping [ while Allah knows the reason ]. Jibra'il Amin\tعلیہ السلام came and inquired why he was weeping. The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied: \"I seek my ummah's forgiveness.\" Allah sent Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) back to inform him that He has pardoned them, and that Allah would please him and would not displease him regarding his ummah.",
