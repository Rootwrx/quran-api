And surely, it is an unassailable book that cannot be approached by falsehood, neither from its front, nor from its behind. - 41:41-42) Most Exegetes have stated that the ` advice' in this verse refers to the Qur'an, and the sentence \"those who have rejected the advice when it came to them\" is a complement of the former phrase \"those who go crooked about Our verse\" and hence, according to Arabic grammar, is subject to the same predicate, and thus the meaning is that these people cannot be hidden from Us, and consequently cannot escape the scourge. Further on is stated that the Qur'an is protected by Allah. إِنَّهُ لَكِتَابٌ عَزِيزٌ (And surely, it is an unassailable book) meaning that Allah Almighty holds this Book dear and fully protected; no falsehood can enter this Book. (Narrated by Ibn ` Abbas - Mazhari)",
