  "text": "Commentary\nفَذُو دُعَاءٍ عَرِ‌يضٍ (he is full of broad prayers - 51.) The nature of an infidel is being stated here that when Allah Almighty bestows upon him the good things: wealth, honor and peace, the infidel gets so involved in them and so intoxicated with them that he becomes even more distant from the true Benefactor, Allah Almighty, and his pride and heedlessness increase even more. But when he faces some distress, then he starts long and lengthy supplications to Allah Almighty. Here the Qur'an has used the word ` broad' to describe their lengthy supplications, because what is wider will automatically be longer too. That is why, when describing the span of Paradise, Allah Almighty has used the word عَرْ‌ضُهَا السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْ‌ضُ (a paradise the width of which spans the heavens and the earth - 3: 133)\nLengthy supplications in themselves are praiseworthy and desirable as is proved by authentic ahadith about the etiquettes of supplication where it is mentioned that, while praying to Allah Ta’ ala, beseeching tearfully and repeatedly is desirable. (Bukhari and Muslim) Therefore, the denunciation of the infidel is actually not for lengthy supplications, but for his mean disposition that when Allah blesses him with His bounties, he gets intoxicated with arrogance and pride, and when he faces distress, he keeps on praying in a way of wailing and complaining about his difficulties, as is the habit of heedless people; the intent is not to supplicate, but to wail about his misfortunes and to keep on telling the people about it. (Allah knows best).",
