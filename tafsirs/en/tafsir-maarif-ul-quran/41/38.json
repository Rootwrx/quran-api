  "text": "وَهُمْ لَا يَسْأَمُونَ (and they do not get weary. - 38) This is one of the verses called ` Verses of sajdah' the recitation of which makes it obligatory to perform sajdah (prostration) for the one who recites them and the one who listens to them. This sajdah is called sajdah of tilawah. There is consensus of the Ummah on the point that sajdah of tilawah is wajib (obligatory) in this Surah, but the scholars differ regarding the exact place where it becomes wajib. Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn-ul-` Arabi has written in Ahkam-ul-Qur'an that Sayyidna ` Aliand Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ used to prostrate at the end of the verse 37 i.e. at the end ofإِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ (if it is Him whom you worship.) Imam Malik has adopted this very stance. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، however, used to prostrate at the end of the verse 38 i.e. at the end of لَا يَسْأَمُونَ ۩ (and they do not get weary.)\nSayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ has also advised prostration at this place. Masruq, Abu ` Abdur Rahman Sulami, Ibrahim Nakha` i, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, etc., and most jurists used to prostrate at verse 38, i.e. at the end of لَا يَسْأَمُونَ ۩. Imam Abu Bakr Jassas has said in Ahkam-ul-Qur'an that this has been the view of all the leading Hanafi scholars. He has further said that in view of the differences, it is on the safer side to prostrate at the end of the verse 38, because even if prostration becomes wajib at the end of the verse 37, then the obligation would be discharged if it is performed after the recitation of the verse 38, and if it becomes wajib at the verse 38, then, the discharge of obligation (if it is performed after verse 38) is more obvious.",
