  "text": "It is Not permissible to prostrate before anyone except Allah Almighty\nلَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ‌ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّـهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ (Do not make sajdah [ prostration ] to the sun, or to the moon. And make sajdah to Allah who has created them - 37). It is learnt from this verse that prostration is the right of the Creator of the Universe only. The consensus of the Ummah is that to prostrate before any star, human being, etc. is haram (forbidden), whether it is for worship, or just as a gesture of respect and reverence. The only difference is that if someone prostrates before anyone other than Allah with intention to worship him, he becomes an infidel and the one who prostrates simply as a mark of respect and reverence is not called an infidel, but he is guilty of committing a serious haram act and is a sinner.\nProstration of worship for any being other than Allah has never been lawful for any Ummah in any Shari` ah of any prophet, because it becomes a practice of shirk (polytheism) and shirk has never been allowed in any code of shari'ah revealed to any prophet. However, prostration in respect and reverence of anyone (with no intention to worshipping him) had been allowed in the codes of shari'ah revealed to some prophets. All the angels were ordered to prostrate before Sayyidna 'Adam (علیہ السلام) before he came into this world. It is stated in the Qur'an that the father and brothers of Sayyidna Yusuf (علیہ السلام) prostrated before him. But the jurisprudents of this Ummah are unanimous on the point that such a prostration was permissible in the earlier codes only, and it stands abrogated in Islam. Prostration for any being other than Allah has been declared absolutely haram (forbidden). Full details of this issue are given in the author's booklet ( المقالۃ المرضیۃ فی حکم سجدۃ التحیۃ) Al-maqalat-ulmardiyyah, fi Hukmi sajdat-it-tahiyyah' in Arabic, and its Urdu translation has also been published.",
