It is to be noted that by that time Torah was not revealed to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) . Therefore it cannot be Torah which was denied. Hence it is either the proofs of the Oneness of Allah, which can be understood by any one according to his mental level, or the traditions of the past prophets which are passed on through generations, no matter in what little detail, are referred here as rejection of His message. The same thing is referred in Qur'an as well وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ يُوسُفُ مِن قَبْلُ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ (Joseph brought you the clear signs before - 40:34). It mentions about the teachings of the earlier prophets, which had also reached them. (Bayan ul-Quran)",
