There is a difference of opinion among the commentators whether this complaint of the Holy Prophet ﷺ to Allah Ta’ ala about his people would be on Dooms Day or was made in his life time. Both views appear valid. But the verse following this verse suggests that he made this complaint during his lifetime and the next verse was revealed to appease him.",
