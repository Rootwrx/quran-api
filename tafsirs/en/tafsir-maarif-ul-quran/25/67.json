  "text": "The Sixth Characteristic\nوَالَّذِينَ إِذَا أَنفَقُوا لَمْ يُسْرِ‌فُوا وَلَمْ يَقْتُرُ‌وا (and those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor miserly - 25:67). That is Allah's blessed servants are neither spendthrifts nor misers but they spend moderately. The words اسراف (israf, i.e. extravagance) and إقتَار (iqtar, i.e. miserliness) are used in the verse for the two opposite traits. Israf means to cross the limits. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Juraij رحمۃ اللہ علیہم any spending on something sinful, however little it may be, is israf, while others say that even overspending in the rightful and allowed things which is wasteful would fall under the definition of israf. It is because any wasteful spending is by itself a sin and hence israf. Allah Ta’ ala has said إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِ‌ينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ (Surely squanderers are brothers of Shaitan - 17:27). In this way the latter explanation is also covered in the explanation given by Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that is any spending on some sinful thing is\tاِسرَاف . (Mazhari)\nاِقتَار (iqtar) means to spend with miserliness. In Islamic jurisprudence it means to be tight fisted where a believer is directed to spend. In case one does not spend at all at a place where he has been directed to spend, then that is the worst situation. This explanation is also given by Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Qatadah etc. (Mazhari) Therefore, the message of the verse is that Allah's blessed servants are neither spendthrifts nor misers but in the matter of spending they take the middle path.\nThere is a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ :\nمِن فِقہِ الرَّجُلِ قَصدُہ ، فِی مَعِیشَتِہٖ\nThat is \"It is the sagacity of man to adopt the middle path in spending\" In another Saying quoted by\nSayyidna Abdullah Ibn Masud the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nمَا عال من اقتصد\nThat is \"The person who sticks to the middle path and moderation in spending will never become a destitute and poor\".
