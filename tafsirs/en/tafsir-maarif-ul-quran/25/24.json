Permanent residence is called مُّسْتَقَرًّ while مَقِيلً is derived from قَیلُولہ which means siesta. Hence مَقِيلً means the place for having siesta. Probably مَقِيلً is specifically mentioned here because it is referred in one of the traditions that on the Dooms day Allah Ta’ ala will complete reckoning of the entire creation by noon and the people of paradise will reach Paradise at the time of siesta and so will the condemned in the Hell.
