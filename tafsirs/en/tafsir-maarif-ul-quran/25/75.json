The righteous people having special closeness to Allah will be given high chambers in Paradise which will look like stars to common people. (al-Bukhari, Muslim, Mazhari)\nIt is narrated in Musnad of Ahmad, Bayhaqi, Tirmidhi and Hakim on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Malik al-Ash'ari that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said \"In Paradise there will be such upper Houses that their interior could be seen from outside and the exterior from inside\". Sahabah inquired from him as to who will live in them. Then he replied \"Those who keep their speech clean and soft, greet every Muslim, feed the poor, and offer Tahajjud prayers at night when others are sleeping.\" (Mazhari)\nوَيُلَقَّوْنَ فِيهَا تَحِيَّةً وَسَلَامًا (And will be received therein with prayers of their eternal life and peace - 25:75). That is beside other boons of Paradise they will have the honour that angels will greet and felicitate them.\nUpto this point the traits and deeds of the sincere believers and their rewards and recompense were described. Then in the last verse the infidels and disbelievers have been warned again of the chastisement on which the Surah is concluded.",
