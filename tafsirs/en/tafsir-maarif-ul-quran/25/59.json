In this verse it is described that the creation of the earth and the skies, and then to place Himself on ` Arsh in consonance to His exalted position are all acts of Allah Ta’ ala. If someone wants its confirmation, he should find out from those who know the truth. Here the allusion for knowledge is toward Allah Ta’ ala or Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) . It is also possible that the reference is toward the scholars of the previous Books wherein the truth was also mentioned. (Mazhari)",
