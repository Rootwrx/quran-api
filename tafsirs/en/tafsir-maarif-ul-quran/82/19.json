This does not negate intercession, because that will not happen with one's own free will, unless Allah grants permission to someone to intercede on someone's behalf, and then accepts the intercession. And all matters, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone). [ 19] ' Allah knows best! Al-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Infitar\nEnds here",
