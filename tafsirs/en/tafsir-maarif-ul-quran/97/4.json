  "text": "Descent of the Angels and the Spirit with Divine Decrees\nVerse [ 4] نَزَّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّ‌وحُ (The angels and the Spirit descend in it, with the leave of their Lord, along with every command.) 'Spirit' here refers to Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) .\nSayyidna Anas ؓ narrates that the Messenger of Allah\tﷺ said: \"When the Night of Qadr occurs, Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) descends on the earth with a huge throng of angels and all of them pray for every servant of Allah, man or woman, busy in salah or dhikr, to be blessed by Allah.\" [ Mazhari ]. In the phrase مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ‌ (along with every command), the preposition min is used in the sense of 'with' as in [ 13:11] يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ‌ اللَّـهِ. The verse under comment means the angels bring down, during the Night of Qadr, the decree for everything destined to occur in the coming year. Some of the commentators, like Mujahid and others, say that the phrase مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ‌min kulli amrin is syntactically related to salam, and the word Amr means 'everything'. Thus they interpret the statement to mean: 'The night is a security from every evil, harm and calamity.' [ Ibn Kathir ].",
