  "text": "First, the special marks of the inmates of Hell are described. They have two characteristics:\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَىٰ وَآثَرَ‌ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا (then for the one who had rebelled, and preferred the worldly life [ to the Hereafter ]...79:38). In other words, [ 1] instead of remaining loyal to Allah and His Messenger and following their commands, they adopt the line of rejection and rebellion; and [ 2] prefer the life of this world to that of the Hereafter. In other words, if he were to do a deed that gives comfort and pleasure in this world but punishment in the Hereafter, he would prefer the comforts and pleasure of this life to the pleasure of the next life. Those who are characterised by these two qualities the Blazing Fire, that is Hell, will be their abode, thus: فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ (the Hell will be the abode... 79:39).",
