Surely Allah is to accomplish His purpose. Allah has set a measure for everything....65:3) ۔ In this verse Allah promises those who put their trust in Him that He shall suffice for them against all odds, because Allah will execute His decisions that He made for them, in whatever way He wills and chooses. Allah set a measure for all things. It is in accordance with this set measure that He decrees all acts. Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah record from Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:\nلو اَنّکم توکّلتم علی اللہ حقّ توکّلہٖ لرزقکم کما یرزق الطّیر تغدوا خماصاً وتروح\n\"If you trust in Allah as He ought to be trusted, He will provide for you in the same way as He provides for the birds. They leave their nests while hungry in the mornings, but come back in the evenings with their bellies full.\"\nSahihs of Bukhari and Muslim transmit on the authority of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: \"Seventy-thousand of my followers will be admitted to Paradise without account.\" Among their other qualities, they will be characterised by having trust in Allah.\" [ Mazhari ]\nTawakkul (Trust in Allah) does not mean to forsake the causes and means Allah has created for us to acquire things. One should utilise the means at our disposal. However, instead of relying solely on them, one should rather put his trust in Allah, in that no task shall be accomplished unless Allah wills it. After describing the virtues and blessings of taqwa and Twakkul, the next verses lay down some more rules about divorce and \"iddah.",
