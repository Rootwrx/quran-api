  "text": "Verse [ 8 - the concluding phrase ] ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ رَ‌بَّهُ (…That is for him who has awe of his Lord.) The word 'fear' or 'awe' here is not used in the sense of an 'agitated, disturbed or perturbed feeling' which we naturally have for an enemy, a beast, a ferocious animal or an obnoxious thing that might harm us. 'Khashyatullah' (Allah's awe) is, on the contrary, a feeling of deep, reverential awe that leads man to Allah's obedience. It is the awe of Allah's Majesty and His Incomparability that makes the perfect slave do every work under every circumstance to attain the Divine pleasure and evade every occasion of His displeasure. This is the axis on which rotates the religious perfection and all bounties of the Hereafter.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Al-Bayyinah\nEnds here",
