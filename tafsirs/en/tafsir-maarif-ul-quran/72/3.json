The word jadd means 'majesty/glory' used for Allah. Instead of saying .jadduhu' with a third person pronoun referring to Allah, the attributive name 'rabb' 'Lord' is expressly retained which indicates the exalted position of Allah. The Being who is the Cherisher and sustainer of His creation must, of necessity, occupy the lofty position. Commentators have discussed the grammatical conjunctive construction 'wa annahu' at length in this verse. It might be of no interest to the general readers.",
