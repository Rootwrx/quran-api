Therefore, the Qur'an has used the word 'mathal' for Allah Ta’ ala at several places, as in this very verse, and in another but Allah Ta’ ala's Being is completely beyond resemblance. (That is why the word 'mathal' has been translated above as 'attribute', which is also a possible lexical meaning of the word.)",
