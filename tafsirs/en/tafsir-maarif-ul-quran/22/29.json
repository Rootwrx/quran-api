  "text": "ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُوا (Then, they must remove their dirt - 22:29) The word تَفَث means dirt, which gathers on human body. While a person is in the state of ihram, he cannot shave, trim or pluck his hair, nor can he pare his nails, nor use perfume, and it is quite natural that dirt should collect under his hair and nails and on his body. This verse requires of the pilgrims that after they have performed the sacrifice, they should remove this dirt, meaning thereby that they should now remove the ihram, (and wear their normal clothes) shave their heads and pare their nails. This verse mentions sacrifice first and then refers to the removal of the dirt, which suggests that these two acts must be performed in that order. It is forbidden to shave one's head or pare nails before the obligatory sacrifice. Anyone who does so must slaughter an animal as دَم dam (to atone for his sin).\nObservance of the correct sequence in the performance of various acts related to Hajj\nThe observance of various functions of Hajj in the same order in which they are mentioned in the Qur'an and hadith, and which have been codified by the jurists is, by consensus, a sunnah. However, opinions differ whether it is obligatory as well. Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) and Imam Malik (رح) hold the view that the observance of the sequence is obligatory and any deviation from it must be atoned for by دَم dam, while according to Imam Shafi'i (رح) it is only sunnah and a deviation from it reduces the reward to be gained by performing Hajj but does not make it obligatory to sacrifice an animal. There is also a ruling of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ مَن قَدَّم شیٔاً من نسکہ او اخّرہ فلیھرق دما (He who alters the sequence of the rites during Hajj must slaughter an animal). (Mazhari) Tahawi has also reported this tradition through different versions. In addition Sayyidna Said Ibn Jubair ؓ ، Qatadah, Nakha` i and Hasan al-Basri also support the view that any alteration in the sequence of the rites of Hajj makes the sacrifice of an animal obligatory. Fuller details on the subject are discussed in the Tafsir Mazhari.\nوَلْيُوفُوا نُذُورَ‌هُمْ (And fulfill their vows - 22:29) نُذُور is the plural of the word نَذَر ، which means a ` vow'. When a person commits himself verbally to do an act, in order to win the goodwill of Allah Ta’ ala, (which is not otherwise obligatory on him) it becomes a vow (nadhr) and its performance becomes obligatory for him by consensus of Ummah, provided that the act itself is not sinful or forbidden. If a person makes a vow to do something which is sinful, then he is not bound to fulfill the vow, rather it is impermissible to act upon it, but he must make atonement for the unfulfilled vow. According to Abu Hanifah (رح) and other religious jurists the vow must be of an act which is an act of a direct worship (` ibadah maqsudah) in some manner. So, if someone makes a nadhr (vow) for voluntary prayers, fasting, sadaqah, sacrifice, of animals etc. all these vows must be fulfilled in all circumstances. The present verse emphasizes on this very issue.\nRuling\nIt must be remembered that a resolve made in one's heart to do something does not become a nadhr (vow) unless it is pronounced with the tongue. Tafsfr Mazhari has elaborated the rules of nadhr in great detail.\nA question and its answer\nOne may question the relevance of nadhr in the context of Hajj. Obviously the preceding sentences speak of the rules of Hajj, like sacrifice, removing ihram etc. Similarly, the following sentence relates to the tawaf of ziyarah. Why the injunction to fulfill vows has been inserted between the rules of Hajj, while the rules governing vows have an independent status which are to be fulfilled at all times and at every place and not during Hajj only?\nA possible explanation for this is that when a person sets out with the intention of performing Hajj, his heart prompts him to do the maximum number of good deeds and to spend the maximum time in prayers, and so he makes many vows, specially it was a common practice to make vows for sacrificing additional animals during Hajj. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ the word nadhr in this context means a vow to sacrifice an animal. One relevance of nadhr (vow) appearing with the rites of pilgrimage is that just as vow makes many things obligatory which are not so otherwise and makes many things unlawful for him which are not originally forbidden, similarly the state of ihram, during a pilgrimage makes certain things unlawful for him which are permitted at other times. Instances of these are: wearing stitched clothes, use of perfume, shaving of hair or paring nails. Therefore, Sayyidna ` Ikrimah ؓ has interpreted nadhr in this verse to mean those acts and duties which have become obligatory during the course of Hajj.\nوَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا بِالْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ (And they should make tawaf of the ancient House - 22:29) Here the word tawaf refers to tawaf-uz-ziyarah, which is performed on the 10th day of the month of Zil Hijj after casting stones and making the sacrifice. It is the second obligatory ritual of Hajj, the first being wuquf-ul-` Arafat, which is performed earlier. After this tawaf the state of ihram is fully terminated and all restrictions are removed. (Rah ul-Ma ani)\nThe word الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ lexically means 'liberated house' Baitullah is called الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ , because according to the Holy Prophet ﷺ it has been liberated from the control and domination of the infidels and tyrants and it will never again be ruled by them. (رواہ الترمذی وحسنہ والحاکم وصححہ وابن جریر والطبرانی۔Ruh ul-Ma'ani). It is evident by the episode of the People of Elephant who, with all their might, were frustrated in their attempt to establish their dominion over Makkah.1\n1. The other meaning of the word عَتِیق is 'ancient' which is adopted in the translation of the text. (Editor)",
