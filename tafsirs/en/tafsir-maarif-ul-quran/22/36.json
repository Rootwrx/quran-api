  "text": "وَالْبُدْنَ جَعَلْنَاهَا لَكُم مِّن شَعَائِرِ‌ اللَّـهِ (And the big animals of sacrifice [ like camels ] are made by Us among the symbols of Allah for you - 22:36.) It has been explained earlier that شَعَائِرِ‌ (symbols) mean those special forms of rites and worship, which are the symbols of Islam. Sacrifice of animals is one of them, which must be observed with due importance.\nفَاذْكُرُ‌وا اسْمَ اللَّـهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَافَّ (So recite the name of Allah over them as they are lined up (for sacrifice) - 22:36) The word صَوَافَّ (translated above as 'lined up' ) is used for مَصفوُفہ ، which means standing in a row. According to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ the verse means that the camel, which is to be slaughtered, should stand on three legs and one foreleg should be bent and tied up. This is a better way of slaughtering a camel and is according to sunnah. Other animals should be slaughtered in lying position, which is also sunnah.\nmmmm\nفَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا (Then, once their flanks fall down). Here the word\t; وَجَبَتْ is used for the meaning of سَقَطَت ، which means when the animal falls and dies.\nالْقَانِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ‌ (the one who is content and the one who wishes to receive) In an earlier verse people who have a right on the meat of sacrificed animals have been described by the words بَایٔس فَقِیر ، which mean destitute and without means. These two words have been clarified further by the words قَانِعَ and مُعْتَرَّ‌. The word قَانِعَ applies to a needy person who does not solicit and is content with what people offer him voluntarily. While مُعْتَرَّ‌is a person who goes to a place where he expects to receive something, whether he solicits verbally or not. (Mazhari)",
