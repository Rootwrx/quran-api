  "text": "لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى (And for you there are benefits in them upto a specified time - 22:33). It means that it is lawful for the Muslims to use the quadruped animals for their benefit (such as using their milk, riding them or using them for transport of goods) unless the animals have been made ھَدِی (Hady) by reserving them for sacrifice to be offered within the precincts of haram. When a person takes along with him an animal for the specific purpose of sacrificing it within haram, the animal is described as hady, and no benefit may be derived from it, except in extreme emergency. A person leading a camel after it has been nominated as hady may lawfully ride it only if he is unable to walk and no other mount is available.\nثُمَّ مَحِلُّهَا إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ (Then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House - 22:33) Here الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ includes the entire precincts of haram, as was the case in the previous verse where the word Al-Masjid Al-Haram was used for the entire area of haram, and mahill (place) means the place of slaughtering the animals of hady. Thus the entire haram is declared as the slaughtering place of the animals of hady. The meaning of the verse is that the hady (animals nominated for sacrifice during Hajj) may be slaughtered within, and not outside the area of haram which includes Mina and all other places of Makkah.
