  "text": "Commentary\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ جَعَلْنَا مَنسَكًا (And for every Ummah We prescribed the act of sacrifice 22:34) The words مَنسَكً and نسَكً means several things in Arabic such as sacrifice of animals, the rites of pilgrimage, and also worship of Allah Ta’ ala. This word has been used in the Qur'an at several places and conveys one of the three meanings. In the present context, the word can carry all the three meanings. Mujahid and some other commentators think that here the word مَنسَكً refers to the sacrifice of the animals in which case the verse would mean that the obligation to offer sacrifice, which has been placed on this Ummah is nothing new, because all the other peoples were likewise bound to do so. On the other hand, according to Qatadah the word means the rites of the pilgrimage, and thus the verse would mean that these rites which have been prescribed for the present Ummah were made obligatory on the people of earlier ages also. Ibn ` Arafah has interpreted the word مَنسَكً to mean worship of Allah, and so the meaning of the verse would be that the worship of Allah was made obligatory on all the peoples of bygone ages and though there were differences in the forms of worship, yet in essence it remained unchanged.\nوَبَشِّرِ‌ الْمُخْبِتِينَ (And give good news to those who turn to Him in humbleness). The word\t خَبت means ‘a depressed tract of land’ and means ` a person who deems himself humble and lowly'. According to ` Amr bin Aws مُخْبِتِينَ are those people who do not wrong others and if somebody wrongs them, they do not seek revenge. Sufyan has observed that they are the people who are contented with Allah's will and remain agreeable in all circumstances, comfort or trouble and poverty or affluence.",
