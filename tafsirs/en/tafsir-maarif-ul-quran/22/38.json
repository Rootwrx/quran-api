  "text": "Commentary\nThe previous verses contain an account of how the infidels of Makkah prevented the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions from entering the Haram and the Holy Mosque to perform ` Umrah when, having put on ihram, they had reached as far as Hudaibiyah, a place not far from Makkah. In this verse Allah Ta’ ala consoled the Muslims with the promise that He would deprive the infidels of their power to harm them anymore.\nThis incident took place in the year 6 A.H. and thereafter the power and the morale of the infidels suffered continuous decline until in the year 8 A.H. the Muslims conquered Makkah. The following verses describe this event in detail.",
