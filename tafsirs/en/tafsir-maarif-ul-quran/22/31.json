  "text": "Commentary\nحُرُ‌مَاتِ اللَّـهِ (22:30) are the things sanctified by Allah Ta’ ala, that is the religious laws. They are a source of welfare in this world and in the Hereafter for those pious Muslims who seek to learn them and act upon them.\nوَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ (And permitted to you are the cattle, except those mentioned to you through recitation (of the verses) - 22:30) The word اَنعَام (cattle) includes camels, cows, goats, sheep etc. which are made lawful at all times and even when one is in the state of ihram. Then the verse contains an exception in the words إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ (except those mentioned to you.. - 22:30) These are the animals which have been made unlawful in all circumstances, whether one is in the state of ihram or not. The detail of these animals is given in other verses, such as carrion, an animal which is beaten to death, or slaughtered without reciting the name of Allah, or in the name of someone other than Allah.\nفَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّ‌جْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ (So refrain from the filth of the idols - 22:30) The word رِجس means filth or moral impurity, and أَوْثَانِ is the plural of وَثَن which means idol. Idols have been described as filth, because they fill a man's heart and soul with moral impurity.\nوَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ‌ (And refrain from a word of falsehood - 22:30) The phrase قَوْلَ الزُّورِ‌ means lies. Anything which is contrary to truth is a lie and false, whether it is corrupt beliefs and practices or whether it is false evidence. The Holy Prophet ﷺ\tonce said ` Among the major sins are associating anyone with Allah, disobedience of one's parents, giving false evidence and telling lies in general talk'. He used the phrase; قَوْلَ الزُّورِ‌ (word of falsehood) repeatedly. (Bukhari)",
