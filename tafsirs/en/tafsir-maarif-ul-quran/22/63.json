  "text": "Commentary\nIn an earlier verse it has been mentioned that Allah Ta’ ala helps those who are wronged unjustly وَإِنَّ اللَّـهَ عَلَىٰ نَصْرِ‌هِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ‌ (Allah is powerful to give them victory - 22:39) Some people bear their sufferings patiently and do not seek vengeance from their oppressors, but there are others who retaliate and serve a full measure of retribution on their oppressors which should, therefore, place them both on even terms as being quits. But if the oppressor, incensed at the retaliation, attacks him again, then this person once again becomes the victim of oppression. This verse promises Allah's help for such a person also. On the other hand there are several verses which promise Allah's goodwill to those Muslims who bear their sufferings with patience and equanimity and do not seek vengeance from their oppressors. Some of these verses are:\nفَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُ‌هُ عَلَى اللَّـهِ\nBut whoso pardons and puts things right, his wage falls upon Allah - 42:40.\nوَلَمَن صَبَرَ‌ وَغَفَرَ‌ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ‌\nAnd that you forgive is closer to Taqwa - 2:237.\nBut surely he who bears patiently and forgives - surely that is true constancy - 42:43.\nIn all these verses it is encouraged not to retaliate for revenge and rather forgive and forget, which is a magnanimous way of dealing with fellow human beings. This is the way Qur'anic teachings stand and call it a supreme and superior trait. Thus it may perhaps be argued that the person who retaliates against the wrongs done to him and conducts himself contrary to the course of action preferred by Allah Ta’ ala will be deprived of His support and help. But this doubt has been allayed in the final part of this verseإِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ‌ (22:60) that is, Allah will not punish him for this lapse and will help him if he is subjected to injustice by his oppressors ever again.
