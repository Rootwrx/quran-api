This verse was revealed with particular reference to Nadr Ibn al-Harith, who was a very quarrelsome person. He claimed that the angels were Allah's daughters, and that the Qur'an was a storybook, which contained fables about people of bygone ages. He denied the Day of Judgment and the Resurrection of the dead. Although this verse relates to a particular person, its message applies to all who are in a similar situation, and practice such wickedness",
