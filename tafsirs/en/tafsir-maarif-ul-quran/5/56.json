  "text": "In other words, it is said here that those who obey the commands of Allah are the People of Allah. Given to them is the good news that they will be the ones to finally overcome. The events which unfolded later on confirmed the veracity of this statement when everyone saw that the noble Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, overcame all powers which threatened them. When internal rebellions challenged Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ ، Allah Almighty helped him prevail over all of them. When the towering powers of Ceaser and Cyrus marshaled their menacing might against Sayyidna ` Umar al-Faruq ؓ ، Allah Almighty effaced them from the face of the earth. Then, as long as these injunctions were dutifully observed by the Khulafa' and Muslims at large who came after them - by abstaining from establishing close bonds of friendship with non-Muslims - they had always remained winners in the struggle of life.",
