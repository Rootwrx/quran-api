  "text": "Commentary\nReferring to the Jews and Christians in: أَكْثَرَ‌كُمْ فَاسِقُونَ (most of you are sinners) at the end of the first verse, ` most' - not ` all'- of them have been declared to be outside the fold of Faith. The reason for this is that they did have people among them who remained believers under all conditions. Before the coming of the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tall they followed the injunctions of the Torah and Injil and believed in them. When the Holy Prophet ﷺ came and the Qur'an was revealed, they believed in him too and started following the injunctions of the Qur'an.",
