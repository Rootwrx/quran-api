  "text": "Another negative and detrimental aspect of conduct against which warning has been given in verse 47 and from which abstinence has been advised is that believers should not wax proud over their strength and numbers nor should they be guilty of nursing some per-sonal interest of theirs rather than remaining sincere to their mission at hand, because these two approaches would usually bring down great powers of the world on their knees.\nEmbedded in this verse, there is an allusion to the circumstances under which the Quraysh of Makkah who had marched off from their city to give military cover to their trade caravan with the heavy backing of men and materials and waxing proud over their number and strength. And even when the trade caravan had passed far beyond the range of any possible attack by Muslims, they elected not to return even then - because, they had other axes to grind by giving a little demonstration of their valour on the site of combat.\nAccording to authentic reports, when Abu Sufyan succeeded in getting past the range of Muslim attack with his trade caravan, he sent a courier to Abu Jahl bearing the message that there was no need for him to go any further and that he should better return. Many other Quraysh chiefs had also concurred with this advice. But, driven by his pride, arrogance and the desire for recognition, Abu Jahl declared on oath that they would not return until they reach the site of Badr and celebrate their victory there for a few days.\nThe outcome was that he and his well-known accomplices found themselves dumped there forever. Muslims have been instructed to abstain from the methods adopted by them.",
