  "text": "In the second verse (64) as well, by stating the same subject briefly, the Holy Prophet ï·º has been comforted by telling him that sufficient for him is Allah Ta` ala in the real sense, and the group of believers in the physical sense. So, he should have no fear of an enemy, no matter how big, strong, numerous or well-equipped. Commentators have said that this verse was revealed before actual fighting started in the battle of Badr so that Muslims, small in numbers and virtually unequipped, would not be overawed by the heavy numerical and technical superiority of their adversary.",
