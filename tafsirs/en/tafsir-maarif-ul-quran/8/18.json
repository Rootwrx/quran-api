  "text": "In contrast to this, yet another benefit which came out of this victory has been described in the fourth verse as: ذَٰلِكُمْ وَأَنَّ اللَّـهَ مُوهِنُ كَيْدِ الْكَافِرِ‌ينَ ﴿18﴾ (Apart from that, Allah is the One who frustrates the device of the disbelievers - 18). In other words, it can be said that Muslims were blessed with this victory for yet another reason, that is, the plans of the disbelievers should be rendered ineffective through it, something which would make them understand that Divine support is not with them - and no plan can succeed without it.\nThe fifth verse (19) carries an address to the defeated disbelievers from the tribe of Quraysh and refers to an event which came to pass when the Quraysh army was about to depart Makkah on their mission to confront Muslims.\nAccording to the report of that event, when the army of Qurayshi disbelievers was ready to march against Muslims, the commander of the army, Abu Jahl and other chiefs had made earnest prayers holding the covering drapes of the Baytullah in their hands before leaving Makkah. Strange as it would seem, they did not specifically pray for their own victory. Rather, the prayer they made was in general terms and its words were:\n\"0 Allah, let victory come to the superior-most out of the two armies, and to the better-guided out of the two groups, and to the nobler out of the two parties, and to the religion and faith which is more sublime out of the two.\" (Mazhari)",
