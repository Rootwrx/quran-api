  "text": "Production and Supply of Military Hardware for Jihad is a Religious Obligation\nGiven in the second verse (60), there are injunctions relating to preparations for the defence of Islam against disbelievers. It was said: وَأَعِدُّوا لَهُم مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم (And make ready against them whatever you can - 60). Here, by placing the restriction of: مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم (whatever you can) with the need to produce and supply war materials, the hint given is that it is not necessary for your success that you go about acquiring the same quantity and quality of military equipment as is available to your adversary. Instead of that, it is quite sufficient that you put together whatever supplies you can possibly acquire. If so, the help and support of Allah Ta ala shall be with you.\nAfter that, some details about the direction of these preparations were stated tersely. It was said: مِّن قُوَّةٍ (min quwwah : of power). It means: Collect and keep ready the power to fight. Included here is everything in the form of military equipment, weapons, means of transportation and other relevant support - and also learning to stay physically fit and training in fighting skills and strategy. The Qur'an, however, does not mention the weapons commonly used during those days at this place. Instead, by using the general word, قُوَّةٍ 'quwwah' or power, it has pointed out in the direction that this power could be different in terms of every age, country or area. The weapons of those days were arrows, swords and spears. Then came the age of guns and cannons and now is the time of bombs and rockets (and what not). The word: قُوَّةٍ 'Quwwah' or power used here covers everything. Therefore, Muslims of today should acquire nuclear capability as far as they can - and tanks and fighter planes and submarines - because all these are included within the sense of this very قُوَّةٍ 'Quwwah' or power. It should also be borne in mind that should we need to learn any art or science to achieve this end and if such effort be made with the intention that it will be employed to defend Islam and Muslims and to meet any aggressive challenges from the disbelievers - then, that too will fall under the procedure of Jihad and will carry reward.\nAfter having mentioned the word: قُوَّةٍ 'Quwwah' (power) in a general sense, also mentioned there was a particular form of power in clear terms by saying: مِن رِبَاطِ الْخَيْلِ (and of the trained horses). The word: رِّ‌بَاطِ (Ribat) is used in its sense as a verbal noun as well as in the sense of: مَربُوط (marbut). Taken in the first sense, it would mean to tie horses and in the second, tied horses. The outcome of both is the same, that is, to breed, break and train horses and hold them tied in readiness with the intention of using them in Jihad, or to assemble together a collection of such trained horses. Out of the supplies needed in a war, horses were mentioned particularly for the reason that those were times when the most effective mode of winning a war against countries and peoples of that period was no other but horses. Even today, there are inaccessible areas which cannot be overtaken without horses. Therefore, the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tsaid: Allah Ta` ala has placed barakah on the forehead of horses.\nThere are other sound Ahadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ has declared the efforts to procure and assemble war materials and the learning of the ability to use them efficiently to be a great act of ` Ibadah deserving supreme rewards from Allah. Similarly, equally great returns have been promised for making and shooting arrows.\nAnd since the real purpose of Jihad is to protect and defend Islam and Muslims - and defence as conceived in every period of time and by every set of people remains different - therefore, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: جَاھِدُوا المُشرِکینَ بِاَموَالِکُم وَ اَنفُسِکُم وَ اَلسِنَتِکُم (Carry out Jihad against the Mushrikin with your belongings, and your own selves and your eloquence (of speech or writing). (Hadith reported by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i and Ad-Darimi from Sayyidna Anas ؓ .\nThis Hadith tells us that the way Jihad - defensive or initiated - is waged with weapons, it is also carried out at times with the power of speech, and the Jihad carried out with the power of pen or writing is governed by the same injunction which governs speech. When Islam and Qur'an are defended through the medium of speech or writing against attacks from the forces of disbelief and atheism, or from agents of disinformation, distortion and interpolation, that too is included in Jihad as based on this clear and definitive textual authority of the Qur'an (Nass).\nAfter having given the command to make war materials ready for use, also described there was the wisdom of assembling these materials together - and its real purpose - in the following words: تُرْ‌هِبُونَ بِهِ عَدُوَّ اللَّـهِ وَعَدُوَّكُمْ \" (whereby you frighten the enemy of Allah and your own enemy - 60). It means that the real purpose of acquiring and storing military hardware, whether for initiated action or defence, is not to indulge in an exercise of killing and being killed. The purpose, in fact, is to bring down the force of Kufr and Shirk and fill the hearts of their protagonists with awe so that they stay suppressed. On occasions, that can be done by the power of the spoken or the written word only. Then, there are other occasions when fighting and killing become necessary. So, defence is obligatory (fard) as dictated by the prevailing condition.\nThen it was said that Muslims do know some of those people who are to be impressed with preparations and readiness for combat - and these are people engaged in an ongoing confrontation with Muslims, that is, the disbelievers of Makkah and the Jews of Madinah. Then, there were other peoples too, those whom the Muslims did not know yet. The reference here is to the disbelievers and polytheists of the whole world who had not come up against Muslims, yet in future, they too were to clash against them. This verse of the Holy Qur'an has told Muslims clearly that, in case they do make full preparations to fight against their present adversary, it will not only cow them down but will also cast its shadows over disbelievers living in distant lands, as it did happen in the case of Cyrus and Ceaser and others of those days. They all were deterred and suppressed during the age of the rightly-guided Khulafa' of Islam.\nIt goes without saying that the process of putting war materials together and fighting a war has to be backed financially and when it comes to actual production or procurement of military support, that too can be made available through investment of money. Therefore, at the end of the verse, the great merit and reward of spending wealth in the way of Allah has been described by saying that 'the return for whatever you spend in the way of Allah shall be given to you in full.' There are times when this return is received in the form of war spoils right here in this mortal world as well, otherwise, the return to be received in the Hereafter stands already determined - and, as obvious, that is more praiseworthy.",
