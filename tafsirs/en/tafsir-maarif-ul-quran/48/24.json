  "text": "Commentary\nبِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ (...in the valley of Makkah...) The Arabic word used here is batn which means 'belly' and in relation to a city, it refers to its center.\nHowever, in the present context it is used for Hudaibiyah, because of its close proximity to Makkah. This supports the Hanafi view that some parts of Hudaibiyah are included in the حِرِم Haram. The relevant details may be found in our commentary on the verse 2:196.",
