In the preceding verses, promises were made about conquests and spoils of war; reference was made to the special merits of the participants of Hudaibiyah and general merits of all the noble Companion ؓ ; and glad tidings were given to them. Now at the conclusion of the Surah all these themes are summarized and emphasized. Because these blessings were showered and the glad tidings were given as a result of accepting and obeying the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، the verse lays further stress on strengthening the acceptance and obedience of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . It also denounces those who reject the messenger-ship of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and allays suspicions of those Muslims who were dissatisfied with the terms and provisions of the Treaty of Hudaibiyah. The verse in addition confirms the messenger-ship of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and, giving glad tidings, makes a very bold prophecy to the effect that not only would Islam prevail in Arabia but would also eventually triumph over all other religions.",
