The construction kalimat-at-taqwa connotes the word of the pious persons, that is, the Kalimah of Tauhid and Risalah whereby a person declares his faith in Allah's Oneness and in the Messenger-ship of Sayyidna Muhammad ﷺ . It is named here as 'word of piety' because this word is the foundation of piety, righteousness and right conduct. The noble Companions ؓ here are said to have better right to it and more worthy of it, and thus Allah exposed and unmasked those people who accused them of infidelity and hypocrisy. Allah asserts that the noble Companions ؓ are more worthy of the word of Islam and better entitled to it, and thus made them adhere to it firmly, whereas the wretched evil-minded people refuse to acknowledge their value and entitlement.",
