(23:97, 98)\nThe word هَمَز (the infinitive of هَمَزَاتِ Hamazat translated above as 'strokes' ) means \"to push, to press\" and sometimes is also used to mean \"to make a call from behind\". This is a very comprehensive prayer often invoked for protection from the guile and mischief of Shaitan and the Holy Prophet ﷺ has urged upon the Muslims to recite it frequently in order to avoid sudden bursts of rage which are brought about by the promptings of and which cause people to lose self-control. This prayer is also very effective in repelling other assaults of Shaitans and Jinns. Sayyidna Khalid ؓ suffered from insomnia and the Holy Prophet ﷺ suggested that he should recite the following prayer before going to bed :\nاَعُوذ بِکَلِمَاتِ اللہِ التَّامَّۃِ مِن غضَبِ اللہِ وَعِقَابِہٖ وَمِن شَرِّ عِبَادِہٖ وَمِن ھَمَزٰتِ الشَّیٰطِینِ وَاَن یَّحضُرُونِ\nI seek refuge with Allah's Perfect Words from Allah's wrath and His punishment, and from the evils of His slaves, and from the strokes of the Shaitans and from that they come to me.\nSayyidna Khalid ؓ did as advised and was soon cured of insomnia.",
