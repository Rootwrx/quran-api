  "text": "وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعَ طَرَ‌ائِقَ\nAnd We created upon you seven paths (heavens) - 23:17\nطَرَ‌ائِقَ is the plural of طَرِیقَۃ which may also be used as a synonym for طَبقَہ (tier) in which case the meaning would be that Allah created seven skies overhead row upon row in tiers. The other and more common meaning of the word طَرِیقَۃ is \"road\" or \"passage\" in which case the verse would mean that these skies provide a path for the angels who bring commands from Allah to the earth.\nوَمَا كُنَّا عَنِ الْخَلْقِ غَافِلِينَ (And We were never neglectful of the creation - 23:17). The verse means that Allah did not just abandon man after creating him, but was ever mindful of his needs and provided the means for his sustenance and growth. To this end He first created the skies and from the skies He sent forth rains upon the earth which then produced food for men's nourishment.\nThe Divine system of providing water to meet human needs\nوَمَا كُنَّا عَنِ الْخَلْقِ غَافِلِينَ وَمَا كُنَّا عَنِ الْخَلْقِ غَافِلِينَ\nAnd We sent down water from the sky in due measure, then We lodged it in the earth, and of course, We are able to take it away. - 23:18",
