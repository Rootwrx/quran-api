  "text": "وَفَارَ‌ التَّنُّورُ‌ (And the oven gushes forth - 23:27). The word تَّنُّور‌ means oven which is used for making flat, round bread, and is also used in the sense of the whole earth. According to some people تَّنُّور‌ is a specific oven in the Kufah mosque, while others believe that it was somewhere in Syria. Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) was informed by Allah that when water began boiling forth from the تَّنُّور‌ (oven) that would be the sign of the coming of the Deluge (Mazhari). The story of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) ، the Deluge and his Ark has been reported in some earlier Surahs (See Volume 4, p. 626 to 643).",
