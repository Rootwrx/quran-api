Sinai is the name of the area where the Tur Mountain is located. Olive oil can be used to massage the body, in lamps to provide light and in food as a curry or dressing. This has been expressed in the verse in the words تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلْآكِلِينَ (which grows having oil and a dressing for those who eat - 23:20).",
