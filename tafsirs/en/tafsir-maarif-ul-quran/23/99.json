  "text": "رَ‌بِّ ارْ‌جِعُونِ (My Lord, send me back - 23:99) When death approaches an infidel and he senses the punishment that awaits him on the Day of Judgment, he wishes for a return to this world, so that by performing good deeds he may escape the punishment which he has richly deserved.\nIbn Jarir has related a story on the authority of Ibn Juraij that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said, \"At the time of death when a good Muslim perceives the angels of mercy and all the luxuries of Paradise spread out before him, and the angels ask whether he wishes to be sent back to the world, his reply invariably is in the negative. He refuses to return to a place which is full of woes and suffering and misery, and only desires to be taken to Allah's presence. But when the same question is put to an infidel, his answer is رَ‌بِّ ارْ‌جِعُونِ i.e. he wishes to be sent back to the world.\"",
