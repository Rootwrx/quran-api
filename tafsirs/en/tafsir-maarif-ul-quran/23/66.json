  "text": "مُتْرَ‌فِيهِم (their affluent ones - 23:64). The word مُتْرَ‌فِ is derived from تْرَ‌فِ meaning comfort and prosperity. This verse mentions the Divine punishment which will descend upon the unbelievers whether rich or poor. The rich people have been specially mentioned here because they are the ones who make adequate arrangements to protect themselves against disasters and misfortunes. But when retribution comes from Allah, they find themselves totally helpless. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ the punishment which is mentioned in this verse is an allusion to the crushing defeat which the infidels of Makkah suffered at the hands of the Muslims in the Battle of Badr. Some others say that the reference is to the severe famine which afflicted the people of Makkah as a result of the curse laid on them by the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، when they were forced to eat dead animals and cats and dogs.\nAlthough the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions, when faced ill-treatment from the infidels, used to remain patient and never complained yet when their suffering and torment became unbearable, the Holy Prophet ﷺ invoked divine punishment for the infidels in the following words:\nاللَّھُمَّ اشدد وطأتک علٰی مضر و اجعلھا علیھم سنین کسنی یوسف (رواہ البخاری مسلم) (قرطبی و مظھری)\n(0 Lord! Let thy punishment descend hard on the tribe of Mudar and make their land barren like the land of Yusuf.",
