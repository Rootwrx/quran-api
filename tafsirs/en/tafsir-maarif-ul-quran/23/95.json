(23:95)\nSome commentators say that even though Allah has promised, on account of His regard for the Holy Prophet ﷺ that He will not punish the entire community while he (Holy Prophet ﷺ) lives among them وَمَا كَانَ اللَّـهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ (And Allah is not to send punishment upon them while you are in their midst-- 8:33) yet the punishment of some selected persons in special circumstance does not negate the promise. The punishment of the infidels of Makkah through famine and through their defeat at the hands of the Muslims at the Battle of Badr had taken place in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، which is emphasized in this verse that \"We have the power to show you what We threatened them with\".",
