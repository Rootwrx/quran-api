Sayyidna Umamah ؓ narrates that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said anyone who recites Surah Dukhan on Friday, in the night or in the day, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise. (Qurtubi on the authority of Thalabi).\nIn the present set of verses, the greatness of Qur'an and some of its special features are described. وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ \"By the manifest Book\". This verse refers to the Holy 'Qur'an'. In the verse Allah swears an oath by the magnificent Qur'an to state that it was revealed in a blessed and auspicious Night, the purpose of which is to awaken the unmindful human beings from their deep slumber. A similar oath was taken, in exactly the same words, at the commencement of Surah Az-Zukhruf (Chapter 43). The oath-phrase has been fully discussed there.",
