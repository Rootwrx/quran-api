The current set of verses describes the eternal blessings of Paradise. Almost all sorts of blessings have been referred to in these verses, because the following are generally the human needs:\n(1)\tfine dwelling;\n(2)\tfine clothing;\n(3)\tthe best life-partner;\n(4)\tthe best food;\n(5)\tthe satisfaction that these blessings will remain available; and\n(6)\tassurance of total security from grief and affliction. In these verses all the six kinds of blessings for the inmates of Paradise have been mentioned.\nLet us carefully analyze the six verses in this set. The dwelling of the inmates is described as 'amin \"free from fear\". The best human dwelling, according to verse (51), is the one that is secure from all kinds of dangers.",
