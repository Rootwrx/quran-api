  "text": "Commentary\nPunishment and Reward of the Hereafter\nIn these verses, according to the style of the Qur'an, Allah describes Hell and the way the unbelievers will be punished, and Paradise and the way the believers will be rewarded.\nPunishment of the Dwellers of Hell\n\"Indeed the tree of zaqqum... (44:43) \". Some necessary information regarding the reality of zaqqum has been given in Surah As-Saffat. Please see under (37:64-65). Here the Qur'an apparently indicates that the infidels will be given zaqqum to eat even before they enter Hell, because in this verse the Qur'an says that after having fed them with zaqqum they will be seized by the keepers of Hell and dragged into the middle of the blazing fire of Hell. According to some commentators, this is the meaning of (56:56) Surah –Al-Waqi'ah هَـٰذَا نُزُلُهُمْ يَوْمَ الدِّينِ (This will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital\". They argue that the word nuzul (entertainment) originally refers to the starter food and provision served to guests to make them feel welcome before the main course of entertainment is served. The main course of food and provision served later on is called diyafah or ma'dubah. The wordings of the Qur'an do carry the possibility that the feeding of zaqqum could be after the entry into Hell. In this case the word nuzul would refer, by extension, to the main course of meals and provisions served. The verse under comment which speaks about 'dragging the dweller of Hell towards the middle of the blazing fire' means, he would already be in Hell but after feeding him zaqqum he will be dragged towards the middle of the fire to expose him to a greater degree of disgrace and torture. Allah knows best! (Condensed from Bayan-ul-Qur'an).",
