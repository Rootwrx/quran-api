  "text": "How to conduct oneself when the Qur'an is being recited\nفَاسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَىٰ (So listen to what is revealed - 20:13). Sayyidna Wahb Ibn Munabbih has said that the correct behavior while listening to the recitation of the Qur'an is, that one sits still, refrains from any unnecessary movement in a way that no organ of his body is involved in any other work, keeps eyes down - concentrates the mind towards understanding its meaning. The person who listens to the Holy Qur'an in this respectful manner is rewarded by Allah Ta` ala with a better understanding of His word.",
