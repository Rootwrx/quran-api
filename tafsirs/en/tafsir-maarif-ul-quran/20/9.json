  "text": "Commentary\nوَهَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ (And has there come to you the story of Musa? - 20:9) In the earlier verses, reference was made to the greatness of the Qur’ an and also to the reverence due to the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Thereafter, the story of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) has been related so that the Holy Prophet ﷺ should become fully aware of the trials and tribulations which afflict the prophets in the discharge of their missions, and which were rendered with courage and fortitude by the earlier prophets. This was to prepare the Holy Prophet ﷺ for the great mission which was entrusted to him. There is another verse which conveys the same sense:\nوَكُلًّا نَّقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنبَاءِ الرُّ‌سُلِ مَا نُثَبِّتُ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ\n\"And We narrate to you everything from the events of the messengers with which We strengthen your heart.\" (11:120)\nIt means that these stories are narrated to prepare you (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) and make you strong to undertake the responsibilities of the mission.\nThe story of Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) which is related here begins like this. At Madyan he stayed with Sayyidna Shu` aib (علیہ السلام) with the understanding that he would serve the latter for a period of eight or ten years. According to Tafsir Al-Bahr ul-Muhit, after the expiry of this period he sought the permission of Sayyidna Shu` aib (علیہ السلام) to proceed to Egypt to see his mother and sister. He had fled earlier from Egypt fearing capture or death by the soldiers of the Pharaoh but this danger had now passed through the lapse of so many years. Sayyidna Shu'aib (علیہ السلام) willingly gave the permission and sent him away, with his wife (who was the latter's daughter). He also gave him some money and a few articles which they might use during their journey. Since he was apprehensive of the hostility of some of the rulers in Syria, he adopted a less frequented route. It was winter season and his pregnant wife was very close to confinement. The route which he had taken was unfamiliar to him, and he lost his bearings. He came out to the west, i.e. the right side of the mount of Tur.\nIt was a dark and cold night and to add to the misery, his wife began to experience birth pangs. He tried to strike fire with flint but did not succeed. In this state of utter confusion he saw light on the Tur mountain which, in fact, was the Nur (the light symbolizing the truth). So he said to his family, \"I have noticed fire. I am going there to bring for you a live coal and I may also find someone who could tell me the way to Egypt.\" The presence of his wife on the journey is well established. According to some traditions there was a servant with him who is also addressed. Others say that there were some other companions also who were separated when they lost their way.
