  "text": "يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ‌ وَأَخْفَى (Knows the secret and what is even more hidden - 20:7). سِرّ (Sirr: Secret) means something which a man hides in his heart and which is not known to anyone else and ) اخفٰی (what is more hidden) means a thought which has not even formed in his mind and will take shape later on. Allah is fully aware of what ideas a man conceals in his heart at a particular moment and what thoughts he will entertain in the future, while the person concerned himself does not know what thoughts will come to his mind in the days to come.",
