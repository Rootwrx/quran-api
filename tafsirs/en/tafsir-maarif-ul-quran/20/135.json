It means that though everybody is free to claim merit for his own ways and his own actions, these claims are of no value, because the correct way is that only which finds favour with Allah, and on the Day of Resurrection everybody will be made aware as to who followed the path of error and who took the road to salvation.\nاللہُمَّ اھدنا لما اختلف فیہ الی الحَقَ باذنکَ ولاحَول ولا قُوَأۃَ الَّابِک ولا ملجأ مِنکَ الَّا اِلَیک\nAlhamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Ta-Ha\nEnds here.",
