  "text": "Commentary\nطه (Ta-Ha) Many Commentators have assigned different meanings to this word. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ thinks it means یا رجُل (0 man! ) while according to Ibn ` Umar ؓ it means یا حبیبی (0 my Dear! ). It is also suggested that طه and یٰسین are the names of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . However the most obvious explanation is the one given by Sayyidna Abu Bakr ؓ and the majority of scholars, namely that like many other isolated letters appearing at the beginning of several chapters of the Qur’ an (such as الٓمٓ), this word is also among the مُتَشابِھَات mysteries whose meaning is known only to Allah Ta’ ala.",
