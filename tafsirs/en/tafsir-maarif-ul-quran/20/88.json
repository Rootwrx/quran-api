But the majority of commentators believe that the calf in fact possessed signs of life.\nفَقَالُوا هَـٰذَا إِلَـٰهُكُمْ وَإِلَـٰهُ مُوسَىٰ فَنَسِيَ (Then they said, \"This is your god and the god of Musa, and he erred.\" - 20:88) Having carved a calf which could also produce a sound, Samiri and his friends said to the Bani Isra'il\", \"Here is your god and the god of Musa. It seems Musa (علیہ السلام) has forgotten, that is why he has gone elsewhere in search of god\".",
