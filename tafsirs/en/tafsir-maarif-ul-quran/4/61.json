  "text": "The second verse (61) tells us that turning away from the decision of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، given under the dictates of the Shari’ ah in matters relating to mutual quarrels and disputes, can never be the response of a Muslim. One who does it has to be a munafiq (hypocrite). Thus, when the disbelief of this hypocrite was practically exposed through his dissatisfaction with the decision of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، his being killed by Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ became all the more justified, because he no more remained a munafiq (hypocrite) and, in fact, became an open Kafir (or apostate). Therefore, it was said; And when it is said to them, \"Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,\" you will see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion.'",
