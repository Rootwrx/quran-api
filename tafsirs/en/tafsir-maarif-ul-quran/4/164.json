  "text": "In verse 164 which opens with the words: وَرُ‌سُلًا قَدْ قَصَصْنَاهُمْ عَلَيْكَ And, (We have sent down) some Messengers We have already told you about ...', after a brief mention of prophets who appeared after Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) ، a special citation has been made of the greatest prophets from among them. The purpose is to tell us that they are all prophets and Wahy comes to prophets via different modes. It could be an angel with a message. It could also be a written Book. Sometimes Almighty Allah talks directly to His Messenger. In short, when Wahy comes, no matter in what mode or manner it does, acting in accordance with it becomes obligatory. Therefore, the saying of Jews that they would believe only if there comes to them a written Book like the Torah, otherwise they would not, is to say the least, being short on sense and tall on disbelief.\nAs reported by Sayyidna Abu Dharr al-Ghifari ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Almighty Allah has sent one hundred and twenty four thousand prophets out of which three hundred and thirteen were Shari` ah-bearing Messengers of Allah.
