  "text": "Sequence\nIn previous verses, the objective was to correct the malpractices of the days of ignorance committed about orphans and inheritances. The people of jahiliyyah also used to subject women to cruel treatment. They had certain other evil customs also, such as marrying prohibited women.\nThe present verses are meant to correct such customs, however, it has been permitted that if a woman commits a proven guilt, she can be punished. This subject of correcting the evil customs will continue through the next two or three sections.\nCommentary\nThese verses prescribe punishments for men and women who commit zina, (adultery or fornication). If this comes from women, the first verse requires the presence of four male witnesses to prove it. It means that the executive authority before which the case goes should call for four qualified witnesses to prove zinc. Then, it is necessary that all the witnesses are male. The testimony of women in this connection is not valid.\nSince the guilt of zina is of extremely grave nature which not only violates honour and modesty, but also brings bad name to the family, Islam has taken very strict attitude while setting the standard of evidence to prove this guilt. Firstly, there came the condition that witnesses have to be men; the evidence of women was not considered valid. Secondly, the number of the required witnesses is raised to four. As obvious, this condition is very hard to meet. It is something which can very seldom take place. This strict approach was taken so that the husband of the woman, his mother or (another) wife or sister do not level undue accusations against her out of personal spite. It was also to check that other ill-wishing people do not get any chance to release their personal hostility by accusing her falsely. Testimony to zina by less than four individuals renders their evidence invalid in which case the complainant and the witnesses may all be charged as liars and the Hadd of Qadhf (punishment for false accusation) becomes operative against them for having falsely accused a Muslim.\nIt has been very clearly said in Surah An-Nur:\nلَّوْلَا جَاءُوا عَلَيْهِ بِأَرْ‌بَعَةِ شُهَدَاءَ ۚ فَإِذْ لَمْ يَأْتُوا بِالشُّهَدَاءِ فَأُولَـٰئِكَ عِندَ اللَّـهِ هُمُ الْكَاذِبُونَ ﴿13﴾\nwhich means that those who cannot produce four witnesses are liars.\nSome revered elders, describing the wisdom behind the need to have four witnesses, have said that since this case involves two ; individuals, man and woman, this one single case comes, so to speak, under the purview of one rule for two cases. Since each case requires two witnesses, so four witnesses will be necessary in this case.\nTowards the end of the verse, it is said that should they both repent and correct themselves, then, leave them. It means that, in case they have repented after punishment, they should not be disgraced and punished any more. It does not mean that the act of repentance has absolved them of the punishment because this repentance has been mentioned after punishment as obvious from the ramification of the letter fa' (literally, \"then, turn away\", which has been left as under-stood in the present translation). However, in case repentance has not been made, reproach is in order even after punishment.\nNo definite حدّ Hadd (punishment) has been described in these two verses of the Holy Qur'an. What has been said here is limited to \"torture them\" and \"confine the fornicating women to their homes\". No particular method of such \"torture\" has been described either, and this has been left to the discretion of the authorities. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، says that torture here means that they should be verbally reproached and put to shame, as well as, given physical punishment such as hitting with hands and shoes ... This statement reported from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ appears to be illustrative. The fact of the matter is that this whole thing has been left to the discretion of the authorities.\nIn the order of revelation, the injunction 'to torture' the adulterers came first, and it was later that the women guilty of adultery were ordered to be 'confined to their homes'. While giving this command, the Holy Qur'an has mentioned two limits for the period of their confinement. The words used are: \"Confine those women to their homes until death overcomes them or Allah prescribes a way for them\". It means that such women shall be confined to their homes till their death, however, if Allah prescribes some other punishment for them while they are still alive, then that punishment will replace the punishment of confinement. That new (expected) punishment has been referred to in this verse as 'a way' prescribed by Allah. Later this 'way' as promised in this verse was prescribed and was revealed. Interpreting the word 'way' used in this verse, Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ says, یعنی الرجم للثیب و الجلد للبکر (that is, stoning to death, for the married and lashing for the unmarried.) (al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Tafsir, v.2, p. 657)\nThis \"way\" stands proved through clear statements of the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself where the relevant injunctions for the married and the unmarried have been described separately. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had pronounced the Hadd punishment of zina in the case of Sayyidna Ma` iz ibn Malik ؓ and a woman from the tribe of Azd. Since both of them were married, they were stoned to death. In addition to that, a couple from among the Jews of Madinah was also stoned to death because of zina and this judgment against them was pronounced on the authority of an injunction of Torah.\nThe injunction relating to the unmarried offender is mentioned in Surah al-Nur of the Holy Qur'an itself:\nالزَّانِيَةُ وَالزَّانِي فَاجْلِدُوا كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا مِائَةَ جَلْدَةٍ\n(The fornicator, woman or man, administer each one of them - a hundred lashes.) - (24:2)\nA verse of the Holy Qur'an was also revealed earlier to cover the injunction of رجم rajm (stoning to death), but its recitation was later on abrogated. However, the injunction itself was retained as operative.\nSayyidna ` Umar ؓ عنہ\thas said:\nاِنَ اللہ بعث مُحَمَّداً بلحق و انزلَ علیہِ الکتاب فکان مإَّا انزل اللہ تعالیٰ آیۃَ الرِّجم رَجَمَ رسول اللہ ﷺ ورَجَمنا بعدہ والرَّج، ُ چی کتاب اللہِ حَقُّ علٰی من زَنٰی اذا احصن منِ الرِّجال ِ والنِّساءِ (بخاری و مسلم – مشکوٰۃ ص 309)\n(Surely, Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the truth and sent down to him the Book. Then, in what was revealed by Allah Almighty there was the verse of Rajm. The Holy Prophet ﷺ stoned and we stoned after him and the revealed injunction of Rajm stands proved against everyone who commits zina despite being married, whether man or woman.) (al-Bukhari, Muslim, as in Mishkat, p. 309)\nTo sum up, the injunction of 'torturing' and 'confining to homes' which appears in these verses was abrogated after the subsequent revelation of the legal Hadd punishment of zinc, that is, one hundred lashes or Rajm will be mandatory. More details in this connection will, God willing, appear in the commentary on Surah al-Nur.",
