  "text": "Then begins verse 37 with الَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ which describes the nature of the arrogant who are stingy in giving rights which it is obligatory to give, fail to understand their responsibilities and go on to the negative extreme of persuading others to take to this bad habit through their word and deed.\nThe verse has used the word, 'bukhl' (niggardliness) to describe this trait of character, a word which, in the generally approved sense, is applied for shortcoming in giving financial rights. But, looking at the background of the verse's revelation, it becomes obvious that the word, 'bukhl' has been used here in its general sense which includes close-fistedness in money and knowledge both.\nA narration from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ tells us that this verse was revealed about the Jews of Madinah. They were very arrogant, and extremely miserly. When it came to spending money, they were miserably miserly. They also concealed the knowledge they received through their Scriptures which carried the prophecies about the coming of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . These also included clear signs of his appearance. But, the Jews, despite being convinced of these prophecies, acted niggardly. They never acted to fulfill the dictates of this knowledge, neither did they pass on the message to others who could act in accordance with it.\nBased on this, it is then said that people who are miserly with wealth given by Allah - in matters of knowledge and faith - are ungrateful to Allah and fail to acknowledge His blessings. For them Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment which they cannot escape.\nAbout the merit of giving and the demerit of miserliness, the Holy Prophet\tLI\thas said:\nمَا مِن یوم یصبح العباد فیہ الا ملکان ینزلان فیقول احدھما اللھم اعط منفقاً خلفاً و یقول الاخر اللھم اعط ممسکا تلفاً (بخاری و مسلم)\n\"Every morning two angels descend. One of them says: 'O Allah, bless him who spends in the way of good'; and the other says: '0 Allah, send destruction on (the wealth of) the miser.\"' (al-Bukhari  Muslim, from Abu Hurairah ؓ .\nعَن اسماء ؓ قالت : قال رسول اللہ ﷺ انفقی ولا تحصی اللہ علیک ولا توعی فیوعی اللہ علیک وارضخی مَا ستطعت ط (بخاری و مسلم)\n'Give. Do not calculate, for Allah will then calculate in your case. And do not withhold, for Allah will then withhold in your case. And give whatever you can.\" (al-Bukhari  Muslim from Sayyidah Asma' ؓ\nSayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ عنہ\tnarrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nالخیُّ قریب من اللہ، قریب من الجنۃ، قریب من الناس، والبخیل بعید من اللہ ، بعید من الجنۃ ، بعید من الناس قریب من النارط والجاہل سخی احب الی اللہ من عابد بخیل۔ (ترمذی)\n\"The generous person is close to Allah, close to Paradise, close to people; while the miser is far from Allah, far from Paradise, far from people - close to the fire; and the generous ignoramus is dearer to Allah than a miserly devotee. (a person who has devoted himself for worship) \" (Tirmidhi)\nSayyidna Abu Said ؓ narrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nو عن ابی سعید قال : قالَ رسول اللہ ﷺ خصلتان لا تجتمعان فی مؤمن، البخل و سوء الخلق (مرمذی)\n\"Two traits cannot get combined in a true Muslim: miserliness and bad morals.\" (Tirmidhi)",
