  "text": "Commentary\nAdmonishing Jews for being unreasonably envious\nThe knowledge, the grace, the high rank and the grandeur of mission given by Allah Almighty to the Noble Prophet ﷺ made Jews all too jealous. Verses 53 and 54 strongly admonish this attitude of theirs, giving two reasons why their envy was unreasonable. The first reason appears in verse 53, while the second, in verse 54. But, the outcome of both is the same. The drift of the argument is: 'What is the basis of your envy? If this is because you think you are the real inheritors of the kingdom and what he has been blessed with is actually yours, obviously then, this is all wrong. As it is, right now you have no kingdom. Even if you came to have some of it, you are not the kind to give anything to anybody. If your envy is based on the realization that the kingdom, no doubt, did not pass from you onto him, still, the question remains, why did it have to go to him at all. What relevance does he have with having a kingdom? The answer given was: He too comes from the family of prophets who have ruled over kingdoms before him. So, the kingdom has really not come to a stranger. Your envy, therefore, is unreasonable.'\nThe definition and rules of envy\n` Allamah al-Nawawi, the Commentator of Muslim, defines Hasad as : اَلحَسَدُ تَمَیّ زَوَّالِ النِّعمَۃ (Muslim, v.2). It means that Hasad (envy) is a desire to see the other person's blessing somehow disappear, and this is harm (forbidden).\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ has said:\nلا تباڈضواولا تحاسدوا ولا تدابروا ، وکونوا عباد اللہ اخواناً ، ولا یحل لمسلم ان یھجر اخاہ فوق ثلاث\n\"Do not hate and do not envy and do not turn your backs on each other. Instead, become servants of Allah, as brothers. And it is not lawful for a Muslim that he abandons his brother for more than three days.\" (Muslim, v.2)\nIn another hadith, he has said:\nاِیاکم والحسد، فإن الحسد یأکل الحسنات کما تاکل النار الحطب\n\"Beware of envy, for envy eats up good deeds as the fire eats up wood.\" (Abu Dwud, cited by Mishkat)\nSayyidna Zubayr ؓ ، narrates that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nعن الزبیر ؓ قال : قال رسول اللہ ﷺ : دب الیکم داء الامم قبلکم، الحسد والبغضاء ھی لحالقۃ، لا إقول تحلق الشعر، ولکن تحلق الدین\n\"Stealthily creeping into you is the disease of earlier peoples - envy; and hatred, which is a shaver. I do not say that it shaves hair, but it does shave the religion off.\" (Ahmad and Tirmidhi, cited by Mishkat)\nEnvy, whether it be on account of someone's worldly, or spiritual excellence, is harem (forbidden) on both counts, as the words أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ (Is it that they have a share in the kingdom?) seem to point out towards worldly excellence, while the words الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ (54) (the Book and the wisdom) are indicative of spiritual excellence.",
