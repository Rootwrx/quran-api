  "text": "The fourth verse (63) comes up with the answer. It says that Allah is all-aware of the disbelief and hypocrisy rooted in their hearts. All their interpretations are false, and their oaths, an exercise in lying. So, the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، is being asked to ignore their excuses and reject their charge of excess against Sayyidna ` Umar , as the disbelief of this particular hypocrite had become manifest.\nAfter that, towards the end of this verse (63), the Holy Prophet 4 has been asked to give good counsel to the rest of the hypocrites as well, in a way that may touch their hearts, that is, tell them to fear what lies beyond the present life and invite them to follow the path of Islam sincerely, or remind them of their likely worldly punishment in the event they stuck to their hypocrisy which might be exposed some day, some time, and they might as well meet the same fate as did Bishr, the hypocrite.",
