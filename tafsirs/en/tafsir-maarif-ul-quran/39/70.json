  "text": "In verse 69, it was said: وَجِيءَ بِالنَّبِيِّينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ (and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought,) It means that, at the time of reckoning on the plains of Resurrection, present there will be all prophets as well as all other witnesses. The prophets themselves will also be among the witnesses as said in the Qur'an: جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ (We shall bring a witness from every community - An-Nisa', 4:41). And angels too will be among the witnesses, as in the Qur'an: مَّعَهَا سَائِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ (with each someone [ meaning an angel ] to drive and someone [ meaning an angel ] to bear witness - Qaf, 50:21) where the identity of the driver and the witness has been clearly established as being the angels (Tafsir Ad-Durr-ul-Manthur). And among the witnesses, there will be the followers of the prophet of Islam as in the Qur'an: لِّتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ (and [ so that ] you become witnesses to [ other ] people - Al-Hajj, 22:78). And, for that matter, even one's own body limbs will appear as witnesses as said in the Qur'an تُكَلِّمُنَا أَيْدِيهِمْ وَتَشْهَدُ أَرْ‌جُلُهُم (their hands will speak to Us and their feet will bear witness - Sin, 36:65).",
