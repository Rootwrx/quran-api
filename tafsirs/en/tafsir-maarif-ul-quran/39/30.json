  "text": "Commentary\nIn verse 30, it was said: إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ (Verily, you are to die and they are to die). The word: مَيِّتٌ (mayyit) with a doubling sound on the letter: اَلیاء (al-ya) denotes someone who will die in the future and مَیت (mait) with the letter al-ya' remaining quiescent, someone who has died. In this verse, the address is to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and it is being said to him that he too is to die and so are his friends and foes, who will also die. The objective behind the statement is to alert and persuade everyone to be concerned about the Hereafter and be ready to do everything necessary to achieve this goal. Then, as an inter-related side of the subject, the purpose is also to make it very clear that the Holy Prophet ﷺ too, despite being the most sublime among the creation and the foremost among prophets, is not exempted from death, so that people would not differ about this matter after his passing away from this mortal world (from al-Qurtubi).",
