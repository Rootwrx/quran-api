The second phrase أَحْسَنَ مَا أُنزِلَ (the best of what has been sent down) means the Qur'an, and the whole Qur'an is but ahsan, the best - and the Qur'an can be called: اَحسَںَ و اکمل (best) also in the sense that out of all scriptures - Torah, Injil, Zabur - revealed from Allah Ta’ ala, the Qur'an is the best and the most perfect.
