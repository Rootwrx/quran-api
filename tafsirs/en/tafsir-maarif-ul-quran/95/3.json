  "text": "Commentary\nوَالتِّينِ وَالزَّيْتُونِ (I swear by the Fig and the Olive...95:1). This verse takes an oath by four objects. Two of them are trees, the fig tree and the olive tree. [ The third object ] is Tur, the mount of Sinai, and the fourth object is the City of Makkah. The two trees have been specified because they possess abundant blessings and advantages in the same way as Tur and the City of Makkah possess abundant blessings. Some authorities say that the 'fig' and the 'olive' symbolise, in this context, the lands in which these trees predominate: that is, the countries bordering on the eastern part of the Mediterranean, especially Palestine and Syria. Most of the Prophets (علیہم السلام) lived and preached in these lands, including Holy Prophet Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) . The latter Prophet was made to migrate from here to Makkah. The oaths, in this way, comprehend all the holy places where Allah-inspired men were born and raised as Prophets t. Syria was the land and home of all the Prophets (علیہم السلام) . Mount Sinai stresses specifically the messenger-ship of Musa (علیہ السلام) where Allah spoke to him. 'Peaceful City' refers to Makkah, the birthplace and residence of the Final Messenger of Allah ﷺ .",
