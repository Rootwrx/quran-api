  "text": "لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلَا جَانٌّ (...whom neither a man will have touched before them, nor a Jinn....55:56). The word طْمِث tamth has different meanings. 'Menstrual discharge' is termed as tamth, and the menstruating woman as طْامِث 'tamith'. It also means 'sexual intercourse with a virgin'. This second sense is meant here in this verse.",
