The meaning is obvious: 'And observe the weight with equity'.\nوَلَا تُخْسِرُ‌وا الْمِيزَانَ (and do not make weighing deficient...55:9). The word خُسر khusr means 'to skimp or make deficient'. The opening part of verse [ 9] was the positive aspect of the injunction, and the concluding part is its negative aspect, in that it is unlawful to fall short of measure or weight. The two parts, positive and negative, put together the verse as a whole means 'Do not cheat in weights and measures, but rather observe justice and fairness'.",
