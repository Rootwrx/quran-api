The word جَوَارِی۔ jawari is the plural of جَارِیَہ - jariyah. One of its meanings is ship and that is the sense in which it is used in the current verse. The word مُنشَآتُ munsha'at is derived from نَشَأ nasha'a which means 'to rise up or high, be lofty'. Al-munsha'at thus refers to 'sails of the ships that are lofty'. The verse describes the wisdom of making the ship and its running on the surface of the water.",
