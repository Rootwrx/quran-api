  "text": "In verse 18, it was said: إِنَّا سَخَّرْ‌نَا الْجِبَالَ مَعَهُ يُسَبِّحْنَ بِالْعَشِيِّ وَالْإِشْرَ‌اقِ (We had subjugated the mountains to join him in making tasbih (i.e. pronouncing Allah's purity) at evening and sunrise). In this verse, mention has been made of mountains and birds joining Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) in the act of tasbih. Detailed explanation of this phenomenon has already appeared in the commentary on Surah Al-Anbiya' and Saba'. Here, it is worth noting that the tasbih of mountains and birds has been mentioned at this place in a manner that it was a particular blessing for Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) . The question is: How did this become a blessing for Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) and what particular benefit accrued from the tasbih of mountains and birds?\nOne answer to this is that it unravels a miracle at the hands of Sayyidna Dawud (علیہ السلام) - and it goes without saying that it is a great reward and blessing. In addition' to that, Maulana Thanavi (رح) has given a subtle explanation about it. He says that the tasbih performed by mountains and birds had created in him a special taste for the remembrance of Allah, something that generates initiative, courage and verve in acts of worship (` ibadah). Collective dhikr has another benefit - that the Barakah that issues forth from it reflects on each other from the participants. There is a particular method of dhikr and spiritual engagement (shughl) recognized among the noble Sufis in which the participant imagines that the whole universe is making dhikr. This method has an unusual efficacy of its own in correcting and purifying one's inner state as well as in his enthusiasm for \"ibadah. The basis of this method of dhikr is also deduced from this verse. (Masa'ilu-s- Suluk, Maulana Ashraf Thanavi ‘Ali (رح))\nThe Salah of ad-Duha (صلوٰۃ الضُحیٰ )\nAt the end of verse 18, it was said: بِالْعَشِيِّ وَالْإِشْرَ‌اقِ at evening and sunrise).\nThe word: عَشِيِّ (ashiyy) used here means the time following Zuhr up to the next morning while إِشْرَ‌اقِ (ishraq) means the time of the morning when sunshine has spread over the land. From this verse, Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has argued that the Salah of ad-duha stands proved. This Salah is also called the Salah of al-Awwabin. There are others who call it the Salah of al-Ishraq - though, later on, the name of the Salah of al-Awwabin became particularized with the six nafls made after Maghrib, while the Salah of al-Ishraq became well known for the two or four naffs offered close after sunrise.\nIn the Salah of ad-duha, one could choose to offer any (even) number of rakat from two to twelve. Hadith mentions many benefits it brings. According to a narration of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ appearing in Jami' of Tirmidhi, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"Anyone who were to become particular about two rakat of the Salah of ad-duha, has his sins forgiven - even if they be like the froth of the sea.\" In another narration from Sayyidna Anas ؓ ، he is reported to have said: \"Anyone who were to make twelve rakat of the Salah of ad-duha, for him or her Allah Ta’ ala will make a palace of gold in Jannah.\" (Qurtubi)\n` Ulama' have said that any (even) number of rakat from two to twelve that can be performed conveniently is correct. But, having some particular routine in the case of its number is better, and if this routine reaches the minimum of four rakat, it is much better - because, the normal routine of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was to do four rakat.",
