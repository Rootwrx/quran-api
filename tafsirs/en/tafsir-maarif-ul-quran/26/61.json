Indeed with me is my Lord. He will guide me -26:61-62.\nWhen the Pharaoh's army, which was in their pursuit, reached right behind them, all the people of Bani Isra'il called out ` We are caught'. And there was little doubt in their nabbing as the river was in front of them and the Pharaoh's enormous army behind them. Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) was fully aware of the situation, but his belief in the promise of Allah was unshaken like a rock. He, therefore, replied firmly that they will never be caught.",
