[ 12] And my heart gets straitened and my tongue is not fluent; so send for Harun. [ 13] And they have a charge of offence against me and I fear they will kill me;\" [ 14]\nThis verse indicates that Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) requested Allah to provide him with some resources to help them in carrying out his mission. It leads to the principle that so far as the objective is to obey Allah's command, praying for some helping resources cannot be regarded as seeking ruses and excuses to escape from the required act. The request of Sayyidna Musa\tعلیہ السلام was only to facilitate the implementation of Allah's command which is quite lawful.\nThe meaning of the word dalal used for Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام)\nقَالَ فَعَلْتُهَا إِذًا وَأَنَا مِنَ الضَّالِّينَ\nHe said, \"I did that at that time when I was one of the unaware people. (26:20)\nThis was the answer of Musa (علیہ السلام) to the objection of the Pharaoh that Musa (علیہ السلام) had killed an Egyptian. The gist of the answer is that it was not a deliberate murder; in fact the Egyptian was killed by mistake, because Musa (علیہ السلام) had only struck him with a blow which, by accident, caused his death. The word used, by the present verse, for this mistake is derived from ضَلَال (dalal) which is commonly used for intentional error. But the word is also used for 'unawareness' (which includes unintentional mistakes) It is this meaning that is intended here. This interpretation is supported by Qatdah and Ibn Zaid رحمۃ اللہ علیہم .\nIt is impossible for man to comprehend fully the entity and reality of the magnificence of Allah Ta’ ala\nقَالَ فِرْ‌عَوْنُ وَمَا رَ‌بُّ الْعَالَمِينَ\nPharaoh said, \"And what is the Lord of the worlds?\" (26:23)\nThis verse proves that it is not possible to know the exact reality of Allah's Being. Since the Pharaoh had asked a question regarding Allah Ta’ ala's intrinsic-self and reality, Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) instead of giving a direct answer to his query, described the attributes of Allah Ta’ ala in reply. He hinted in his reply that it is not possible for a man to perceive the essence and reality of Allah Ta’ ala. Hence, it was a futile question. (Ruh)",
