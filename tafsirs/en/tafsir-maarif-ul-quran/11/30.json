Turning such people out is not a right thing to do.'\nAnd: مُّلَاقُو رَ‌بِّهِمْ (They are surely to meet their Lord) could also mean: If, supposedly, I were to turn them out, when they go to their Lord on the day of Qiyamah and complain, what would I have to say?

To you being a man is counter to being a prophet, or you go to the other extreme and demand that poor people should be driven away from his company.",
