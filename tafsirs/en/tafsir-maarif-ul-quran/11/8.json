  "text": "Described in the seventh verse is the condition of those who denied that there was to be a Last Day and a Hereafter. Like chronic deniers of the truth, when they do not understand (or do not want to under-stand) something, they would dismiss it as nothing but magic.\nIn the eighth verse, an answer has been given to people who doubted the warnings of punishment given by prophets, peace be on them.
