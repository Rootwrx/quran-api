  "text": "As part of this event, the people of Sayyidna Salih (علیہ السلام) have been reported to have said to him: قَدْ كُنتَ فِينَا مَرْ‌جُوًّا قَبْلَ هَـٰذَا ( O Salih, we had hopes in you before this - 62). It means that, before he claimed to be a prophet and started telling them to shun idol-worship, they had great hopes in him. They thought he would rise to be a great reformer and leader of their people. The reason is that Allah Ta` a1a nurtures and grooms his prophets from their childhood in a way that they become models of good morals and habits. Whoever looks at them, loves and respects them. This is what happened in the case of the Last Prophet ﷺ Before he declared that he has been sent as a prophet, the whole Arabia called him al-amin (the trustworthy one) and took him to be true and righteous. It was only when he announced his prophet-hood and prohibited idol-worship that everyone turned hostile to him.",
