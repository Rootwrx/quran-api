Sayyidna Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas has narrated that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said.\nان خیر الذکر الخفی ، وخیر الرزق ما یکفی\n\"Surely the best way to make supplication to Allah is in\nundertone and the best sustenance is that which is sufficient for one's needs (i.e. neither more nor less than required) \" (Qurtubi)",
