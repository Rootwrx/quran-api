  "text": "This verse is an answer to ` As Ibn Wa’ ils boastful claim. How does he know that when he is brought back to life he will still have his wealth and children?\nأَطَّلَعَ الْغَيْبَ (Has he peeped in the unseen - 19:78) It is obvious that nothing of this kind has happened. Then why has he considered it as a surety?\nأَمِ اتَّخَذَ عِندَ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ عَهْدًا\n“ Or taken a covenant with The Rahman (All-Mercifull)”\nOr has he entered into a covenant with Allah Ta` ala and obtained a promise from Him for his wealth and his children?",
