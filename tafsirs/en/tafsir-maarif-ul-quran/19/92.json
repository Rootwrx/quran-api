  "text": "Commentary\nوَتَخِرُّ‌ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا\n\"And the mountains to fall down crumbling\" - 19:90.\nThese verses suggest that the earth, the mountains and everything that grows thereon possess a certain degree of knowledge and intelligence though in their case these perceptions are not of the same extent as that bestowed on human beings. This explains the fact that everything in the world glorifies Allah Ta’ ala as will be evident from the verse.\nوَإِن مِّن شَيْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ\n\"Arid there is not a single thing that does not extol His purity and praise.\" - 17:44.\nThese verses refer to this very perception of these things that to associate anything or being with Allah Ta` ala, specially to assert that He has children is a sin which makes the earth and the mountains quake with fear. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that except humans every created thing is terrified of any suggestion of association with Allah (Ruh, -ul-Ma` ani).",
