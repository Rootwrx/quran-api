When pressed to return the loan, ` As Ibn Wa’ il said that he would not make the payment until he (Sayyidna Khabab ؓ  dissociated himself from the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Sayyidna Khabab ؓ replied that he would never do that - not until ` As was dead and rose to life again. At this ` As Ibn Wa’ il said, \"What? Will I be brought to life again after I am dead? If so I will repay the loan only after I am brought back to life again because even then I will have my wealth and my children.\" (Qurtubi)",
