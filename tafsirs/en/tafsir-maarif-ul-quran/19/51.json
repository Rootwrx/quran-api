This special position is enjoyed by the prophets only as mentioned in the Qur’ an at another place.\nإِنَّا أَخْلَصْنَاهُم بِخَالِصَةٍ ذِكْرَ‌ى الدَّارِ‌\n\"We purified them with a quality most pure, the remembrance of the Abode.\" - 38:46.\nThose among the followers of prophets who attain perfection are also granted a place of distinction, which makes them immune to committing sins and evil deeds through Divine dispensation. They remain in Allah's protection all the time.",
