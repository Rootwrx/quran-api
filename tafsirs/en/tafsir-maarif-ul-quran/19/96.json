  "text": "سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنُ وُدًّا\n\"For them the Rahman (All-Merciful) will create love.\" - 19:96.\nIt means that for those who are steadfast in their faith in Him, Allah creates an environment of friendship and love for each other, which consequently promotes mutual amity and goodwill among the true Muslims. Furthermore, by their conduct and behavior they command the admiration and respect of all those with whom they come into contact. Bukhari, Tirmidhi and others have related on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said that when Allah Ta’ ala is pleased with someone He says to Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) ، \"I am pleased with so and so and I desire that you too should show favour to him.\" Jibra'l (علیہ السلام) makes an announcement to this effect in all the skies so that their residents begin to harbor a liking for that person. Then this love descends upon the earth and the people of the earth also begin to love him. The Holy Prophet ﷺ then quoted this verse. (Ruh ul-Ma’ ani).\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنُ وُدًّا\n\"Surely those who believe and do the righteous deeds, for them the Rahman (All-Merciful) will create love.\" - 19:96.\nHaram bin Hayyan has said that when a person devotes himself wholly towards Allah He fills the hearts of all believers with love for him. (Qurtubi)\nWhen Sayyidna Ibrahim Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) ، planned to go back to Syria, after leaving behind his wife Hajira and his baby son Sayyidna Isma` i1 (علیہ السلام) in the desert enclosed by the barren hills of Makkah in accordance with the command of Allah, he also prayed for both of them with the following words\nفَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ\n\"So make hearts of a number of people yearn toward them.\" - 14:37.\nThe prayer was granted so that even after the lapse of many millennia people all over the world entertain great love for Makkah and its inhabitants. They visit the place in large numbers, and not only incur heavy expenditure but also endure great hardships while making the journey.",
