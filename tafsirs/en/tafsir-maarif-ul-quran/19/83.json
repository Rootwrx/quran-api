  "text": "Commentary\nتَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزًّا\n\"Inciting them with all their incitements\" - 19:83.\nIn Arabic language the words حَضّ – فَزّ – اَزّ - ھَزّ are synonymous, differing only in shade or degree, and mean to urge, incite, instigate. The word اَزّ means to apply strong pressure, to persuade somebody to do something. The sense of this verse is that the Devils instigate the unbelievers to persist in their evil ways by presenting before their eyes the benefits and hiding from them the wickedness of their evil deeds.",
