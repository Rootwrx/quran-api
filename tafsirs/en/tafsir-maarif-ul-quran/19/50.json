This hope, in fact, was a prayer to Allah to protect him from the pain of loneliness after he left his house and family. The sentence reproduced above describes the manner in which his prayer was granted. When Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) left his home and family and their idols, Allah Ta` ala rewarded him with a son, Ishaq (علیہ السلام) to compensate him for his loss. It was further revealed to him that this son would have long life and also beget a son by the name of Ya` qub. Granting of a son is proof that he (Ibrahim) was married by then. In brief it means that he was granted a better family, which consisted of prophets and pious people after he had left his father's family.",
