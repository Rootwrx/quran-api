  "text": "Commentary\nSuperiority is not based upon wealth and property This is the second reply to the infidels of Makkah for their question why prophethood was not bestowed upon some very rich and wealthy person of Makkah or Ta'if? The gist of the answer is that some qualities and abilities are undoubtedly necessary for choosing someone as a prophet. But abundance of riches and wealth cannot be taken as the basis of this choice. Wealth and property are so worthless in Allah's view that if there was no apprehension of all the people becoming disbelievers, He will have showered gold and silver upon all the infidels. The Holy Prophet ﷺ has stated, in a hadith reported by Tirmidhi,\nلو کانت الدّنیا تعدل عند اللہ جناح بعوضۃِ ما سقی کافراً منھاشربۃ مَاء\n\"If the worth of the whole world, in Allah's sight, had been equal to that of one wing of a mosquito, Allah Ta` ala will not have given even one drop of water from this world to an infidel (kafir) \"\nThis tells us that neither abundance of wealth and property owned by someone can be a cause of his superiority, nor can one's poverty be taken as an indication of his being lower in rank. As for those excellent qualities which are necessary for prophethood, they are found in the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، to their perfection. Their objection is, therefore, false and baseless.\nThe statement in these verses that if gold and silver had been showered upon all the infidels, all the people will have become disbelievers is meant for most of the people. Even today, there are people who are certain that if they become disbelievers, they will get abundance of riches and wealth, but they do not lose their faith for the sake of wealth and property; such people will have remained steadfast to their belief and faith, perhaps even at that time, but the number of such people will have been very little indeed.",
