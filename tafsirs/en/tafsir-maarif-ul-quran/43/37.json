When such a man is resurrected in the Hereafter, his devil will also be with him, till they both are pushed in Hell. (Qurtubi).\nWe learn from this that the punishment one gets even in this world for turning away from Allah's remembrance is that he gets into bad company and 'shaitans' (devils), whether from humans or from jinns, keep diverting him from virtues to vices. He commits vices but thinks that he is doing very well. (Qurtubi). This devil who is assigned to such a person, as mentioned here, is in addition to the 'Shaitan' (Satan) who is attached to every believer and disbeliever, because that 'shaitan' (Shaitan) does leave the man alone at certain specific times, whereas this devil accompanies him all the time. (Bayan-ul-Qur an)",
