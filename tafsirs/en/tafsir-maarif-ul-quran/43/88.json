On the one hand, there are their severe crimes themselves, and on the other when the Messenger ﷺ ، who has been sent as a \"blessing for the world\" and \"interceder for the sinners\", himself complains against them and says that these people do not believe, despite repeated good counsels given to them, it indicates that they must have agonized the Holy Prophet ﷺ to an extreme extent, otherwise \"the blessing for the worlds\" would not have made such a plaint merely on an ordinary hurt.\nIt should be noted that the present verse has been construed in different ways. The above translation is based on the construction adopted by Maulana Ashraf ` Ali Thanawi (رح) . Various other constructions are given in Ruh-ul-Ma` ani.",
