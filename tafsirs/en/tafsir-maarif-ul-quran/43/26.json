  "text": "Commentary\nوَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمُ (And [ recall ] when Ibrahim said to his father and to his people,\t43:26) At the end of the previous verses, Allah Ta’ ala had stated that the 'mushrikin' (polytheists) of Arabia had no argument in favour of their 'shirk' (polytheism) except that they were carrying on the customs of their forefathers. Obviously, sticking to such customs against logical and historical arguments is far from truth and justice. Now the point made in the present verses is that, even if they are adamant on following their ancestors, why do they not follow Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) who is the most noble of their ancestors, and it is taken by themselves as a matter of pride to be among his offspring. He was not only a believer in 'tauhid' (Oneness of Allah) who emphatically directed all his children to remain adherent to this belief, but his life-long behavior also indicates that following forefathers against logical and historical proofs is not permissible. When he was ordained prophethood in the world, all his people were polytheists in pursuit of the customs of their forefathers, but he, instead of blindly following his forefathers, announced his dissociation from his people, according to the dictates of positive proofs; hence his declaration: إِنَّنِي بَرَ‌اءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ \"I disown that which you worship\" (43:26).\nWe find from this verse that if anyone lives among a group or people who are misguided or involved in bad deeds, and his silence about their attitude may be construed as being agreeable to them, then it is not enough for him to simply correct his own beliefs and deeds, rather he has to disown their beliefs and deeds as well. This is what Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) did - he not only made his belief and actions distinctly different in practice, but he also disowned their belief and deeds vocally.",
