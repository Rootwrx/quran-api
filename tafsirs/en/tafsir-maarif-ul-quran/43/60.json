Allah Ta ala states to controvert their argument that Sayyidna 'Isa's (علیہ السلام) birth was merely a demonstration of His power, and He has the power to do even more supernatural things like creating Sayyidna 'Adam (علیہ السلام) without father and mother. And if He wills, He may do as unprecedented things as causing angels to be born out of human beings.",
