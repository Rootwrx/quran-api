  "text": "6.\t'The word: غَوْلٌ (ghaul) in verse 47: لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ la fiha ghaulun) has been explained variously as 'headache' or 'abdominal pain' or 'smell or corruption' or 'muddling of reason'. The fact is that the word: غَوْلٌ (ghaul) is used to convey all these meanings, while Hafiz Ibn Jarir says that 'ghaul' appears here in the sense of bane, trouble or unwelcome consequences which makes it mean that the drink offered in Jannah will have no such evil consequences as are found in wines consumed in the mortal world - no hangovers of headache, stomach pain, bad breath or loss of reason. (Tafsir Ibn Jarir).",
