  "text": "7.\tIn verse 48, it was said: قَاصِرَ‌اتُ الطَّرْ‌فِ (restricting their gazes). This is an attribute of the hurs or houris of Jannah - wide eyes with lowered gaze. It means that except for the mate to whom Allah Ta’ ala gives them in marital bond, they will not raise their eyes to cast a look at any other male. 'Allamah Ibn-ul-Jauzi reports: These women will tell their spouses, 'By the honor of our Lord, I see no one better than you in this Jannah. Praised be Allah who made me your spouse and made you, mine.'\n` Allamah Ibn-ul-Jauzi has given yet another sense of 'those with lowered gaze' when he says that they will cause the gaze of their spouses remain lowered. In other words, they will be so beautiful and so faithful that their spouses would simply not have a wish to look at anyone else. (Tafsir Zad-ul-Masir , pages 57, 58, volume 8)",
