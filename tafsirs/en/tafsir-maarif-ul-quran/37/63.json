Here, according to some commentators, فِتْنَةً (fitnah) means punishment, that is, 'have turned this tree into a source of punishment.' But, most commentators say that it is more appropriate to translate 'fitnah' at this place as 'trial' or 'test'. The purpose here is to say that Allah wishes to test as to who believes in it, and who ridicules it. Consequently, what happened was that the disbelievers of Arabia failed this test.

So, come and eat this date and butter\" (ad-Durr-ul-Manthur, p. 277, v. 5). In fact, in the language of the Berbers, dates topped with butter or cream were known as zaqqum, therefore, Abu Jahl made use of this opportunity to ridicule the prophet of Islam. To the two things he said,",
