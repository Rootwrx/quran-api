It means that, in the sight of those who were born after Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) he was made so revered that they would continue praying for his peace and well-being right through the last day of the Qiyamah. As such, this is how it actually happened. All religions with attribution to Divine Scriptures subscribe to the mission of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) as a prophet and hold him in great reverence. In addition to Muslims, even Jews and Christians regard him as being their spiritual leader.",
