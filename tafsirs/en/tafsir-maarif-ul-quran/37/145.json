  "text": "In verse 145, it was said: فَنَبَذْنَاهُ بِالْعَرَ‌اءِ وَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ (Then We cast him ashore in the open while he was ill.) The word: اَلعراء (al-'ara) used in the text means an open land with no trees. Some narrations tell us that, at that time, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) had become very weak because of having remained confined within the belly of the fish and that he had no hair left on his body.",
