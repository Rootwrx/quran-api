  "text": "2.\tBy saying: فَوَاكِهُ (fawakih: fruits - 42) immediately after, the Qur'an has itself explained 'rizq' (provision) - that it will comprise fruits. The word: فَواکِہِ explained (fawakih) is the plural form of: فَاکِہا fakihah) and it denotes everything eaten for the taste and not to remove hunger. It is conveniently translated as fruit since it is eaten for the taste. Otherwise, the sense of fakihah is much wider than that of fruit. Imam Razi has culled the subtle point from this very word that the cuisine offered in Jannah will be for the taste of it, and not for removing hunger. The reason is that in Jannah there is nothing one would really need. Once there, one would need no food or energy-giving intake in order to sustain life or preserve health. Yes, there will be wish. The fulfillment of wish will bring the pleasure of satiation - and that would be the objective of all blessings of Paradise. (Tafsir Kabir, page 98. v.7)\n3.\tThen, by saying: وَهُم مُّكْرَ‌مُونَ (wa hum mukramun: and they will be honored), it was given to understand that this provision will be presented to the people of Jannah with full protocol of hospitality and honor, for an absence of it would render even the most delicious offering remain without relish. From here, we also learn that the right of a guest is not fulfilled simply by feeding him or her. In fact, the warmth of hospitality and the according of honor to a guest is also included under his or her rights.",
