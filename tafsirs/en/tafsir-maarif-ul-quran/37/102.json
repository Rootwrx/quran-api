  "text": "In verse 102, it was said: فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْيَ قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ إِنِّي أَرَ‌ىٰ فِي الْمَنَامِ أَنِّي أَذْبَحُكَ (Thereafter, when he reached an age in which he could work with him, he said, \"0 my little son, I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you, so consider, what do you think?\" ). From some narrations, it appears that this dream was shown to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) for three consecutive days (Qurtubi). Then, it already stands settled that the dream of blessed prophets is a revelation (wahy). Therefore, this dream meant that Allah Ta'ala was asking Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) to slaughter his firstborn son. For that matter, this command could have been revealed directly through an angel. But, the wisdom behind communicating it through a dream was to unravel the obedience of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) at its most sublime form. A command given through a dream could have a lot of room for interpretations and excuses by the human self. But, this was Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) . He did not take to the way of excuses. On the contrary, he simply bowed down (sans interpretations, sans hesitations) before the command of his Lord. (Tafsir Kabir)\nIn addition to that, the purpose of the great Creator here was neither to have Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) be slaughtered actually, nor was it to make it binding upon Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) that he slaughters him ultimately, instead, the purpose was to give the command that he should, on his part, do everything necessary to slaughter him and take all steps leading to his slaughter. Now, had this command been given to him verbally, it would disclose that the actual slaughter is not intended, and the element of test would have remained missing. Therefore, he was shown in a dream that he was slaughtering his son. From this Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) understood that what he was been commanded with is slaughter - and he was all set for it literally and comprehensively. Thus, the element of trial went the full circle, and the dream also came true. So, as said earlier, if this thing were to come through a verbal command, either there would have been no test, or the command would have to be abrogated afterwards.\nHow hard this test was! It is to allude to this aspect that Allah Ta’ ala has placed additional words in the statement here: فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْيَ. (Thereafter, when he reached an age in which he could work with him, - 102). In other words, it could be said that he was commanded to sacrifice his son he had so wistfully prayed for at a time when this son was old enough to walk by the side of his father, and the days when he could become the right arm of his father were not far. Commentators say that the age of Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) was thirteen years at that time. Some others say that he had crossed the age of puberty. (Tafsir Mazhari)\nIn the next sentence of verse 102, it was said: فَانظُرْ‌ مَاذَا تَرَ‌ىٰ (So consider, what do you think?) When Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) posed this question before Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) he really had no hesitation about carrying out the Divine command. In fact, he wanted to accomplish two things by doing so. Firstly, he wanted to test his son as to the extent to which he was ready to face this trial. Secondly, the noble prophets P--11 always have a way of their own - they are prepared to carry out Divine commands at all times. But, they always opt for methods that are suitable in such obedience, methods that are based on wisdom and all possible convenience. Had Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) started laying down his son in readiness for slaughter without having said anything to him or having heard anything from him in advance, it would have caused difficulties for both of them. Now, this thing that he said to him was in the spirit and manner of a tender consultation with his son. What he intended thereby was to let his son become aware of the command of Allah in advance, so that he is all prepared to endure the pain of being slaughtered well before the zero hour comes. Moreover, even if there emerged some hesitation in the heart of his son, there will still be the time to make him understand the situation. (Ruh- Ma’ ani and Bayan-ul-Qur’ an)\nBut, that son was no less than the son of the Friend of Allah, and the one who himself was bound to rise to the office and station of a prophet. In his answer, he said: قَالَ يَا أَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤْمَرُ‌ (0 my dear father, do what you have been ordered to do - 102). Not only that this statement provides an evidence of the unique passion of Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) to surrender his life in the way of Allah, it also shows the kind of intelligence and knowledge Allah Ta’ ala had blessed him with at such a tender age. It should be borne in mind that Sayyidna Ibrahim ill had not referred to any command from Allah before him, in fact, had mentioned a dream only. But, Sayyidna Ismail ill got the point. He understood that the dream of a prophet is a revelation (wahy) - and this dream too was, in reality, a form of Divine command as such. Hence, in his response, rather than mention the dream, he referred to the Divine order.\nThe proof of 'revelation not recited' (وَحِی غیر متلوّ ): wahy ghayr matluww)\nRight from here comes a clear refutation of those who deny the authority of Hadith and who do not accept the existence of any revelation that is not recited. They say that wahy or revelation is only that which has been revealed in the Scripture, the Book of Allah - other than that, no other form or kind of revelation exists. You have already noticed that the command to sacrifice his son was given to Sayyidna Ibrahim ill through a dream, and Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) had declared it to be the command of Allah in very clear words. Now, if 'the revelation not recited' (wahy ghayr matluww) is nothing, then where did this command come from and in which Scriptures was it revealed?\nAfter that, Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) also gave an assurance to his great father from his own side by saying: سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّـهُ مِنَ الصَّابِرِ‌ينَ (you will find me, insha۔ Allah, [ if Allah wills ] one of those who endure patiently.\"- 102). Just look at the extreme etiquette and modesty demonstrated by Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) in this brief statement of his. First of all, by saying \"insha'Allah\" (if Allah wills), he entrusted the matter with Allah Ta’ ala, and thus he eliminated any flair of having made a boastful claim through this promise. Then, he could have also said: 'You will, insha'Allah, find me enduring.' But, he did not say that. What he actually said was: \"You will find me one of those who endure patiently.\" ). Thereby he released the hint that all this endurance and patience is no feat of his all alone, rather, there have been many more of those who have been enduring and patient - insha'Allah, he too will hope to become one of them. Thus, through this statement, he eliminated the possibility of any traces of pride, arrogance, egotism and conceit, rather replaced it with the finest in manners and modesty. (Ruh ul-Ma’ ani) From here we learn the lesson that no matter how much confidence one has in one's own self, he should never make tall claims that smack of pride and bragging. If there is a compulsive need to have to say something of this nature, due attention should be paid to the choice of words that are being said. The best course is to shift the focus from one's own person and say what shows trust in Allah. In manners and attitudes too, one should try not to cut loose from the norms of modesty to the best of one's ability.",
