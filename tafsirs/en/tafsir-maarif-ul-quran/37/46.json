  "text": "5.\tThe word: لَذَّةٍ appearing in verse 46: لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّارِ‌بِينَ (ladhdhati lishsharibin: delicious for those who drink) is essentially a verbal noun which means 'to be tasteful'. Therefore, some commentators have said that, at this place, the adjunct (mudaf) stands elided. Initially, it was: ذات لَذَّةٍ (dhati ladhdhatin: having taste). But, there is no need for this labored approach. First of all, even if 'ladhdhah' is taken to mean nothing but a verbal noun is frequently used in the sense of ismul` fail. In that case, it would mean that it would be 'a taste personified' for those who drink. In addition to that, there is another adjectival form of: لَذَّةٍ : ladhdhatun besides لَذیذُ : ladhidhun - that is, لَذُّ : ladhdhun. It is possible that the word: لَذَّةٍ : ladhdhatun used here may be a feminine form of the same al ladhdhun (Tafsir Qurtubi). In this case, it would mean: 'delicious for those who drink.",
