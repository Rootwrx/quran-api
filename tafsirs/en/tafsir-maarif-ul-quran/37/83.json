  "text": "Commentary\nAfter having related the event concerning Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) the Qur'an mentions two events from the blessed life of Sayyidna Ibrahim ill. Both events highlight the great sacrifices Sayyidna Ibrahim offered for the sake of Allah alone. Out of these, the first event mentioned in the verses cited above relates to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) being thrown into the fire. Its details have already appeared in Surah Al-Anbiya' (21: 51-70). Yet, the way it has been described at this place, it needs some explanatory notes that appear below.\nThe word: شِيعَتِهِ (shi'ah) in verse 83: وَإِنَّ مِن شِيعَتِهِ لَإِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ (And certainly from his adherents was Ibrahim.) is used in the Arabic language for a group or party the individuals from which are similar to each other in basic concepts and methods - and here it is obvious that the pronoun in: شِيعَتِهِ (shi'atihi) is reverting to Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) . Therefore, it would mean that Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) adhered to the way of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) the prophet preceding him, and that there was a perfect agreement between them on the basic principles of faith - and it is also possible that the religious codes they had could also be the same, or similar. Let us bear in mind that, according to some historical narratives, there is a gap of two thousand six hundred and forty years between them, and there was no prophet except Sayyidna Hud and Sayyidna Salih (علیہ السلام) during this period.
