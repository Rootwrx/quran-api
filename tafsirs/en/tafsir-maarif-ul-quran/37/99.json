This is the event of the sacrifice of his first-born son in the way of Allah.\nExplanatory Notes on the verses\nThe first verse (99) opens with the words:... وَقَالَ إِنِّي ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَ‌بِّي سَيَهْدِينِ (And he said, \"I am going to my Lord...). Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) said this at a time when he was totally disappointed by his countrymen, for nobody except Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) ، his nephew, was willing to believe in him. The statement: دار الکفر (I am going to my Lord) means that he will leave the abode of disbelief and go to a place whereto Allah Ta’ ala has commanded him to go, a place where he will be able to worship his Lord in peace. So, he started on a journey accompanied by his blessed wife, Sayyidah Sarah ؓ and his nephew, Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) . After having passed through different areas of Iraq, he finally reached Syria. Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) had no children until then, therefore, he made the prayer mentioned in the next verse (100).",
