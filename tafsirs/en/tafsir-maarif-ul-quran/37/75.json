  "text": "Commentary\nIn the previous verses, it was said that Allah had sent messengers to warn the earlier communities as well, but most of the people did not listen to them, therefore, they met a very sad end. Now, from here details of that brief statement made earlier are being given. As a corollary, events relating to several noble prophets have been narrated. Mentioned first in these verses was Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) . The event relating to Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) has appeared in Surah Hud (11) with sufficient details. A few things connected with the explanation of these very verses particularly are being taken up here.\nIn verse 75, it was said: وَلَقَدْ نَادَانَا نُوحٌ (And Nuh did call Us). According to most commentators, it means either the prayer of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) mentioned in Surah Nuh: رَّ‌بِّ لَا تَذَرْ‌ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ مِنَ الْكَافِرِ‌ينَ دَيَّارً‌ا (My Lord, do not leave on earth even a single inhabitant (surviving) from the disbelievers - 71:26), or that which appears in Surah Al-Qamar: أَنِّي مَغْلُوبٌ فَانتَصِرْ‌ (I am overpowered, so defend me - 54:10). Sayyidna Nuh , 41 had made this prayer at a time when his people had crossed all limits in being wicked and unruly to him and had gone as far as conspiring to kill him.",
