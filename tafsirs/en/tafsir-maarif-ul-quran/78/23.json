  "text": "لَّابِثِينَ فِيهَا أَحْقَابًا (who will be abiding in it for ages....78:23). The word labithin is the plural of labith which means 'one who abides'. The word ahqab is the plural of hiqbah and means 'ages or a long time'. Scholars differ on the exact length or specific amount of time meant by this word. Ibn Jarir has recorded that Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ states that hiqbah is eighty years, and the year constitutes twelve months, and every month comprises thirty days, and each day is equivalent to one thousand years, thus one hiqbah totalling about twenty million and eighty-eight hundred thousand years . Sayyidna Abu Hurairah, ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar, Ibn ` Abbas ؓ and others say that one hiqbah is seventy years instead of eighty years. The rest of the calculation remains the same. [ Ibn Kathir ]. In Musnad of Bazzar, Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ traces the following Hadith to the Holy Prophet ﷺ :\nلا یخرج احدکم من النّار حتّٰی یمکث فیہ احقاباً ، والحقب بضع و ثمانون سنۃ، کل سنۃ ثلثمایٔۃ وستّون یوما ممّا یعدّون\n\"Those who will be put in Hell for punishment of their sins, they will not be able to come out until they tarry therein for a few Ahqib. One hiqbah will be a little over eighty years, and the year has three hundred and sixty days according to your reckoning [ in this life ].\"\nThis Tradition, though does not interpret this verse, it does explain the sense of the word ahqab. Some of the Companions mention that one day is equivalent to a thousand years. If they had heard this from the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، there is conflict in the narratives. In the face of such conflict, it is not possible to settle on one narration. However, there is a common denominator between the two conflicting narratives, that hiqbah means 'an extremely long period of time'. Therefore, Baidawi has interpreted the word as 'many long periods of time successively following the others.\nProblem of Eternity of Hell\nIf it be argued, as some do, that the inmates of Hell, after serving the long ages in Hell, will be released because no matter what the length of hiqbah, it is, nonetheless, finite and limited and will come to an end sometime or other. But looking at other clear verses of the Qur'an, the argument does not hold up. We come across express text like:\nخَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا\n'[ They, the disbelievers ] shall remain therein [ in the Fire ] for ever'.\nTherefore, there is the consensus of Ummah that neither Hell will perish, nor will the disbelievers be released at anytime.\nSuddi reports from Sayyidna Murrah Ibn ` Abdullah ؓ that if the inmates of Hell are informed that they will abide in Hell for the number of pebbles in the entire world, they will be happy even at this information, because these pebbles though will count into billions or zillions, still they are finite. If so, their punishment will, some time or the other, come to an end. If the same information is given to the inmates of Paradise that they will abide therein to the count of billions of pebbles in the entire world, it will sadden them, because, in that case, no matter how long the space of time they will live in Paradise, they will be expelled after this period. [ Mazhari ]\nIn any case, the notion that after a few ahqab the disbelievers will be released from Hell is contrary to the explicit texts and common consent of the Ummah, and as such it is unworthy of consideration, because the verse does not mention what will happen after the ahqab. It merely mentions that they will have to abide in Hell for ages [ ahqab ] '. This does not necessarily imply that there will be no Hell after ahqab or its non-believing inmates will be released. Therefore, Sayyidna Hasan ؓ says that no specific period has been defined for the inmates of Hell, so that they will be released after that. It is that which has no end to it. Whenever one hiqbah [ era ] is over, a new hiqbah will start; when the second era come to an end, a third hiqbah will start; when the third hiqbah ends, the fourth hiqbah will start; and it will carry on ad infinitum. Sayyidna Said Ibn Jubair ؓ also interprets the word ahqab as referring to 'the time which has no end to it. Whenever one era ends, a new era follows it until eternity'. [ Ibn Kathir and Mazhari ]. Ibn Kathir describes another possibility which Qurtubi supports and Mazhari adopts. The possibility is that the word taghin 'rebellious people' probably does not refer to the disbelievers, but to the people of Tauhid, who, on account of their false beliefs, fall into one of the categories of deviant groups. Traditionalists refer to them as ahl-ul-ahwa' 'heretics whose beliefs are not in keeping with the common consent of the People of Ahl-us-sunnah wal-jama'ah. In this case, the verse purports to say that they are the people of Tauhid, but bordered on the boundary of disbelief on account of false beliefs. They, however, did not cross into the boundary of explicit disbelief. They will therefore abide in Hell for the period of ahqab, and then discharged therefrom by virtue of the creed of tuhid.\nMazhari, in support of this possibility, has cited the Prophetic Hadith which was reported earlier on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ with reference to Musnad of Bazzar, in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that after the period of ahqab has passed, these people will be taken out of Hell. Abu Hayyan, however, disputes this on the grounds of the verses that follow the present verse:\nإِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا لَا يَرْ‌جُونَ حِسَابًا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا كِذَّابًا\n(They did not expect [ to face ] accounting [ of their deeds ], and they rejected Our signs totally....78:27-28)\nThese verses contradict the possibility that taghin 'rebellious people' could be referring to people of Tauhid and deviant groups, because in the concluding verses it is expressly mentioned that they explicitly reject reckoning and utterly deny the Prophets (علیہم السلام) . Likewise Abu Hayyan rejects out of hand Muqatil's opinion that this verse is abrogated.\nA group of commentators find a third interpretation of this verse. A statement after this verse, namely, لَّا يَذُوقُونَ فِيهَا بَرْ‌دًا وَلَا شَرَ‌ابًا إِلَّا حَمِيمًا وَغَسَّاقًا will taste nothing cool in it, nor a drink, except boiling water and pus...78:25) - is circumstantial clause to ahqab, in which case the verse purports to say that for the countless aeons of ahqab that they will be in Hell they will not be tasting any coolness of air nor any food or drink excepting for boiling water and [ scalding ] pus. When the ahqab is over, the condition may change, and other kinds of punishment may be imposed. The word hamim means 'intensely boiling water if brought near the face, it would burn its flesh, and when put into the stomach it would cut into pieces the internal organs'. The word ghassaq means 'blood and pus, and washings of wounds that will ooze from the inmates of Hell'.",
