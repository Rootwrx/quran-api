  "text": "وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَ‌اتِ مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا (And We have sent down from the rain-laden clouds abundant water,...78:14). The word mu'sirat is the plural of mu` sirah 'rain-laden cloud'. This indicates that rain comes down from the cloud. There are verses, however, that indicate that rain comes down from the sky. Those verses too probably refer to 'upper atmosphere'. There are many verses in the Qur'an where the word sama' is used in that sense. Having mentioned these Divine blessings, the Surah reverts to its original theme of Resurrection and Judgment:",
