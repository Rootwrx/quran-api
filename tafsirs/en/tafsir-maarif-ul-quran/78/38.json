They will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the Rahman [ the All-Merciful ] and speaks aright -78:38). Ruh (Spirit), according to some of the commentators, refers to the angel Jibra'il He has been mentioned before the other angels in general in order to show the greatness of his status. According to certain Prophetic traditions, Ruh is not an angel but a huge army of Allah. They have heads, hands and legs. In this interpretation, there will be two rows. One row will be that of Ruh and the other will be that of the angels.",
