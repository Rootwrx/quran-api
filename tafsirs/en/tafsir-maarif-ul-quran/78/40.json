  "text": "يَوْمَ يَنظُرُ‌ الْمَرْ‌ءُ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ day when one will see what his hands have sent ahead....78:40) Apparently, this refers to the Day of Judgment. Every person will see his deeds with his own eyes in the Plane of Gathering. This might happen in one of two ways: [ 1] his ledger of deeds will be given in his hands and he will see it; or [ 2] his deeds will appear in the Plane of Gathering, epitomized in a visible shape, as certain narratives confirm this. Still a third possibility exists. The word 'day' may refer to 'the day of death'. And the words 'will see' means to see in the grave or barzakh, as explained by Mazhari.\nوَيَقُولُ الْكَافِرُ‌ يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَ‌ابًا (and the disbeliever will say, \"0 would that I had become dust...78:40) Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ reports that on the Day of Resurrection the entire earth will become a plane surface where all human beings, Jinn, domesticated animals and wild animals will be gathered. If one animal had wronged another animal in the world, it will be given the opportunity to take its revenge. If a goat with horns had wronged a goat without horns, it will be granted the opportunity to take its avenge. When this phase is over, all animals will be commanded to become dust. They will become dust. At that moment the disbelievers will wish that they were also animals and would become dust like them, so that they would have been spared the torment of reckoning and punishment of Hell. We seek refuge in Allah from it! Allah knows best!\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah An-Naba'\nEnds here",
