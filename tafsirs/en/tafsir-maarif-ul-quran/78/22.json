  "text": "لِّلطَّاغِينَ مَآبًا ([ It is ] an abode for the rebellious people... 78:22). The combined sense of verses 21 and 22 is that the bridge of Hell is set in ambush for all, the good and the bad. They will have to go over it. But Hell is the abode of the rebellious people. The word taghin is the plural of taghi, being derived from tughyan, meaning 'rebellion'. Thus the word taghi refers to a 'person who exceeds the limit in disobeying the authority [ of Allah ] '. This is possible only when he gives up his faith. Hence, the word thin in this context would refer to the disbelievers. It may also refer to the stray groups of Muslims who have deviated from the limits of Qur'an and Sunnah, though they may not have adopted kufr expressly, such as Rawafid, Khawarij, Mu'tazilah and others. [ as in Mazhari ].",
