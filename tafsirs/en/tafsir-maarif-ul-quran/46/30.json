  "text": "كِتَابًا أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ (a book sent down after Musa). Here the words 'after Musa (علیہ السلام) have been taken by some exegetes to indicate that these jinns were Jews, because Injil that was revealed to Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) after Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) ، has not been mentioned. But there is no clear narration to support this inference. That they did not refer to Injil cannot be a sufficient proof for the jinns being Jews. Another reason for not mentioning Injil may be that Injil follows Torah in most commandments, and the Qur'an, like Torah, is an independent Book, having different commands, rules and regulations. It is likely that the underlying idea was to state that the Qur'an is the Book which is independent like Torah.",
