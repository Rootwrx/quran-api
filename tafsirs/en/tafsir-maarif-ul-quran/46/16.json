A quotation from Sayyidna ‘Ali ؓ which is given below also indicates that sense of the verse is general. Ibn Kathir has reported the narration of Muhammad Ibn Hatib (رح) that once he was with Sayyidna ‘Ali ؓ along with some other persons who blamed Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ for some wrong-doings. There upon Sayyidna ‘Ali ؓ said:\nکان عثمان ؓ تعالیٰ عنہ من الّذین قال اللہ تعالیٰ فیھم اُولٰٓیٔکَ الَّذینَ نَتَقَبَّل عنھُم اَحسَن مَا عَمِلُواونَتَجَاوَزُ عن سَیِّاٰتِھِم فِی اَصحابِ الجَنَّنۃِ وَعدَ الصِّدقِ الَّذِی کَانُوا یُوعَدُونَ ۔ قال واللہ عثمان واصحاب عثمان ؓ تعالیٰ عنہم ، قالھا ثلاثا۔ (ابن کثیر)\n(` Uthman was one of those people about whom Allah Ta’ ala has said: \"Such are the people from whom We accept the best of what they did, and overlook their evils, (so they will be) among the people of Paradise according to the true promise that was made to them.\" (46:16) I swear by Allah that ` Uthman and his companions were examples of this verse.\" Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ repeated this three times.",
