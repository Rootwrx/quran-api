Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) came before him as a messenger, and Torah was revealed to him which is accepted by all these Jews and Christians. Secondly, it supports the verse 10 above, because Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and Torah themselves are witnesses to the Holy Prophet ﷺ being the messenger of Allah and the Qur'an being Allah's Book.",
