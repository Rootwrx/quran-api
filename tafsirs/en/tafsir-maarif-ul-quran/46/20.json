  "text": "أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَاتِكُمْ فِي حَيَاتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا (\"You have consumed your good things in your worldly life - 46:20), It means that the infidels will be told that they had already been awarded delights, luxuries and enjoyment in the worldly life for whatever good deeds they had done there; now there is nothing left for them in the Hereafter. It is known from this verse that the good deeds of disbelievers do not have any worth in the Hereafter due to lack of belief or faith, but Allah Ta’ ala compensates them in this world. The riches and wealth, honour and dignity, etc., which are enjoyed by disbelievers in this world are all recompense for their good deeds, benevolence, sympathy, truthfulness, etc. This rule does not apply to Mu'mins (believers) that if they get any delights, riches and wealth in this world, they would be deprived of their right in the Hereafter.\nIncentive for avoiding worldly delights and luxuries\nThe punishment stated in this verse for the disbelievers is because of their being engrossed in worldly enjoyments. So, the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، his noble companions\tand Tabi` in رحمۃ اللہ علیہم had made it a habit to avoid worldly enjoyments, as is evident from their lives. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had charged Sayyidna Mu` adh ؓ ، when sending him to Yemen, to keep on avoiding the luxuries of this world. Sayyidna ‘Ali ؓ has reported the Holy Prophet ﷺ saying that one who is happy with Allah Ta’ ala giving him scanty sustenance finds Allah Ta’ ala also happy at his meager deeds.
