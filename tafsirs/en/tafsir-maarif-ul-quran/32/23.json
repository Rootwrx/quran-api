  "text": "Commentary\nThe word: لِقَاء (liqa' ) in the first verse (23) cited above: فَلَا تَكُن فِي مِرْ‌يَةٍ مِّن لِّقَائِهِ (so do not be in doubt about receiving it) means meeting. Whose meeting with whom? In determining it precisely in the verse, the sayings of commentators differ. According to one of these, the pronoun in: لِّقَائِهِ (liga'ihi) has been taken to be reverting to: اَلکِتَاب (al-hitab: the Book), that is, the Qur'an, which releases the sense that 'the way Allah Ta’ ala gave the Book to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) ، you too should entertain no doubt about receiving your Book.' This is supported by similar words used about the Qur'an in another verse: وَإِنَّكَ لَتُلَقَّى الْقُرْ‌آنَ (And indeed you [ 0 Muhammad ] do receive the Qur'an - An-Naml, 27:6) (Bayan ul-Qur'an, Khulasah Tafsir)\nOn the other hand, its tafsir from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas and Qatadah ؓ has been reported as follows: The pronoun in: لِّقَائِهِ (liqa'ihi: read as 'meeting him' ) reverts to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and given in this verse is the news that the Holy Prophet ﷺ will be meeting Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and it has been said that he should have no doubt in the eventuality of his meeting with Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) . Accordingly, a meeting in the night of al-Mi` raj (the ascent to the heavens) stands proved on the authority of Sahih Ahadith. Then, also proved is the meeting on the day of Qiyamah.\nAnd Hasan al-Basri (رح) explains it by saying: The way Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) was given a Book, then people belied and harassed him, the prophet of Islam too should anticipate that he will have to face similar treatment at the hands of his people. Therefore, he should not grieve over the pains inflicted by disbelievers. In fact, he should take that as the blessed practice of prophets, and endure.",
