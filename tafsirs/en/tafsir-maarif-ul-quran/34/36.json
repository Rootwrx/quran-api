  "text": "This very subject has been taken up in several other verses of the noble Qur'an. In Surah al-Mu'minun, it was said:\nأَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُم بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ نُسَارِ‌عُ لَهُمْ فِي الْخَيْرَ‌اتِ بَل لَّا يَشْعُرُ‌ونَ\nDo they think that by consistently providing them with wealth and children, We are accelerating the (real) good things to them? The fact, however, is that they do not understand (the reality) - 23:55, 56.\nAnd the reality is that wealth and children that make man negligent of Allah become a curse for him. Then, in a verse of Surah At-Taubah, it was said:\nوَلَا تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَأَوْلَادُهُمْ ۚ إِنَّمَا يُرِ‌يدُ اللَّـهُ أَن يُعَذِّبَهُم بِهَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَافِرُ‌ونَ\nAnd their wealth and children should not attract you. Allah only wants to punish them with these in this world and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers - 9:85.\nIn that case, it will end up into the everlasting punishment of the Hereafter. As for punishing through wealth and children right here in this world, it means that they become so involved in and infatuated with wealth and property that they never find the time to think about their ultimate fate or turn towards Allah and 'Akhirah - the end of which is punishment that will last forever. Then there are many who have wealth and children both. It is within this world that, for the sake of wealth and children, rather, through the wealth and children, they have to suffer from thousands of distresses and pains. As such, their punishment starts taking effect right from this very world.\nAccording to a narration of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Allah Ta’ ala does not see you or your wealth. He sees your hearts and your deeds – (reported by Ahmad, Ibn Kathir)",
