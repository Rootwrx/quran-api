  "text": "Commentary\nAccording to most commentators, the attending condition described in verse 51: وَأُخِذُوا مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِ‌يبٍ (and they will be seized from a place near at hand) refers to the Day of Resurrection (al-hashr) from the terror of which disbelievers and sinners will not be able to escape even if they try to do so. In our normal experience in this world, when a culprit runs away, he has to be searched for. Something like that will not happen in the present case. In fact, all of them will be seized from where they are located. No one will have the chance to escape. Others have taken this time to be that of the agony of death, that is, when the time of death comes, they will be terrified and, unable to extricate themselves from the hands of the angels, they will be seized where they are with their soul taken out.",
