  "text": "Verse 48: إِنَّ رَ‌بِّي يَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ (Say,\" My Lord sends forth the Truth. He is the Best-Knower of the Unseen.\" - 34:48) Say, \"Truth has come, and falsehood (has vanished so as it) has no power to produce or reproduce (anything) \". It means that my Lord who is the Knower of the Unseen strikes out the false with a throw of the truth (as a result of which the false is destroyed, as it was said: فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ 'and there it is all gone'. Al-Anbiya', 21:18). Literally, the word: قَذَف (qadhf) means to hit by throwing. Here, the purpose is to highlight the truth as set against the false. Perhaps, there may be a wise consideration behind expressing this phenomenon through the word: یَقذِف (yaqdhifu: He throws), may be the purpose is to point out to the after effect of the truth prevailing over the false. It appears here in the form of a simile as the throwing of something heavy over something feeble that shatters into pieces. So it happens in the confrontation between truth and falsehood when the later lies shattered. Therefore, it was said next: وَمَا يُبْدِئُ الْبَاطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ (and falsehood has vanished so as it has no power to produce or reproduce anything) that is, falsehood becomes so incapacitated in the face of truth that it can neither originate anything nor can it bring it back.",
