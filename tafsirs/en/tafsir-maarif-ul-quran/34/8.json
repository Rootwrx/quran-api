  "text": "They say: أَفْتَرَ‌ىٰ عَلَى اللَّـهِ كَذِبًا أَم بِهِ جِنَّةٌ (Has he forged a lie against Allah, or is there a madness in him?\"- 34:8). The drive of their remark is that the idea that all totally disintegrated particles of the body will stand reassembled together, turn into the human body once again and be alive as well, is so unreasonable, to start with, that there remains practically no question of entertaining or accepting it. Therefore, this claim of the Holy Prophet ﷺ is either a deliberate attempt to fabricate a lie against Allah Ta’ ala, or the person who says so is insane and no premise of his statement is correct.",
