  "text": "The verse no. 184 has refuted the false notion of the disbelievers that the Holy Prophet , 1n was a man of unsound mind or was possessed by devil. It said:\nأَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُ‌وا مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ‌ مُّبِينٌ\n\"Have they not reflected that with their friend there is no madness? He is but an open warner.\"\nThe verse said that a little reflection on their part shall be enough to prove that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was neither a man of unsound mind, nor was he under the influence of Jinns. His matchless wisdom and knowledge is an obvious feature of his personality. Those having claim to wisdom and knowledge are astoundingly bewildered how a man of such extraordinary insight and sagacity could be blamed of madness? Blaming him with madness, in fact, is madness itself. He is only an elucidator of realities and a warner against the punishment from Allah.",
