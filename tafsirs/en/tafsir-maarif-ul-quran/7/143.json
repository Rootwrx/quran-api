  "text": "The verse 143 carries the phrase لن ترانی “ you shall never see me”. The phrase has an indication that sighting of Allah is not impossible, but that he (Musa علیہ السلام) cannot endure it with his present physical disposition. Had it been impossible, the phrase would have been لن اری : “ I cannot be seen” (Mazhari). This allows that sighting of Allah is a logical possibility even in this world but at the same time this verse has precluded the possibility of its occurrence in this world. This is also the unanimous view of the majority of scholars. The following hadith has been included in Sahih Muslim:\nلن یری احد منکم رَبِّہِ حتی یموت\n“ None among you can see his Lord unless he dies.”\nThe second phrase, وَلَـٰكِنِ انظُرْ‌ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ “ But look at the mount” is a physical emonstration of the fact that in his present state the addressee is not capable of enduring the impact of such experience.\nThereafter, Allah actually demonstrated this fact by a flash of His appearance on the Mount of Sinai which could not stand it and was smashed into pieces.\nThe next phrase is فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَ‌بُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ \"So when his Lord appeared to the Mount.\" The Arabic word, تَجَلَّىٰ \"Tajalli\" signifies exposure or disclosure. According to the Spiritual masters (Sufis) the word signifies seeing something indirectly through some other means, like seeing certain thing reflected in the mirror. The word, therefore, cannot signify 'seeing'. It is also inferred by this very verse because this verse has negated the possibility of seeing while it has mentioned the occurrence of تَجَلَّىٰ 'Tajalli' or appearance on the mount of Sinai.\nImam Ahmad, Tirmidhi and Hakim have reported on the authority of the Companion Anas ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ recited this verse and placing his thumb on the tip of his little finger said that only this much of Allah's light was exposed to the mount of Sinai which made it burst into pieces. This does not necessarily mean that the whole of the mount was not shattered, but the part of the mountain directly exposed to light might have been affected.",
