  "text": "Sajdah: Some merits and rules\nSajdah (prostration) as a unit of the Islamic ` Ibadah of Salahhas been mentioned here exclusively since it occupies a distinct place among the rest of the units of Salah.\nIt appears in Sahih Muslim that a person asked Sayyidaa Thawban ؓ 'tell me about something I should do that will take me to Paradise.' Sayyidna Thawban remained silent. He repeated the question. He still remained silent. When he came up with the question the third time, he said, 'I had asked the same question from the Holy Prophet ؓ and he had ordered me to make sajdah repeatedly because for every sajdah you do, Allah Ta` ala increases a rank and forgives a sin.' This person says that following his meeting with Sayyidna Thawban ؓ he met Sayyidna Abu al-Darda' ؓ . He put the same question to him and he was given the same answer.\nAgain in Sahih Muslim, but on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ ، it has been reported that the Holy Prophet ؓ said, 'a servant of Allah is closest to his Lord when in sajdah.\nTherefore, when you are in a state of sajdah, pray most ardently, for it is strongly hoped that it will be answered. 1'\n1. It should be borne in mind that supplication in sajdah should be in nafl salah and using the Arabic prayers either mentioned in the Holy Qur'an or in the sunnah of the Holy Prophet . However, in a sajdah meant for supplication only, one can pray in whatever language he wishes (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)\nLet us bear in mind that Sajdah, by itself, is not a recognized act of ` Ibadah. Therefore, according to Imam Abu Hanifah, prostrating in Sajdah abundantly means that one should offer nafl Salah abundantly. An increased number of nafl Salah would naturally result in an increased number of Sajdahs.\nBut, if a person were to go in Sajdah alone and supplicate after that, it really does not matter. As for the instruction to supplicate in Sajdah, it is particular to Nafl Salats. It is not mandatory.\nSurah al-A` raf ends here. Its last verse is an Ayah of Sajdah (requiring the person reciting and the person listening to prostrate in Sajdah). According to a report from Sayyidna Abu Hurairah al appearing in Sahih Muslim, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, ` when a son of Adam recites a verse of Sajdah and then prostrates in Sajdah, the Shaitan runs crying. He says: Alas, man was asked to prostrate in Sajdah and when he obeyed, Paradise became his home, and I was asked to prostrate in Sajdah and when I disobeyed, Hell became my home.'",
