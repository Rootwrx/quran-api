  "text": "The verse 154 describes that the Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) lifted up the tablets of the Torah which contained guidance and blessing for those who feared Allah. The Arabic word: نُسخَہ 'Nuskha' rendered as contents signifies a writing copied from a book or other writings. There are certain reports that inform us that the tablets had broken at the time the Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) had put them away quickly. This time Allah gave him the Torah written on some other material.",
