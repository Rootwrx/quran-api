  "text": "The sixth punishment has been mentioned in the Qur'an by the Arabic word: رِجز 'Rijz' which signifies plague or pestilence. The number of Egyptians killed in this plague is reported to have been more than seventy thousand. They were relieved of this punishment by the prayer of the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) . Again they broke their promise as before. Now, when they showed no sign of understanding they were finally caught by the last punishment - the death. Leaving behind all their lands, houses and possessions they chased the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) and his people and were drowned in the sea.",
