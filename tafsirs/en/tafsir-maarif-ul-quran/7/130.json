  "text": "The next verses speak of the events that led Pharaoh and his people to a number of calamities sent to them as punishment and finally led them to their death. The first heavenly punishment came to them in the form of famine. According to historical reports this famine lasted for seven years.\n\"And We seized the people of the Pharaoh with years of famine and loss of fruits, so that they may take lesson. So when something good came to them they said, 'This is our right.' And if they suffered from something evil, they ascribed it as an ill omen to Musa and those with him. Listen, their omen lies with Allah only, but most of them do not know.\"\nThe first verse has described the famine with two phrases: 'years of famine' and 'loss of fruits.' The respected Companion ` Abdullah ibn ` Abbas Ø“ and the commentator Qatadah have said that the punishment of drought was for the people of the rural areas, while people living in cities and towns were punished by the loss of fruits.",
