  "text": "Pharaoh was frightened\nIt is to be noted that the Pharaoh was in some degree successful in keeping his ignorant people in their former ignorance through his clever and false statements, but at the same time, they strangely noted that all the fury and rage of Pharaoh was limited to the sorcerers only. He did not dare say a word against the prophets Musa (علیہ السلام) and Harun who were his real opponents. This is obvious from the following statement of his people: أَتَذَرُ‌ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُ لِيُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ وَيَذَرَ‌كَ وَآلِهَتَكَ ۚ\"Do you leave Musa (علیہ السلام) and his people alone to spread disorder in the land, even when he abandons you and your gods?\"\nPharaoh had no convincing answer to this question. He only said, سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِي نِسَاءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُ‌ونَ \"We shall slaughter their sons and let their women live, and we have full power over them.\"\nAccording to the commentators of the Holy Qur'an, Pharaoh tried to satisfy his people saying that by killing their males and leaving their women alive, he shall totally eliminate them within a period of time. Their women shall be spared to serve his people as maid servants. In fact, Pharaoh was so frightened by the miracle of the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) that even at this occasion when he was threatening to kill all the men of Israelites, he could not utter a single word of threat against Musa and Harun (علیہ السلام) Maulana Rumi said:\nھر کہ ترسید از حق وتقوی گزید\nترسید ازوی جن و انس و ھر کہ دید\n\"Whoever adopts 'Taqwa' and fears Allah is feared by all human beings and spirits\" .\nThe above statement of Pharaoh's people, 'Even when he abandons you and your gods' makes us understand that Pharaoh himself used to worship other gods, even though he claimed to be the god of his people. The law about killing of the males of the Israelites and leaving their women alive was now promulgated the second time. The first time it was put into force prior to the birth of the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) . He was witnessing the failure of this law up to this day which was evident from the huge crowd of the Israelites present at this occasion. When Allah intends to bring disgrace to a people, all they contrive leads to nothing but disaster. We shall soon see that this tyranny and oppression, at last, led him and his people to an ignominious end.",
