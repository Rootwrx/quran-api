  "text": "In the second verse (56), it was said: وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَاحِهَا (And do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order). Two antonyms have appeared here: صَلَاح (salah) and: فَسَاد (fasad). 'Salah' means the state of being good, correct, right, proper or set in order as in the translation. Then, Fasad refers to the state of evil, corruption, mischief, disorder. Imam Raghib al-Isfahan has said in his Mufradat al-Qur'an that Fasad refers to something going beyond the limits of moderation, whether this crossing over is insignificant or enormous, and the measure of an increase or decrease in every Fasad depends on this crossing of the limits of moderation. The farther the limits are crossed, Fasad will increase. Fasad means to make things bad and Islah means to correct, reform or put into order. Therefore, the verse: وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَاحِهَا means: ` do not make things bad on the earth after that Allah has made it good and proper.'\nImam Raghib has also said: There are several forms in which Allah Ta` ala makes something right, correct and proper. Firstly, He began by creating them right, correct and proper, as in: وَ اَصلَحَ بَالَھُم ' (He will improve their condition - 47:2). Secondly, removed was the corruption that had entered into something, as in: یُصلِح لَکُم اَعمَالَکُمُ (That He may make your deeds good and right - 33:71). Thirdly, that a command is given to put things in order. This verse carries a command of abstention from mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. Here, the ordering of the earth may be taken in two senses. Firstly, the outward propriety that it was made arable and capable of growing trees with rains made to come from clouds resulting in flowers and fruits as gifts from plants and trees - and that the earth was made the source of life support for human beings and animals.\nThe second sense is that Allah Ta'ala set things right on the earth inwardly and spiritually - by sending His messengers and Books and instructions and purifying it from Kufr and Shirk and error. It is quite possible that the verse means both inward and outward order in a total way. Thus, the verse would now mean that Allah Ta'-al-a has put the earth in proper order both physically and spiritually and now you should not create disorder or engineer evil in there through your acts of sin and disobedience.\nWhat is Order or Disorder on the Earth and at have Sins of People to do with it?\nThe way there are two aspects of order (Islah), the outward and the inward, or the physical and the spiritual, in the same way, there are two aspects of disorder (Fasad) also. As for the outward or physical order of the earth is concerned, that it be right and proper, it will be realized that Allah Ta'ala has made it to be a mass or body which is neither liquid as water making it difficult to settle down upon it, nor is it hard as rock or iron which could not be dug up. It has been created to be in a middle state so that human beings could make it soft and smooth lending itself to being farmed and become capable of growing plants and trees and flowers and fruits. Then, they could also dig it up to sink wells and make moats and canals, lay strong foundations for houses to live; and then, right in and out of the earth, He created things and circumstances which would help habitat the earth, make vegetation, trees, flowers and fruits grow in it; and then, from the outside, He created wind, light, heat and chill, and made water rain through clouds over it so that trees could grow. And brought in service were stars and planets from where warm and cold rays were cast on them which filled flowers and fruits with colour and juice. Human beings were endowed with intelligence through which they dug up raw materials from the earth, like iron, copper, wood and so many other metals and rocks which they harnessed into a new world full of industries and artifices. This is the outward ordering of the earth which was brought into effect by the perfect power of Allah Ta` ala.\nAs for the inward and spiritual ordering of life is concerned, it depends on the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr), relationship with Allah تَعَّلُق مَع اَللہ (Ta'alluq ma' Allah) and on obedience to Him اِطَاعَت (Ita` ah). For this, to begin with, Allah Ta` ala has already placed in the heart of every human being a basic substance and urge to remember and to obey Him: أَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَ‌هَا وَتَقْوَاهَا (Then, He inspired it [ that is, inspired the soul or heart instinctively ] as to its wrong and as to its right -91:8). So, all around human beings not a particle remains in which Allah Ta` ala has not placed wonders of His perfect power and His astounding creativity, seeing which, even a person of average understanding would be moved to say: فَتَبَارَ‌كَ اللَّـهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِينَ (So blessed be Allah, the Best to create! - 23:14). Other than these manifestations, He sent His messengers, revealed His Books through which the essential linkage between the Creator and the created was fully established.\nThus, the command given is that now that the earth has been placed in proper order, outwardly and inwardly, let it not go bad through human misdeeds.\nAs pointed out earlier, like Islah or order having two aspects, Fasad or disorder also has two aspects, the outward and the inward. This saying of Allah Ta` ala forbids both.\nThough the recurring insistence of the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet ﷺ is on spiritual order as a cardinal duty which, in effect, aims to stop any emergence of spiritual disorder as a counter possibility. But, in the world we live in, the linkage between the order and disorder of the physical and spiritual is such that any disorder in one becomes the source of disorder in the other. Therefore, when the Shari’ ah of the Qur'an has blocked the doors of spiritual disorder, it has also prohibited physical disorder. Theft, robbery, murder and all ways of immodesty and indecency create all sorts of physical and spiritual disorder in the world. So, stern restrictions were placed and punishments proposed particularly against such evil acts while common sins and crimes were also prohibited - because, every sin becomes the source of physical disorder at some time, and that of spiritual disorder at some other. And, if looked at closely, every outward disorder becomes the cause of inward disorder, and conversely, every inward disorder be-comes the source of outward disorder.\nThat outward or physical disorder becomes the inevitable source of inward or spiritual disorder is obvious, for it is the contravention of the command to obey Divine injunctions - in fact, disobedience to Allah Ta` ala is another name for spiritual disorder. As for the chemistry of spiritual disorder and how it transforms itself as the cause of physical disorder, this can be discerned only through a little serious reflection. The reason is that this whole world and everything big and small in it was created by the Master of the domain of creation to wherever it ex-tends, and it is but subservient to His command. So far as human beings remain obedient to Allah, everything stands harnessed into their service as due and proper. But, when human beings start disobeying Allah Ta` ala, everything in the world starts disobeying human beings from behind a curtain through which they cannot see with their mortal eyes. But, it is by deliberation into the effects, properties, results and outcomes of these things that one does find the relevant proof of their becoming hostile very conclusively.\nIf taken with a surface view, human beings keep using all these things normally. When water goes down the throat, it does not refuse to quench thirst; food does not stop removing hunger and dress and home do not disappoint them by refusing to provide defence against heat and chill.\nBut, when looked at in terms of the ultimate outcome, it would appear that none of these things is fulfilling its assigned job - because, the real function and use of all these things is that they should provide peace and comfort, that anxieties are removed and sicknesses are cured.\nNow if you look at conditions prevailing in our world, you will realize that, despite the proliferation of things of comfort and the means and materials of curing diseases much beyond any expectations, the majority of human beings is victimized by extreme distresses and diseases. Never-known diseases and ever-new calamities seem to be the order of the day. No one, not even the highest among human beings, is contended and in peace in his or her station of life. In fact, the more these functional facilities and fruits of skill keep increasing in their output, the more increasing becomes the parallel manifestation of dis-eases, anxieties, disasters and hardships - very much like the saying in Urdu which means: ` The more they treat you, the more sick they make you.'\nIf modern man bewitched by the magic of energy and its material gains were to rise a little above his infatuation with things and technology, he will realize that all our efforts to invent and construct things and to lay the foundations of a society on top of them have flatly failed to give us peace and comfort which was our real purpose. There is no reason for this but that inward disorder we have been talking about which means that we have started disobeying our Rabb, our Creator and Master, so His creation has started disobeying us on the inward front - that it refuses to provide real peace and comfort for us, despite all our efforts at break-neck speed. To this the famous Maulana Rum' pointed out by saying that the elements of dust, air, water and fire, though they appear inert and sans sense yet, in reality, they too do possess a degree of intelligence which makes them work under the command of their Master.\nTo sum up, it can be said that sin, heedlessness towards Allah Ta` ala, and disobedience to Him do not only create spiritual disorder, but they also lead to the inevitable physical disorder. When the same Maulana Rumi' says that the cloud does not come to rain when you stop paying Zakah while from Zina (adultery) results an epidemic affecting all directions. This is no poetic imagination. This is a reality authentically supported by the Qur'an and Hadith. But, what becomes visible in this world is just a light sample of the ultimate punishment in the form of diseases, epidemics, storms, hurricanes and floods.\nTherefore, included in the sense of the verse: لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَاحِهَا (And do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order) are crimes and sins which cause disorder in the world physically and outwardly - and also included there are sin, disobedience, and heedlessness towards Allah Ta` ala. Therefore, immediately after in this verse, it was said: وَادْعُوهُ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا (And supplicate to Him in fear and hope). It means that it should be done in a way that, on the one hand, one has the fear of the Du` a.' remaining unanswered, while on the other hand, one has full hope tied to His mercy. These very twin attitudes of fear and hope are the two wings of the human soul on its journey with truth and fortitude. On these it flies high and through these it reaches superior ranks destined for it.\nThen, as the text obviously shows, the degree of fear and hope should be equal. Some ` Ulama have said that it is appropriate to keep fear dominate during life with health, so that there be no shortcoming in being obedient. And when comes the time to die, it is better to let hope dominate, because the strength to do what should have been done is not there anymore and there is nothing left to do except hope for the mercy of Allah Ta’ ala. (Al-Bahr Al-Muhit)\nAnd some researchers among scholars have said that the purpose is to hold on to the straight path of religion and be constant in obedience to Allah Ta` ala. Then, the temperaments and tastes of human beings differ. Some achieve this station of fortitude and constancy in obedience by keeping fear as the dominant factor. Others achieve these by keeping love and hope as dominating factors. So, whoever finds help' to achieve this purpose through either of these two options, should try to achieve it through that option.\nTo summarize the comments made about Du` a', it can be said that the first verse tells us about two rules of etiquette relating to Du'a': (1) That it be with humility and submission, and (2) that it be secret and low-voiced. These two qualities belong to the outward human physique - because \"tadarru\"' suggests that one should, while making Du` a', assume the looks and manners of someone weak, helpless and needy and should never allow it to be proud, arrogant or seemingly need-free. Then, that it be secret also relates to one's speech through the mouth and tongue.\nAs for the spiritual etiquette of Du'a' as given in this verse, there are two rules to be followed. These relate to the human heart. They require that the person making the Du` a' should feel the danger in his heart that his Du'a' may, perhaps, remain unanswered while, at the same time, he should also hope that his Du'a' may be answered - because becoming careless about one's errors and sins is contrary to 'Iman (faith) and losing hope in the infinite mercy of Allah Ta` ala is Kufr (disbelief). Both are impermissible extremes. The hope that a prayer will be answered can be entertained only when one keeps in between the two states of fear and hope.\nThen, at the end of the verse, it was said: إِنَّ رَ‌حْمَتَ اللَّـهِ قَرِ‌يبٌ مِّنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ (Surely, the mercy of Allah is close to the good in deeds). The hint given here is that, though there should be the two states of fear and hope present while making a Du` a', but, out of the two states, the option of hope is the weightier option - because the prayer is being made to the Lord of all the worlds the extent of Whose mercy cannot be conceived, and in whose generosity and favour there is no shortage or reluctance. He can answer the Du` a' of the worst of offenders, even the Du'a' of the Satan himself. Of course, should there be a danger of Du` a' remaining unanswered, that could only be possible on account of one's own misdeeds or due to the hanging curse of sins - because being good in deeds is necessary to become close to the mercy of Allah Ta` ala.\nTherefore, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has said that some people travel long distances, look like faqirs and raise their hands for Du` a' before Allah Ta` ala, but حَرَام haram is their food and حَرَام haram is their drink and حَرَام haram is their dress. So, how can a Du` a' made by such a person be answered? (Muslim, Tirmidhi from Sayyidna Abi Hurairah)\nAccording to another Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: The prayer of a servant of Allah keeps finding acceptance until such time that he does not pray for some sin or for the severance of some relationship - and that he does not make haste. The noble Companion asked about the meaning of ` making haste.' He said: It means that one may think - here I am making a Du` a' for all this time and it has not been answered yet - until he becomes disappointed and stops making Du` a'. (Muslim, Tirmidhi)\nAccording to yet another Hadith, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: Whenever you make Du` a' before Allah Ta` ala, do it in a state when you have no doubt about its being answered.\nIt means that one should keep his or her sight on the most extensive mercy of Allah Ta' ala and let the heart believe that the prayer being made shall be answered. This is not contrary to the danger one may feel that his or her sins may become an impediment in the acceptance of one's Du` a'. صلی اللہ تعَالیٰ علی نَبِیِّنَا وسلم",
