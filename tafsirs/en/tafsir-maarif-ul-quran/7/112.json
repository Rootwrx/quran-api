  "text": "These verses narrate the remaining part of the story of the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) . Seeing these wonders of staves turning into serpents and making his hand emitting strong white light, the Pharaoh should have been convinced and have believed in Musa (علیہ السلام) as the logic and sense demanded. But it is the common practice of the wrong-doers that they always seek false interpretations of the truth in order to conceal it, the Pharaoh and his people belied him instead, and said to the people that he was a great sorcerer and that he wanted to expel them from their homes and take over the rule of the country. The people of the Pharaoh suggested:\nأَرْ‌جِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَأَرْ‌سِلْ فِي الْمَدَائِنِ حَاشِرِ‌ينَ ﴿111﴾ يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ‌ عَلِيمٍ ﴿112﴾\n\"leave him and his brother alone for a while, and send men to the cities to collect and bring to you every expert sorcerer-111, 112.\"\nThe people of the Pharaoh said that there were many expert sorcerers in their cities who were capable of defeating Musa (علیہ السلام) .\nSome soldiers should be sent to collect and bring the sorcerers for this purpose. Sorcery and magic, being the custom of the day, the sorcerers enjoyed a high status among people. Allah sent Musa (علیہ السلام) with the miracles of the staff and white-lit hand so that people may clearly observe the misery of the sorcerers after entering into a contest with Musa (علیہ السلام) . It is the usual practice of Allah that He sends His prophets with miracles that are appropriate to the demand of the time. For instance, in the time of the prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) (the Jesus), Greek philosophy and medical sciences were at their zenith. He was, therefore, sent with the miraculous powers of restoring the sight of those who were born blind and cure the lepers instantly with a touch of his hand. In the time of the Holy Prophet ﷺ the Arabs were boastful of their oratory and linguistic capabilities. The Holy Qur'an was sent as the greatest of all miracles of the Holy prophet ﷺ .",
