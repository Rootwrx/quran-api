  "text": "The foregoing verses had a detailed account of the contest between the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) and the sorcerers and that after their defeat the sorcerers declared their faith in Allah. Some historical reports say that subsequent to their declaration of faith in Allah, six hundred thousand more people followed suit and declared their belief in Allah. Before this open contest there were only two individuals believing in Allah. Now a great army of people became Muslims. It was, obviously an embarrassing situation for the Pharaoh. Like a clever politician he managed to conceal his state of mind before the people, and changed the situation by putting the blame of conspiracy and rebellion on the sorcerers. He claimed that they had joined hands with Musa (علیہ السلام) and Harun in order to create disorder in the country. Then he said to the sorcerers, “ You have believed in him before I permitted you.\" This was a threat to the sorcerers on the one hand, and on the other, he tried to convince his people that the sorcerers made a hasty decision in accepting their faith and fell prey to the trap of Musa (علیہ السلام) and Harun. Otherwise, he would have also believed in him in case Musa (علیہ السلام) and Harun proved truthful in their claim.\nIt was a clever design of Pharaoh. He tried to keep his people stay in their former ignorance and make people believe that the contest was pre-plotted between the prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) and the sorcerers. He cleverly twisted the fact that the miracle of Musa (علیہ السلام) and the open conversion of the sorcerers to the true Faith was purely to expose the ignorance and falsehood of the Pharaoh. He turned it into a political issue by saying, \"So that you may expel its people from there.\" He wanted to make his people believe that they planned the whole matter to gain power over the country and expel the people from there.",
