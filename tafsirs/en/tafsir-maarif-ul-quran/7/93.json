  "text": "In the sixth (93) verse, it was said: فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ \t(So, he turned away from them). It means that, with punishment for his people in sight, Sayyidna Shu'aib (علیہ السلام) and his believing companions moved away from there. The majority of commentators says that these blessed souls left this place for Makkah al-Mu` azzamah where they stayed till the end.\nIt was his total disappointment with his people neck-deep in disobedience and contumacy which prompted him to pray that they be chastened. But, when the actual punishment came as a result of it, his heart pinched because of his prophetic concern and affection for them. Then, it was for the peace of his own heart that he said addressing his people: ` 0 my people, I have surely delivered to you the messages of my Lord, and wished you betterment. How, then, should I grieve over a disbelieving people?'",
