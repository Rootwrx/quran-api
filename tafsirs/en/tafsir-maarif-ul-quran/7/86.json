  "text": "In the last sentence of verse 86, it was said: وَاذْكُرُ‌وا إِذْ كُنتُمْ قَلِيلًا فَكَثَّرَ‌كُمْ ۖ وَانظُرُ‌وا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ. (And remember the time when you were few, then He increased you in number. And look, how was the fate of mischief makers). The twin aspects of persuasion and intimidation were employed to warn these people. The first was persuasion when they were reminded of the blessing of Allah who increased their insignificant numbers to become a large nation, or changed their economic weakness into need-free financial strength. Then, to chasten them through intimidation, it was said that they could do much better if they had a look at the sad end of peoples who had engineered disorder on the earth. The peoples of Nuh, ` Ad, Thamud and Lut (علیہم السلام) were examples of so many different punishments, which should help them understand their own situation and make the correction needed.",
