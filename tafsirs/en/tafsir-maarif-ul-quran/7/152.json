  "text": "The first verse (152) has warned those who took to the worship of the calf and persisted in it, of their sad fate in the Hereafter, and of disgraceful life in this world.\nThe worldly life is also affected by the sinful deeds\nA part of punishment of some sins is also given in this life. This is what happened to Samiri. The Prophet Musa (علیہ السلام) commanded him to live apart from the people not touching any one with his hand nor is he touched by any one of the people. Consequently for the rest of his life he lived a deserted life of seclusion, walking about with animals. No human did come near him.\nAl-Qurtubi has reported on the authority of the Companion Qatadah ؓ that his punishment from Allah was that whenever he touched someone or was touched by anyone of the people both suffered from fever. The author of Ruh al-Bayan has observed that the symptoms of this disease are still inherited by his generations. This verse has ended with this sentence. وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُفْتَرِ‌ينَ \"And this is how we recompense the fabricators.\" The Sheikh Sufyan ibn ` Uyainah has said that those who invent new things in the Shari'ah (take to Bid'ah) also commit the sin of fabrication and deserve such punishment. (Mazhari)\nImam Malik (رح) has also inferred from this verse that those who invent new practices in the Shari'ah deserve the same punishment of Allah's wrath in the Hereafter and disgrace in this life.
