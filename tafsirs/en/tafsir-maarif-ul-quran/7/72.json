  "text": "(5)-In the last verse (72) it was said that the final outcome of the entire struggle of Sayyidna Hud (علیہ السلام) against the contumacy of the people of ` Ad was that Allah Ta` ala kept Sayyidna Hud (علیہ السلام) and those who had believed in him safe from the punishment and cut off the root of those who had belied him - and they were not of those who would have believed.\nThis story leaves a trail of good counsel. It reminds heedless human beings to keep remembering Allah and take to a life style which is marked with obedience to Him. Then, to those who elect to reject honest advice and refuse to learn a lesson, it shows what to expect the end. And, as for preachers and reformers, it is a mirror of the prophetic method of communication in Tabligh and Islah.",
