  "text": "Commentary\nIn previous verses, Allah Ta` ala has mentioned some of His major and particular blessings. By pointing out to the creation of the heavens and the earth, the day and night, and the sun, moon and stars and how they serve human beings, the lesson driven home is that there is no power other than the sacred Being of Allah Ta` ala to take care of our needs and comforts, then, it becomes necessary that we should pray to none but Him for everything we need and take this turning to Him as the key of our success.\nMmmm48\nAlso mentioned in the first of the present verses are some other important blessings of this nature on which depends the existence and survival of human beings and the entire creation of the earth, for example, the rains and the trees, and farmlands and its produce. The difference is that the previous verses mentioned blessings relating to the upper domain while the present ones belong to the lower. (A1-Bahr Al-Muhit)\nSomething special has been identified in the second verse where it is said that these great Divine blessings are, though common to all parts of the earth - as rains, when they come, fall on rivers and mountains and on good and bad lands alike - but, what grows from the earth grows only from the land which has the quality to make it grow. Rocky and sandy lands do not derive benefit from these rains.\nThe conclusion drawn from the first verse is that the sacred Being which enables dead land to live again should have no problems in making human beings who once lived, then died, come to life once again. The conclusion so drawn is very clear. Then, there is another conclusion drawn from the second verse. It tells us that the guidance coming from Allah Ta` ala, the revealed Books, the blessed prophets, and the teachings and training undertaken by their deputies, the ` Ulama' and Mashaikh are like the rains, common to every human being. But, the way every land does not derive benefit from the mercy of rains, very similarly, the benefit of this spiritual rain is derived by those who have the ability to absorb it. As for those whose hearts are like rocky and sandy land not having the ability to absorb it and make growth possible, they would keep sticking to their ways of error despite clear guidance and signs and scriptures.\nThe conclusion thus drawn comes from the last sentence of the second verse which says: كَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّ‌فُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَشْكُرُ‌ونَ (Thus We alternate the verses for a people who pay gratitude). The sense is that the statement made was, though for everyone, yet, in the ultimate consequence, it proved beneficial only for those who had the capacity for it and realized its worth and value. Thus, the two verses quoted here cover the subject of human origin and return. Now, we can go to a fuller explanation of these two verses. The first verse begins by saying: وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُرْ‌سِلُ الرِّ‌يَاحَ بُشْرً‌ا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَ‌حْمَتِهِ (And He is the One who sends the winds carrying good news before His blessings). Here, the word: رِیح (ar-riyah) is the plural form of rih which means the wind, and ` bushran' means good news or glad tidings, and ` rahmat' refers to the rain of mercy, that is, it is Allah Ta` ala Himself who sends the winds to announce the good news of the coming rain of mercy.\nThe sense of the verse is that it is the customary ‘practice of Allah Ta` ala that He sends cool winds before the actual coming of rains which not only please people, but also, in a way, foretell that rains are coming much before they actually do. Therefore, these winds are a combination of two blessings. They themselves are beneficial for human beings and bracing for the creation in general. Then, they announce the rains before its coming. Human beings are a highly sensitive model of creation. Rains may stop them from doing what they need to do. If they could naturally find out about the coming rains ahead of time, they would be able to manage things for themselves. In addition to that, one's own person and belongings are not, at all times, defended against rains. By having early indications of rains, most would be able to take protective cover for themselves and their belongings.\nThen, it was said: حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَقَلَّتْ سَحَابًا ثِقَالًا\t(until when they lift up the heavy clouds). The word: سَحَّاب (sahib) means the cloud and: ثِقَال (thiqal) is the plural of thaqil which means heavy, that is, when the winds lift up the heavy clouds. Heavy clouds refer to clouds laden with water. They would, as if, travel riding on the shoulders of the wind, and thus, this water weighing thousands of tons comfortably rides high on the wings of the wind. How wonderful is the Divine design which uses no machines nor lets human beings slave for it. It is as simple as it can be - when Allah Ta` ala wills, vapours from the waters start rising upwards, turn into clouds and what you have is a sky-filling plane carrying a cargo of hundreds and thousands of gallons of water in its holds flying on the cushion of winds towards higher altitudes!\nAfter that, it was said: سُقْنَاهُ لِبَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ :\t(We drive them to a dead land). The word: سُوق (sauq) means to drive, herd or urge on towards a desired destination, and ` balad' means a town or habitation, and ` mayyit' means dead.\nThe verse, thus, means: ` When the winds lifted the heavy clouds up, We drove the clouds to a dead town.' Dead town refers to the habitation rendered desolate because of an scarcity of water. That a town or habitation has been named here in place of a common open land is appropriate in view of the real purpose of sending the rain because it is designed to feed the thirsty land and enable it to produce what human beings need. The place to do so would be a habituated area, not an inhabituated forest primarily where the growth of vegetation is less likely to serve the initial purpose.\nUpto this point, the description in the quoted verses proves the following: (1) That rains come through clouds, as commonly observed. This tells us that verses in which raining from the sky has been mentioned, there too, the word: سَمَاء (sama' ) refers to clouds. Then, not im-probable is the likelihood that clouds originate directly from the skies - as opposed to monsoons originating from the waters - and bring rains. (2) That clouds go in a particular direction and over a particular land area is something related directly to Divine command. It is He who gives the command for rains to fall when He wills, where He wills and as much as He wills. The clouds implement the Divine command.\nIt is something observed everywhere. There are occasions when a town or habitation would have heavy over-head clouds, and they would very much be in need of rains, but the clouds would not let them have even a drop of water. Instead, it would go to a town or habitation for which there is a quota of water as Divinely determined, and it would be only there that it would rain. No one has the ability or the daring to acquire water from these clouds at any other place, other than the town or habitation earmarked to have it.\nWeather scientists have determined rules about the movement of monsoons based on which they can tell the course of a monsoon rising from the waters of the sea and identify where and how much it would rain. There are meteorological bureaus set up for this purpose in many countries. But, experience shows that news released by these depart-ments frequently turn out to be contrary to fact. When what is contrary is the Divine command itself, their rules become ineffective. Winds and rain-laden clouds turn towards somewhere else, contrary to foretold news, and weather experts cannot do much about it.\nIn addition to that, any other rules and regulations proposed by meteorologists, they too are not contrary to the proposition that the movement of clouds obeys the Divine command - because it is the customary practice of Allah Ta` ala that, in all affairs of this world, the Divine command manifests itself from behind the curtains of physical causes. Human beings pick up these very causes and formulate some rule or regulation based on them. Otherwise, reality lies elsewhere.\nAfter that, it was said: فَأَنزَلْنَا بِهِ الْمَاءَ فَأَخْرَ‌جْنَا بِهِ مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَ‌اتِ (We pour down water, then, with it We bring forth of all the fruits).\nAnd then, at the end of the verse, it was said: كَذَٰلِكَ نُخْرِ‌جُ الْمَوْتَىٰ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُ‌ونَ (This is how We bring forth all the dead [ on the day of Qiyamah ], so that you may observe advice). Thus, the sense of the verse is: ` The way We have given new life to the dead land and have brought out from it trees, flowers and fruits, similarly, on the day of Qiyamah, We shall have the dead rise once again after their having been dead. And these examples have been set forth so that you would have the opportunity to reflect and deliberate.\nAccording to a narration of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: صُور (Sur : Horn) will be blown twice on the day of Qiyamah. On the first صُور Sur, the whole world will perish. Nothing will remain alive. On the second صُور Sur, a new world will come into being. The dead will become alive.' The Hadith also mentions ` an interval of forty years between the two blowings of the صُور Sur and rains would continue to fall throughout these forty years. During this period, the body parts of every dead human being and animal will become assembled into them giving everyone a complete skeleton. Then, at the time of the blowing of the second صُور Sur, رُوح Ruh (soul) will enter these corpses. They will rise alive.' A major portion of this narration can be seen in Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Some portions have been taken from Kitab al-Ba’ th of Ibn Abi Dawud.",
