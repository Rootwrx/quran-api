  "text": "In the second verse (204), we have been told that the Holy Qur'an has come as mercy for the believers. But, in order to benefit from this mercy, there are some conditions and rules of conduct. These have been delineated in the form of a general address as: وَإِذَا قُرِ‌ئَ الْقُرْ‌آنُ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ وَأَنصِتُوا (And when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it and be silent).\nThere are different reports about the background of these verses and about whether this injunction has appeared about the recitation of the Qur'an in Salah, or in Khutbah, or relates to the recitation of the Qur'an in an absolute sense, be it in Salah or Khutbah or in some other condition. But, according to the majority of commentators, the correct position is that the way the words of the verse are general, so the rule laid down therein too is generally applicable to all conditions - except some particular occasions.\nTherefore, the followers of Hanafi School have taken this verse to prove that the persons offering their prayer behind an Imam (i.e. the muqtadis) should not recite. Even Muslim jurists who have directed the muqtadis to recite Alfatihah behind the Imam, they too, having kept this verse in view have suggested that a muqtadi should recite only in an interval when the Imam is silent. However, this is not the appropriate occasion to take up this debate. Those interested may refer to standard works, brief or detailed, written by scholars on the issue.\nThe main subject of the verse is not but that the people for whom the Qur'an has been declared to be mercy should realize the condition that they have to recognize the etiquette and respect aligned with the Qur'an and observe it literally in practice. Then, the cardinal etiquette of the Qur'an is that listeners should lend their ears to it when recited and remain silent.\nThe sense of lending ears to it not only includes listening to it but also obeying it and making the effort of acting in accordance with its injunctions. (Maharl and Qurtubi) Then, by saying: لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْ‌حَمُونَ (so that you may be blessed) at the end of the verse, a clear hint is given that the mercy of Qur'an depends on the observance of rules of etiquette mentioned above.\nSome important rules relating to listening and remaining silent when Qur'an is being recited\nIn contrast with what has been said above, it is obvious that whoever flouts these rules and shows disrespect to the Qur'an will deserve Divine wrath, not mercy.\nAs for listening to the recitation of the Qur'an in the Salah and remaining silent therein, Muslims generally know about it - though, they do fall short in practice. Some of them would not even be aware of the Surah recited by the Imam. For such people, it is imperative that they should realize the greatness of the Qur'an, and listen to it attentively. This Islamic legal norm applies to the Khutbah of Jumu'ah etc. In addition to this verse, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has particularly said about the Khutbah:\nاَذا خرجَ الاِمَام فَلَا صلٰوۃ وَ لَا کَلَام\nWhen the Imam comes out (for Khutbah), then, there is no Surah and no conversation.\nAnd it also appears in a Hadith that no one should say anything to anyone during Khutbah, not even a verbal advice is allowed to be given to another person to keep silence (if it has to be done, making a sign by hand should be enough). The objective is to emphasize that, during the Khutbah, no conversation of any kind, tasbih, durud or Salah or acts of similar nature are permissible.\nMuslim jurists have said that the rule which applies to the Khutbah of Jumu'ah applies to the Khutbah of the two ` Eid prayers and that of Nikah (marriage) for, at that time, listening to it and remaining silent is obligatory (wajib).\nHowever, in case someone is reciting on his own under usual conditions other than Salah and Khutbah, the question arises: Will others be required to be silent and listen to it? Whether or not would it be obligatory (wajib) on them? The positions taken by Muslim jurists in this matter differ. Some consider listening and remaining silent in this condition too as wajib and doing against it a sin. It is for this reason that they have ruled that it is not permissible for anyone to recite the Qur'an in a loud voice at places where people are busy doing their chores or are resting. They have also said that anyone who recites the Qur'an in a loud voice in such surroundings shall be a sinner. This is as it appears in Khulasatu 1-Fatawa and other juristic works.\nBut, some other jurists have distinguished different situations from one another by saying that listening attentively is wajib only on occasions where the Qur'an is being recited for the express purpose of being listened to - such as, in Salah and Khutbah etc. And should it be that someone is reciting on his own, or some people are doing their own recitation at one place, then, it is not wajib to listen and be silent. The reason is that it stands proved on the authority of sound Ahadith that the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to recite the Qur'an in his nightly prayers in a raised voice. At that time, his blessed wives would be sleeping. At times, his voice could also be heard from outside his roomette.\nThere is a Hadith in al-Bukhari and Muslim. It says that the Holy Prophet ﷺ made a stop on his journey and when morning came he said, 'I recognized my Ash'arite companions by the voices of their recitation of Qur'an during the darkness of the night and was able to pinpoint the direction and location of their tents - though, I had no idea during the day as to where they stay.\nThis event shows that the Holy Prophet ﷺ never asked these Asharite companions as to why they were reciting the Qur'an in a loud voice, nor did he tell those sleeping that they all had to get up and listen to the Qur'an when it was being recited.\nAs based on narratives such as these, jurists have given some leeway in the case of recitation outside Salah. But, they all consider it better and preferable to listen and be silent when the sound of the recitation of the Qur'an comes from somewhere - even if it is outside the Salah. For this reason, in places where people are resting or working, it is not appropriate to recite the Qur'an in a loud voice.\nThis exposes the error of people who turn their radios to full volume at the time some program of recitation from the Qur'an comes on the air, particularly at places and gatherings where the crowd would not listen to it attentively. Similarly, the practice of relaying the recitation of the Qur'an from the public address systems of mosques late at night, in a manner that the sound goes out and disturbs the sleep of the sleeping or the work of the working, is not correct.\n` Allamah ibn al-Humam has written that, at the time the Imam in Salah, or the Khatib in Khutbah, is reciting something about the Jannah or Jahannam, then, at that time, it is not permissible even to pray for Jannah or seek refuge from Jahannam. The reason is that, according to this verse, the promise of mercy from Allah Ta` ala is for the person who remains silent when the Qur'an is being recited - and whoever does not remain silent, to him the promise does not apply.\nYes, if one supplicates voicelessly after the recitation of such verses during his na f Z prayers, it is an act proved by Sunnah, and is worthy of reward as well.
