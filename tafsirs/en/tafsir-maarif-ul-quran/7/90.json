(Al-Bahr Al-Muhit from 'Ata' )\nThe account of the punishment of these wicked people was given in the fourth verse (91) in the following words: فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّ‌جْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دَارِ‌هِمْ جَاثِمِينَ ﴿91﴾ (So, the earthquake seized them, and they were [ found dead ] in their homes fallen on their knees).",
