  "text": "Commentary\nلَا أُقْسِمُ بِهَـٰذَا الْبَلَدِ (I swear by this city...90:1). The particle la ('no' ) in the beginning of this sentence has no meaning here. Such particles in Arabic language are commonplace. However, the more appropriate view is that when a Surah begins with a la (no) followed by an oath, it was revealed in refutation to a false assumption of the opponents. In other words, Allah is saying, 'No, what you [ the unbelievers ] are saying or thinking is not correct, but the truth is what We are swearing about...'. The word al-balad 'the City' refers to the Holy City of Makkah, as in Surah At-Tin [ 95:3] where Allah swears an oath 'by this peaceful City [ of Makkah ] وھٰذا البَلَدِ الاَمِین . The adjective attached to the 'City' is 'peaceful'. This shows the superiority and honour of Makkah over other cities. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Adiyy ؓ reports that when the Holy Prophet of Allah ﷺ was migrating from Makkah to Madinah, he addressed the city of Makkah and said: \"By Allah, you are dearer to Allah than the entire earth. If I was not forced out of this place, I would never have abandoned you.\" [ Transmitted by Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah vide Mazhari ].",
