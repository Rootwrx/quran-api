The terrible punishment of the Hereafter is described in these verses. First, there is the mention of ankal which is the plural of nakal. It denotes 'fetter, chain, shackle'. Then, there is the mention of 'flaming fire'. Then, verse [ 13] describes the 'choking food' the inmates of Hell will be given to eat.\nThe word ghussah literally denotes 'a thing by which one is choked'. For example, a morsel may block the throat in such a way as it can neither be swallowed nor can it be brought up. The inmates of Hell will be given Bari` and zaqqum (thorny fruits) to eat. These fruits fit the description.\nSayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ said: \"In it will be thorns of fire that will\nchoke.\" [ God save us!].",
