  "text": "کمَا قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْ‌يَمَ لِلْحَوَارِ‌يِّينَ مَنْ أَنصَارِ‌ي إِلَى اللَّـهِ (...just as ` Isa, son of Maryam, said to the Disciples, \"Who are my supporters towards Allah?\" ...[ 61:14] \" The word حَوَارِ‌يُّونَ hawariyyin is the plural of hawariyy which connotes a 'sincere friend who is free from any kind of adulteration' [ Ruh-ul-Ma’ ani, referring to Azhari ]. This is the reason why people who believed in Prophet Jesus (علیہ السلام) are called hawariyy. They were twelve in number, as is already discussed in Surah 'Al-` Imran. This verse refers to an incident of Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) and urges the Muslims to gird up their loins to unselfishly help and support the religion of Allah, as when Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was hurt by the enemies, he asked his disciples مَنْ أَنصَارِ‌ي إِلَى اللَّـهِ \"Who are my supporters towards Allah?\"...[ 14] In other words, 'who will help and support me in propagating the religion of Allah?' Twelve people volunteered and pledged to his loyalty and helped him in preaching the religion. Following this example, the Muslims ought to help and support Allah's religion. The blessed Companions of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ followed this example to the fullest extent, and acted upon this command to the highest degree, so much so that the example of the Holy Prophets' Companions stands unparalleled in the history of other ummahs. They helped the Holy Prophet ﷺ and, in the process, incurred the wrath and enmity of Arab and non-Arab communities for the sake of Allah's religion. They bore their tortures and persecution. They dedicated their lives, wealth and children to the cause. Eventually, Allah granted them help and victory. He granted them triumph and mastery of the world, and the territories of the enemies fell into their hands.\nThree Groups of Christians\nفَآمَنَت طَّائِفَةٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَ‌ائِيلَ وَكَفَرَ‌ت طَّائِفَةٌ ۖ فَأَيَّدْنَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا عَلَىٰ عَدُوِّهِمْ فَأَصْبَحُوا ظَاهِرِ‌ينَ (So, a group from the children of Isra'il believed, and another group disbelieved. Then We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became victorious...61:14)\nBaghawi interprets this verse in the light of a narration of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that when Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was raised to the heaven, his followers disagreed and became three groups. A group claimed that He was Himself God who went back to the heaven. The second group claimed that He Himself was not God, but God's son. God lifted him up and salvaged him from the enemies and granted him superiority. The third group proclaimed the truth and said that he was neither god nor the son of god, but he was Allah's servant and His Messenger. Allah took him away to the heaven to protect him from the enemies, and to raise his status. These people were the true believers. Different sectors of the general public attached themselves to each one of these groups. The groups clashed with one another. The two of the non-believing groups overpowered the third group, which was a group of true believers. Eventually, Allah raised the Final Messenger of Allah ﷺ who supported the group of the true believers. This group thus dominated the others because of their correct belief and its solid proofs confirmed by the Qur'an. [ Mazhari ]\nIn this interpretation, the phrase الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا \"those who believed [ 14] \" would refer to the believers of the Ummah of the Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) who would triumph against the unbelievers with the help and support of the Final Messenger ﷺ . [ Mazhari ]. Some scholars hold that when Prophet Isa (علیہ السلام) was raised to the heaven, his followers were divided into two groups. One of them believed that he was God or God's son and thus they became polytheists. The other group believed that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger, and thus they stuck to the right religion. Then there was a war between the believers and the unbelievers. Allah granted victory to the believing faction of Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) against the unbelieving faction. But it is popularly understood that in the religion of Prophet ` Isa (علیہ السلام) the institution of jihad did not exist. Therefore, it is inconceivable that believers would have waged a war. [ Ruh-ul-Ma’ ani ]. However, it is possible that the unbelieving Christians might have started the war and the believing Christians were forced to defend themselves. This will not fall under the category of war.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah As-Saff\nEnds here",
