The Arabs loved that their drink should be mixed with ginger. Therefore, it is mentioned in the context of Paradise [ so that they are served with drinks flavoured with ginger of paradisiacal quality and splendour ]. Some scholars say that the only thing the blessings of Paradise and the blessings of this world share in common is their name, and they have nothing else in common. Therefore, the 'ginger' of this world cannot be equated with the 'ginger' of Paradise.",
