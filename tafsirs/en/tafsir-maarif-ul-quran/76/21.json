  "text": "وَّحُلُّوْٓا اَسَاوِرَ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ ۚ (...And they will be adorned by bracelets of silver...76:21). The asawir is the plural of siwar that refers to a 'bracelet'. It is a piece of jewellery worn around the wrist. This verse speaks of'silver bracelets'. On another occasion [ 22:23], the Qur'an speaks of asawira min dhahab 'gold bracelets'. There is no discrepancy between the two verses, because sometimes the silver bracelets will be worn, and at other times the gold bracelets, or some will wear gold bracelets and others will wear silver bracelets.\nHowever, a question arises in any case: A bracelet looks good on women, but does not suit men. Why will the men of Paradise wear bracelets? The Answer is that suitability of any piece of jewellery to men or women depends on custom. The style and appeal of jewellery differ from country to country and vary from nation to nation. In some cultures, a piece of jewellery is treated as highly inappropriate for men, and in other cultures it is regarded as highly beautiful and elegant. The Chosros [ Persian kings ] used to wear bracelets around their wrists, and various kinds of jewellery used to be studded on their chest and crown. This was counted as a distinctive feature of their prestige and honour. After the conquest of Persian empire, the treasures that fell into Muslims' hands contained the Persian Emperor's bracelets. Thus the various cultures and nations differ in their taste for jewellery in this very world. The flair and taste for jewellery for men in Paradise cannot be equated with their flair for it in this world.",
