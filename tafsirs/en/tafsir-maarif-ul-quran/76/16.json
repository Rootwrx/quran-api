Thus silver and glass are two contradictory concepts in this world. However, it is a characteristic of Paradise that its glasses will be as bright as silver, and as transparent and sparkling as crystal.\nSayyidna Ibn ` Abbas said: The blessings given in Paradise have their likes in this world also, except these vessels that are made of silver, but as transparent as a mirror.\"",
