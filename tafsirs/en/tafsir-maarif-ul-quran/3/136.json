  "text": "Upto this point, the text describes qualities of character that relate to the fulfillment of human rights. Following this, come qualities that relate to the rights of Allah where it has been said that true Muslims do not disobey Allah. Should they ever fall in sin under the compulsions of human weakness, they immediately turn to Allah, repent, seek His forgiveness and resolve to abstain from that sin in future.\nThis character of true Muslims appears in the text in the following words:\nوَالَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُ‌وا اللَّـهَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُ‌وا لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَن يَغْفِرُ‌ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا اللَّـهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّ‌وا عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلُوا وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿135﴾\n...and those who, when they happen to commit a shameful act or wrong themselves, remember Allah, then, seek forgiveness for their sins - and who is there to forgive sins except Allah? - and they do not persist in what they have done, knowingly.(135)\nThe verse tells us that involvement in sin is caused by one's negligence in remembering Allah. So, the instruction is: If a sin has been committed, one should immediately turn to Allah, renew the zeal to obey Him and start remembering Him as He should be remembered.\nAnother point of guidance here tells us that forgiveness of sins depends on two things:\n1.\tTo regret past sins, seek pardon for these and to pray for forgiveness.\n2.\tTo resolve fully not to go near them in future.\nMay Allah Almighty bestow upon us the good fortune to become possessed with these supreme morals identified by the Holy Qur'an. Aamin.",
