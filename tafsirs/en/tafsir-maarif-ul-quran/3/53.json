  "text": "Following blessed predictions mentioned earlier, Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was born with all promised signs. As a messenger sent to Bani Isra` il, he presented his call to them supported by miracles to prove his prophethood. But, the Bani Isra'il were adamant and kept on rejecting him as a prophet, even going to the limit of being physically hostile to him.\nThe text now identifies the very first followers of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) brings to light their real creed, expressed first before their prophet and then (in verse 53), reiterated it in the form of a prayer before their Lord.\nCommentary\nThe word, حواری 'hawariyy (singular of حواریون 'al-hawariyyun' ) appearing in verse 52 (translated as the disciples' ), is a derivation from حوار hawar which lexically means whiteness. In the religious terminology, the title of حواری 'Ihawariyy' has been given to the sincere disciples or companions of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) r either because of their sincerity or the purity of their heart, or because of their white dress. Likewise, the Companions of the Holy Prophet (علیہ السلام) have been called, صاحبی sahabiyy (plural, sahabah).\nSome commentators have given the number of the disciples as twelve. Incidentally, the word 'hawariyy' is also, at times, used in the absolute sense of 'helper' or 'supporter'. It is in this very sense that it was said in a hadth: \"Every prophet has a hawariyy, that is, a sincere companion; Zubair is my hawariyy' (Tafsir al-Qurtubi)\nAn Important Note:\nVerse 52 states that Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) looked for helpers in the way of Allah only when he sensed hostility from disbelievers, and not at the initial stage of his call. As obvious, he had risen to the task all alone obeying the command of his Lord without worrying about setting up a 'party' in advance. When came the need, he found a group around him. A little thought here would show that every worthy mission demands such determination and courage.",
