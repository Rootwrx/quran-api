In the present verse, it has been further emphasised that these are the very reasons why Allah Almighty has conferred upon the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ ، may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, the status of خیر الامم 'Khayr al-Umam', the best of communities, dignified and elevated, when it does what it has been charged to do.\nWhy the best of communities?\nThe Holy Qur'an has, in different verses, given several reason for declaring the Ummah of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as the best Ummah, the most important of which has appeared in Surah al-Baqarah, that is:\nوَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا\nAnd in the same way We made you a moderate Ummah (community). (2:143)\nA detailed explanation of this verse can be seen in Volume I of this commentary. This portion deals with the major reason why the Ummah of Muhammad i has been called the best of human communities. There it has been pointed out that moderation is its great characteristic and that it is visible in all department of its collective life.\nIn this particular verse, another reason has been given. The reason is that this community has been raised for the sole purpose of dispensing good to all beings created by Allah. It has been actually charged with the function of remaining concerned with their spiritual and moral reformation. Seen in the perspective of past communities, it was this community which contributed most in the mission of 'bidding the Fair and forbidding the Unfair', even though this was already enjoined upon past communities as mentioned in authentic ahadith. However, to begin with, several past communities did not have Jihad as a religious obligation, in which case, the mission of 'bidding the Fair' could only be carried out by heart and tongue only. Available with the followers of Muhammad ﷺ is a third option of 'bidding the Fair', that of the power of the hand, which also includes all sorts of Jihad. Then, the enforcement of Islamic laws through the agency of the government is also a part of it. In the case of other communities, distinguishing features of religion were gradually obliterated by general inertia. The obligation of أْمرْ بِالْمَعْرُ‌وف amr bi l'ma` ruf, the ordained mission of bidding the Fair, also stood totally forsaken. As far as this Ummah of his is concerned, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ made this prophecy:\nIn this Ummah, there shall be right through the day of Doom, a group of people which will remain firm and stick to (the task of) bidding the Fair and forbidding the Unfair.\nThe second distinguishing feature of this community is that they 'believe in Allah' يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّـهِ ' At this point one may ask why should this be a distinguishing feature of the Muslim community as belief in Allah has been the common factor between all past prophets (علیہم السلام) and their communities. The answer is clear. No doubt, belief as such is common to all, but the degrees of perfection in belief differ. The degree of pref-erence given to the community of Muhammad ﷺ has a class of its own as compared to past communities.\nTowards the end of the verse, it has been said about the people of the Book that there are some Muslims among them. This refers to those who had confirmed the prophethood of our Holy Prophet ﷺ such as, Sayyidna ` Abdullah ibn Sal-am ؓ and others.",
