  "text": "Commentary\n1.\tThe expression, کَلِمَۃ اللہ 'a word of Allah' refers to Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہ السلام) . This term is used for him because he was created, in an unusual manner, simply by the will and command of Allah - without a paternal linkage.\n2.\tThe second quality of Sayyidna Yahya (علیہ السلام) has been described by the word, حَصُورً 'hasur' translated here as 'abstinent'. It means that he was very particular about keeping himself shielded from temptations, that is, from things one habitually enjoys. When we say one abstains from enjoyments of life, the statement includes abstinence even from fulfilling the desires of things allowed, for example, good food, good dress and marital life and things like these. Since the quality of abstinence has been mentioned here in a positive frame of reference, it obviously seems to suggest that this is the better way, although ahadith prove the higher merit of living in the bond of marriage. In this situation, the considered opinion is that one whose condition is similar to that of Sayyidna Yahya (علیہ السلام) and who is so absorbed in the thought of his life-to-come that he feels no need to have a wife nor has the time and frame of mind to fulfil the rights of his wife and children, then, for such a person this is the better choice. It is because of this particular reason that ahadith which describe the merit of marriage come up with a restrictive clause as well, that is, مَنِ استطاع منکم الباءَۃ which means that one who can marry and is capable of fulfilling the due rights of his wife, should marry, for this is better for him; otherwise, he is not ad-vised to marry.
