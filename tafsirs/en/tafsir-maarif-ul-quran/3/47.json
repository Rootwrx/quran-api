  "text": "The glad tidings given by the angel (verse 46) regarding the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa without a father surprised Sayyidah Maryam as she was a virgin. She wondered how it would happen. Would that be a Divine miracle or would she be asked to marry a man? The Divine answer eliminates the latter possibility. Not restricted by it, 'Allah creates what He wills', that is, His will is all sufficient to bring some-thing into existence. He needs no medium or cause. It is only His command \"be\" which makes things come into existence.",
