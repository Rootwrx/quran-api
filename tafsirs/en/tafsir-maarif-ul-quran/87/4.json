This is the land that has grass growing on it, and that is used for animals to graze. The word ghutha' غُثَا refers to 'stubble, and scum borne upon the surface of a torrent'. The word أَحْوَىٰ ahwa is derived from the root huwwah which refers to 'a kind of black colour that comes upon a dense vegetation'. The verse purports to depict the Divine power and wisdom related to herbage and vegetation. He grows the green vegetation and then He gradually turns it into black colour, and it loses its freshness. This directs man's attention also to his end. His body radiating with health, beauty, smartness and alertness is a Divine gift, but its tenure of life is limited. Eventually it will come to an end.",
