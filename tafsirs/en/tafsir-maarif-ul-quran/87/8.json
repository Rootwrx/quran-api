  "text": "وَنُيَسِّرُكَ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ (And We will facilitate for you [ to reach ] the easiest way....87:8). The phrase the easiest way' refers to the sacred laws of Islam. Apparently, according to the demand of the context, it should have been stated 'We will make the Shari'ah easy for you'. But the Qur'an chose, instead, to state 'And We will facilitate for you (to reach) the easiest way. [ 8] '. The reason for that, probably, is to indicate that Allah will predispose him to the sacred laws, so that they will become part of his nature, and he will become an embodiment of Shari'ah.",
