  "text": "مِّن وَرَ‌ائِهِمْ جَهَنَّمُ \"In front of them, there is Jahannam...45:10\" The word وَرَ‌اءِ war' in Arabic is mostly used in the sense of \"behind\" and occasionally used in the sense of \"front\". Most commentators have taken the word in this context to mean ` front' and we have translated it accordingly. However, some of the commentators have taken it in this context to mean ` back/behind' and interpreted it to mean that those who are living in haughtiness and arrogance, the fire of Hell is trailing behind/after them.
