Under this subject-matter, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ is consoled for the persecution carried out by the enemies against him.\nإِنَّ رَ‌بَّكَ يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُمْ (\"...Surely your Lord will judge between them, on the Day of Judgment, in the matters in which they used to differ... 45:17) \" This far the verses confirm two points: This verse purports to say, firstly, that the Book of Musa (علیہ السلام) contains many clear prophecies about the advent of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and, secondly to comfort the Holy Prophet ﷺ that the Israelites rejected him not because there was any dearth of arguments, signs and Divine prophecies to support and establish his claim, but because of jealousy, love of the world and personal desires, that is, they did not like the very idea that the Final Messenger ﷺ should have appeared from among the non-Israelites . (Bayan-ul-Qur’ an).",
