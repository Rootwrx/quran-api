When the division of the inheritance is attended by those who are [to be] the possessors of its shares and are the legal heirs and others [also] attend who have no [legal] portion and who are poor do not deprive them of that. If the legal heir is a minor make to [the poor] a goodly promise saying to them \ufffdWhen the child grows up we will tell him to give you something.\ufffd This is the meaning of His words and speak to them honorable words. In this is a subtle allusion to those who have sinned. When they are present at His court in the future and the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd pardons those who were obedient and gives them the rewards for their deeds He will not deprive the poor Muslims18 among you of the pardon if God wills after their having been among the family of faith ahl al-īmān. Similarly you were not present on the day of the division19-you have no prior entitlement. In what you know of [God] He has made you deserving ahhala20 by His favor in spite of His knowledge of the lapses that will occur in your states."
