  "text": "And do not marry women whom your fathers married unless it be a thing of the past; surely that is obscene and abominable an evil way. This verse alludes to the protection of honor and staying within the limits of respect. If it is natural for a man to hate that another should bed his wife then sons should be forbidden from disregarding the rights of their fathers in seeking to bed their [fathers'] wives."
