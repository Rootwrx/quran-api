Give tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful chastisement. Those whose states have alternated so that they rise and fall then rise up again and then stumble -He has sealed their states in their unseemliness. The arrows of divine power have struck them by decree and the misery of fate has caught up with them as their final state. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd will not guide them to a purpose nor lead them to good sense. \ufffdGive tidings to them of separation without end fa-bashshirhum bi-l-furqati al-abadiyya and tell them of punishment uninterrupted wa-akhbirhum bi-l-ʿuqūbati al-sarmadiyya.\ufffd"
