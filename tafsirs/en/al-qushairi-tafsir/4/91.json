  "text": "You will find others desiring to have security from you and security from their own people; yet whenever they are returned to sedition they are overwhelmed by it. So if they do not stay away from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands then take them and slay them wherever you come upon them; against them We have given you clear warrant. The effort of anyone who desires to combine two opposing things is ruined and his resolve does not grow. Just as an individual cannot be both a hypo- crite and one who wholeheartedly submits muslim no individual can be desirous of the Real and remain with the precepts of the people of habit. Spiritual desire irāda and habit ʿāda are opposites. It is necessary to abandon contradictory stances and to distance yourself from that which has no relation to you."
