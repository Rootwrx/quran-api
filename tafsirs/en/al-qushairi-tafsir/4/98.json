As for such perhaps God will pardon them for God is ever Pardoning Forgiving. This alludes to those who are overwhelmed and annihilated by meanings maʿānī and then continue on as those who act on His behalf.97 They do not have power or strength [of their own] and what appears to them are [the decrees] He \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd causes to flow over them. After the return of their selves through the reality of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq they are effaced from themselves and are not guided to anything other than Him as a way and do not take so much as a breath for anything other than Him. In accordance with the outward aspect of the verse it is said that per- haps the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd will grant His pardon to those whose excuses held them back from choosing [to emigrate]."
