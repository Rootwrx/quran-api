  "text": "And whoever slays a believer deliberately his requital is hell abiding therein and God's wrath is with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement. Just as the slaying of another [human being] has been prohibited to you so is slaying yourself: whoever follows his whims sets out to shed his own blood. Whoever does not give good counsel and admonition to an aspirant and does not assist him in his resolve is endeavoring to shed [the aspirant's] blood. Such a person is held captive to his own state-it is fitting that the consequence to him should be an unpleasant one for he should not enjoy [the states] from which he has held aspirants back. [God] \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said \ufffdO David when you see someone seeking me become a servant to him.\ufffd"
