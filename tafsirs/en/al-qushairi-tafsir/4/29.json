And whoever does that through aggression and injustice him We shall certainly expose to a fire; and that for God is an easy matter. Every thing spent for something other than God is capital spent for nothing. It is said that [this refers] to withholding in a heedless way and expend- ing from a place other than that of bearing witness to the true reality ḥaqīqa. All of that comes to nothing. And kill not yourselves that is by committing sins. It is said that it is an indirect reference to those things that would incur His wrath \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. It is said [kill not yourselves] by looking to and paying mind to [your lower selves]. It is said [kill not yourselves] by being pleased with [your lower selves] or giving preference to them over the good pleasure of the Real. And whoever does that through aggression and injustice We will not spare him from a fierce punishment. We will entrust [the fire] with its rightful inhabitant nakilahā ilā ṣāḥibihā and give it free rein wa-nalqā ḥablahā ʿalā ghāribihā."
