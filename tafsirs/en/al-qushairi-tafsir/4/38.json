These are also included in His words \ufffdsurely God loves not the conceited and the boastful fakh큰r\ufffd [4:36]. Their immediate punishment is that they are not in the group of those whom He loves. That is tribulation enough. The conceited are those who look to themselves while those who show off look to others like them. Both of them are branded by hidden idolatry shirk khaf카 and God does not love those who associate others with Him. Among camels the fakh큰r is a she-camel in the flock whose teats are blocked so that a large amount of milk collects in the udder. The buyer thinks that that is normal for her but it is not so. Likewise anyone who looks only to himself and his standing in the present moment is making false claims-he is fakh큰r and God does not love him. This is also the case for the one who expends his substance to show off to people."
