When they attached their hearts to what is transitory in this world He reminded them of what happens in the hereafter saying \ufffdthen God has the reward of this world and of the hereafter.\ufffd This was to inform them that the blessing of the hereafter is far above what they aspire to in this paltry place. When the object of their search was elevated to the hereafter He cut them off from any external or created thing [saying] \ufffdAnd God is better and more enduring\ufffd [20:73]."
