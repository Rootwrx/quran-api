  "text": "The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant of God neither would the angels who are nigh. Whoever disdains to worship Him and waxes proud He will assuredly muster them to Him all of them. As for those who believed who did righteous deeds He will pay them their wages in full and He will give them more of His bounty; How can they disdain the worship of Him when one's honor and dignity sharaf [comes] through worshipḍ How can they be too proud to humble themselves when one's ruin talaf [comes] from being too proudḍ Because of this matter the first words the Messiah spoke were Lo! I am God's servant [19:30]. Servants become beautiful in their humility toward [their] masters. This is something well known and without doubt. [The phrase] neither would the angels who are nigh does not imply that [the angels] are superior to the Messiah. Rather [God] was addressing them in accordance with their beliefs-they believed in the superiority of the angels over human beings.and as for those who disdain and are too proud He will chastise them with a painful chastisement and they shall not find for themselves besides God any friend or helper. The painful chastisement is that they will never attain to the communion [of lovers] after they have come to know His majesty. When what they know becomes indisputable they will know that they have been left behind. Their sorrow on that day for what has slipped away from them will be their most intense punishment."
