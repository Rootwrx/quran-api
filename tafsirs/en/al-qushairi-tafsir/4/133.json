One who is able to do without others in all eternity without beginning man istaghnā ʿanhu fī āzālihi has no need for them in all eternity without end fa-lā ḥājatin lahu ilayhi fī ābādihi. It is said that He has no need for any- one while the servant is unable to do without Him for even a single breath. It is said that there is no limit to the things which are decreed so that if it were not ʿAmr then it would be Zayd. If it were not a servant it would be servants. The only one for whom there is no substitute or replacement is the One the Unique."
