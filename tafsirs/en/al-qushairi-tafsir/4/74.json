The struggle jihād of someone who has not slain the lower self in himself is not sound. The removal of the fear of death from the heart comes first and then the surrender of the lower self to it. We shall give him a great wage means \ufffdOur remaining after him is better for him than his life through his lower self.\ufffd Their speaker said: Are you not my compensation for myselfḍ That is honor enough. Besides you I have no goal nor anything to request."
