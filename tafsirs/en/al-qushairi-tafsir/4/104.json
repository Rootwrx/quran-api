Stand up for God and let your trust be in God in your struggle jihƒÅd. If you are suffering they are also suffering: The enemy shares with you the experience of suffering but they are different from you in the witness- ing of the heart for you witness what they do not witness and you find in your hearts what they do not find. So it is unseemly for you to lag behind them in effort and struggle."
