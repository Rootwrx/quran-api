And pray for forgiveness from God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. \ufffdWe did not command you to judge between them blindly but rather by that which God has shown you that is by that which He unveiled to you from the lights of insight until you understood it by Our teaching you and Our directing you. This is also the case with those from your community who judge with the truth.\ufffd And do not be a disputant for traitors: that is do not defend the masters of worldly concerns arbāb al-ḥuẓūẓ but rather be with the children of [God's] rights abnāÌ al-ḥuqūq. Whoever turns to their whim is a trai- tor to the fear of God taqwā entrusted to his soul. Whoever trusts the inclinations of lower desires is a traitor to the shame ḥayāÌ100 required of him before the eyes of the Protector. \ufffdAnd pray for forgiveness from God for your community for surely We suffice for you in Our saying 'that God may forgive you what is past of your sin'\ufffd [48:2]."
