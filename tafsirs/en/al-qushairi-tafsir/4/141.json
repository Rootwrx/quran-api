  "text": "Those who wait in watch for you and if a victory comes to you from God say \ufffdWere we not with youḍ\ufffd; but if the disbelievers have some luck they say \ufffddid we not gain mastery over you and did we not defend you against the believersḍ\ufffd God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection and God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers. Because they lacked sincerity ikhlāṣ in the truest sense and had not tasted true conviction ʿaqīda they showed themselves to be of a different char- acter from those who in the [divine] decree submitted. [Those who sub- mitted] and the disbelievers are not the same. It is necessary for the people of the Real to be wary of [the disbelievers] and to stay aloof from them. Then He \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd included a beautiful expression of His sufficiency for them by His saying \ufffdGod will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers\ufffd which is an all-encompassing statement. Surely the evil of their deception is diverted back to them fa-inna wabāla kaydihim ilayhim maṣrūfun and the requital for their plotting is reserved for them wa-jazāÌa makrihim ʿalayhim mawqūfun. The right and true reality-its people are aided from the power of the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd wa-l-ḥaqqu min qibali al-ḥaqqi subḥānihi manṣūrun ahluhu. The false-its foundation is uprooted through the help of the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd wa-l-bāṬilu bi-naṣri al-ḥaqqi subḥānihi mujtaththun aṣluhu."
