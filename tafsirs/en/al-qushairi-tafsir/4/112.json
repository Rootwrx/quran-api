Whoever attributes his own disgraceful acts to an innocent person-God turns the tables on him by clothing the innocent one with the robe of the good deeds of his accuser and by pulling the garment of pardon over his bad deeds. And He reverses the situation for the aggressor by exposing his behaviors to his peers."
