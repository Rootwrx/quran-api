He gave you power over this world but then said \ufffdThe enjoyment of this world is trifling\ufffd so it is of no account for you. If you were to give alms from it so much as half a date you would be saved from the fire and reach the garden. This is the most extraordinary generosity. Caring little about what comes to you-because of your beloved-is the strongest indicator of your relationship. It is said that when He wants you to forsake the present world He makes it seem meager in your eyes so that abandoning it will be easy for you. It is said: Say \ufffdThe enjoyment of this world-the sum total of it-is trifling. Since your portion is less than [this] trifling [amount] why would He quarrel with you over the details of what is permitted taḥlīl so long as your pact remains secure from alteration tabdīlḍ If the value of this world is trifling then the cheapest of the cheap are those who are content with the cheap khasīs in lieu of the precious nafīs. The believer is torn from the worlds of being kawn in degrees. First He said \ufffdsay 'The enjoyment of this world is trifling; and the hereafter is better'\ufffd-He seizes them from the present world by what comes next. Then He robs them of both worlds saying But what is with God is better and more lasting [42:36]."
