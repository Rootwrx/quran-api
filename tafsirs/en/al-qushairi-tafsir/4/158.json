  "text": "And for their saying \ufffdWe slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God.\ufffd And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but he was given the resemblance. And those who disagree concerning him are surely in doubt regarding him. They do not have any knowledge of him only the pursuit of conjecture; and they did not slay him for certain. Nay God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty Wise. It is said that God caused the one who slandered [Jesus] to resemble him and he was killed and crucified in his place. There is a saying that one who digs a grave for his brother falls into it. It is [also] said that Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said \ufffdWhoever agrees to have my resem- blance cast upon him so that he is killed in place of me will have the garden\ufffd and one of his companions agreed. It is said that because [this companion] patiently bore the injury talaf he was not deprived of the recompense khalaf from God. God most high said \ufffdIndeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste\ufffd [18:30]. It is said that because this man who was a companion of Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd was without any imperfection in his lower self nafs he became [Jesus's] friend in spirit rūḥ. When Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd was raised up to the place of intimacy maḥall al-zulfa the spirit of this one who ransomed [Jesus] with his lower self was raised up to the place of nearness maḥall al-qurba."
