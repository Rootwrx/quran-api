Whoever loves to meet God God loves to meet him. It is said that since death is inevitable submitting to His decree willingly is better than tolerating it unwillingly. Moreover He told them that because of the weakness of their facul- ties of insight and the infirmity of their beliefs they are joyful and show gratitude when a good thing befalls them. But if an evil thing befalls them they are not guided to God. The Magian disposition flows in them so that they attribute aḌāfū [the evil thing] to something that is created. [God] replied to them saying \ufffdsay to them O Muḥammad 'Everything is from God through [the acts of] creating and originating producing and invent- ing decreeing and facilitating.'\ufffd"
