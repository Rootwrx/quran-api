  "text": "But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds him He will admit to a fire abiding therein and for him there shall be a humbling chastisement. There are indeed two punishments one immediate and one postponed and ignominy unites the two of them. If created beings were to attempt to debase those who are disobedient with the like of the debasement that has already come to them through their disobedience they would not be able to do it. Because of this their speaker said \ufffdWhoever spends the night committing a sin wakes up with his degradation wa-ʿalayhi madhallatuhu. But one says of one who wakes up and passes the day performing pious acts that he has his dignity wa-ʿalayhi mahābatuhu.\ufffd"
