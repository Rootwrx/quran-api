  "text": "Surely those who disbelieve in Our signs-We shall expose them to a fire; as often as their skins are consumed We shall replace them with other skins that they may taste the chastisement. Surely God is ever Mighty Wise. This alludes to those who deny the signs of the friends. He causes them to remain in a state of insignificance yuqīmuhum bi-waṣfi al-ṣighār and leaves them to the estrangement of denial wa-yabqiyahum fī waḥshati al-inkār. Whenever something appears to their hearts from this story their rejection leads them to abandon faith in it and to dismiss its people with contempt so they are punished over and over again."
