  "text": "And those whom the angels take [in death] while they are wronging their souls the angels will say \ufffdWhat was your predicamentḍ\ufffd They will say \ufffdWe were oppressed in the land.\ufffd The angels will say \ufffdBut was not God's earth spacious that you might have emigrated thereinḍ\ufffd As for such their abode shall be hell-an evil journey's end! This alludes to one whose time comes while he is still trapped in his lower self and enslaved to his desires-there is no excuse for him since he did not emigrate to the protection of His nearness so that he could be saved from the contemptible nature of his lower self. There is no veil between you and this talk except your whims."
