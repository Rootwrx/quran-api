  "text": "Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers and say \ufffdWe believe in some and disbelieve in some\ufffd and seek to adopt a way between them. Those are the disbelievers truly; and We have prepared for the disbe- lievers a humiliating chastisement. [God] relates that they have added the blameworthy actions enumerated here to the shamefulness of their disbelief. He explains that He has doubled their chastisement as requital for their sin so that you will know that He is ever on the watch [89:14] over those who act in corrupt and harmful ways."
