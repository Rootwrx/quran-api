  "text": "When you are among them and you stand to lead them in prayer let a party of them stand with you and let them take their weapons. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them be behind you and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons. The disbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons. But take your precautions; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement. This verse indicates that [the obligation of] prayer is not lifted from the servant so long as there is a breath remaining in him to choose. Not in fear or in security not when you are in a state of separation where the precepts of the law predominate or when overwhelmed by the authority of reality sulṬān al-ḥaqīqa when you are at the source of gathering together ʿayn al-jamʿ."
