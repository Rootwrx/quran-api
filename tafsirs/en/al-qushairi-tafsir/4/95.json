  "text": "The believers who sit at home other than those who have an injury are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home by a degree; yet to each God has promised the goodly reward and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home with a great reward degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy. Surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd has gathered together all of His friends in His favors but He distinguishes between them in degrees. Whether one is rich or a servant there is one richer than him. With one who is great there is one greater than him. The stars glisten but the moon is above them and when the sun appears it outshines all by its light."
