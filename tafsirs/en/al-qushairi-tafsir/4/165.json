  "text": "messengers bearing good tidings and warning so that people might have no argument against God after the messengers. God is ever Mighty Wise. He informed created beings of the measure of [the messengers'] worth. He explained that He sent the messengers to them and that they should look to them alone for the gathering of their reward and to avoid what would make them deserving of punishment. [He explained] that created beings have no [other] way to the comfort they seek or the hurt they wish to avoid in the present or in the end. So that people might have no argument against God after the mes- sengers. God is ever Mighty Wise: How could one who has need ḥāja of God have an argument ḥujja against Godḍ But God addressed them in accordance with their understandings."
