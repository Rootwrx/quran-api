The more signs were given to them outwardly the more denial and rejec- tion there was in their hearts. Receiving more communications did not benefit them since the eyes of their hearts were not open to witnessing [these communications]. God most high said \ufffdBut signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe\ufffd [10:101]."
