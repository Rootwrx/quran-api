Fight therefore against the friends of Satan; surely the plotting of Satan is ever feeble. Those who are sincerely devoted to God do not prefer anything to God and they do not hold anything back from God. They are ever against their lower selves for the sake of God. The states of those who disbelieve are the reverse of [those of] the believers. Therefore He strengthened and encouraged [the believers] saying Fight therefore against the friends of Satan that is \ufffddo not feel any fear toward them for I am taking care of your affairs and will suffice for you against your enemies.\ufffd"
