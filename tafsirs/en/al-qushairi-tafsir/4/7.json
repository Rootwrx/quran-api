The determining of inheritance does not vary according to virtue or good qualities nor is it different due to fault defect or sin. If a man dies leav- ing two sons their rights are equivalent even if one of them is pious and God-fearing and the other wicked and disobedient. The God-fearing one does not get more because of his fear of God and the wicked one does not get less because of his wickedness. The deeper meaning in this is that inheritance is a gift from God that comes before [any action or virtue] so it is shared equally by the pious and the wicked. Likewise the determining of faith is a gift that comes before [any action or virtue] for Muslims. God most high said \ufffdThen We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose [35:32]. Then He said Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves and some of them are moderate and some are those who take the lead in [performing] good works by the leave of God. That is the greatest favor!\ufffd [35:32]."
