So turn away from them rely on God and God suffices as a Guardian. This means that \ufffdwhen they come to you [Muḥammad] they surrender to your witnessing mushāhada but when they leave the light of your approach iqbāl is cut off and they return to darknesses\ufffd just as they say: Whenever he repents he returns to his ignorance just as the one who is feeble suffers a relapse."
