  "text": "It is not your desires nor the desires of the people of the scripture. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it; and he will not find besides God any friend or helper. And whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female and is a believer-such shall be admitted into paradise and not be wronged the dint in a date-stone. Whoever plants colocynth will not harvest roses and jasmine. Whoever drinks deadly poison will not find the taste of honey. Likewise whoever squanders the duty of service will not become firmly established on the carpet of nearness. Whoever is branded with misfortune wa-man wusima bi-l-shiqwati will not be provided with the best of the best lam yurzaq al-ṣafwati. Whomever the divine decree rejects wa-man nafathu al-qaḌiyyati there is no helper for him in creation fa-lā nāṣira lahu min al-bariyyati. And whoever does righteous deeds... \ufffdWhoever labors in Our service khidma will not be kept from attaining Our blessing niʿma. Indeed whomever We have made rich in seeking Us We honor him in finding Us. Whomever We have made to drink from the cup of longing for Us We bring him to the intimacy of meeting Us.\ufffd"
