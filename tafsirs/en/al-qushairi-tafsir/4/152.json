  "text": "And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them those-We shall surely give them their wages. God is ever Forgiving Merciful. When they believed in all of the messengers and confirmed everything to which they were commanded they deserved acceptance and the beautiful recompense. To let go of one's faith in some individuals is to let go of one's faith in [the messages sent in other] time periods. Just as [God] will not accept the faith of a person whose faith does not include all the messages that have come before him likewise He will not accept the faith of a per- son whose faith does not include all that faith demands of him since [God] made that a condition for its actualization taḥqīq and perfection kamāl. This alludes to the fact that anyone who does not wholeheartedly enter into the covenant will not have so much as a sliver of the reality of com- munion [of lovers]. The Prophet ﷺ said \ufffdThe pilgrimage is [the day of] ʿArafa.\ufffd Anyone who traverses the distance even if he comes from a deep ravine but then holds back even a little from ʿArafāt has not experienced the pilgrimage. The Prophet ﷺ said \ufffdThe servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant to the last dirham.\ufffd"
