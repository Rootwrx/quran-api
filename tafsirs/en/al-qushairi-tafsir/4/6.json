  "text": "Try well the orphans until they reach the age of marrying; then if you perceive in them maturity rushd deliver their property to them; consume it not wastefully and in haste lest they should grow up. If any man is rich let him be abstinent; if he is poor let him consume honorably.  And when you deliver to them their property take witnesses over them. God suffices as a reckoner. To perceive maturity means [to perceive] decency and integrity. It is gen- erosity and the preservation of honor keeping company with elders and striving to look to the good and to perform acts of devotion as decreed by the command. It is said that the one who is mature rashÄ«d is the one who is guided to his Lord. When a need arises in him he does not rely on his own power or strength his own planning or choosing."
