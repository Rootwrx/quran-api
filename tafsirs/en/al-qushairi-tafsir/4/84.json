And urge on the believers; maybe God will restrain the might of the disbelievers; God is mightier and more severe in castigation. \ufffdRise up [Muá¸¥ammad] with Us in surrendering everything from you to Our command. Just as there is no one to compare to you in your rank because of your elevated status over all We likewise do not charge anyone but you with the like of what you have been charged and We do not burden anyone but you with what you have been burdened. This is because of your singular worth among those otherwise like you in outward form.\ufffd"
