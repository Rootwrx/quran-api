  "text": "But do not give to the foolish your property which God has assigned to you as maintenance; provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words. The foolish are those who keep you from the Real and distract you from the Lord. The foolish are those dependents and children who prefer their worldly portions over the rights of God most high. Which God has assigned to you as maintenance: To keep to pleasing actions in the situation is better for you than exposing yourself to disgrace petitioning begging and contriving. For the liberation of the heart it is better to be generous than withholding and [better] to rely on patience. But as for forming the intention to beg or making yourself and your dependents a burden on other people it is more appropriate to hold on to a sufficient amount from what God has assigned to you. Then you can be generous with what is in excess of your needs. Provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words: If you have more than enough to help them today do not with- hold that which you know they need out of fear of future poverty. If your hand is constrained from providing support do not let your tongue loose in speaking ill. It is said that when your lower self calls you to spend in a useless way you are the most foolish of the foolish so do not yield to it."
