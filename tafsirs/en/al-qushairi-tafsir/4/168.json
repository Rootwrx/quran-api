  "text": "Surely those who disbelieve and bar [people] from the way of God they have indeed gone far astray. Surely those who disbelieve and who have done wrong it is not for God to forgive them neither to guide them to any path except for the path of hell abiding therein forever; and for God that is an easy matter. He made their barring believers from following the truth the equivalent of their disbelief in God. [In equating these two] God most high treats the rights of His friends as seriously as He treats His own right. Then He said surely those who disbelieve and who have done wrong. He made their wrongdoing áº“ulm the same as their disbelief kufr and attached to both of these the justly deserved abiding punishment. Even if wrongdoing is not like disbelief in deserving the threat of endless duration the misfortune of it is that God may abandon those who do it until they succumb to disbelief."
