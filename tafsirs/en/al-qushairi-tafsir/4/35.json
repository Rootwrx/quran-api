Surely God is ever Knower Aware. It is said that you have the right to her obedience in terms of the body but as for love and inclination toward you in the heart that is up to God. So do not burden her with what God has not provided for you from her. Hearts are in the power of God and He causes love within them toward whom He will and makes them hate whom He will. It is said that if they then obey you do not seek a way against them that is do not forget her loyalty in the past because of a single incident of antipa- thy in the present for perhaps the situation will become amicable again."
