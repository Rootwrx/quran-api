  "text": "God-there is no god except Him He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. And who is truer in state- ment than God·∏ç This address contains both a negation and an affirmation. The negation concerns what is other than God-what is negated is impossible for them. The affirmation belongs to Him through [His] divinity. It is not possible to deny what He has affirmed for Himself."
