  "text": "O you who believe be upright in justice; witnesses for God even though it be against yourselves; or parents and kinsmen whether the person be rich or poor; God is closer to the two. So do not follow any whim lest you swerve for if you twist or refrain surely God is ever aware of what you do. \ufffdJustice\ufffd qisṬ is being fair and equitable ʿadl. \ufffdTo be upright\ufffd for God in being fair and equitable is to uphold His rights against yourself and to seek the same from everyone over whom you have authority. This can be accomplished either through an exhortation to act kindly or a rebuke concerning something despicable admonitions direction to a legal issue or guidance to something that is the right thing to do ḥaqq. The deepest realization of what is right and true taḥqīq will not touch the innermost self of one who holds back what is rightly due ḥaqq to God. The founda- tion of religion is to prefer the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq over the right of created beings ḥaqq al-khalq. Whoever prefers anyone-a father mother child kinsman or relation-to God or holds back any portion due to Him is not upright in justice."
