Consider how they invent falsehood against God and that suffices for a clear sin. Whoever relies on what people say about his purity or seeks the satisfaction of the elite over that of ordinary people is someone who praises himself for purity. Looking to the self is the greatest veil. Whoever imagines that he is purifying himself with litanies or efforts he undertakes by what he does or does not do is veiled by his own ignorance. Consider how they invent... alludes to those who let loose their tongues and claim what they have not actualized. The one who invents in this way does not say anything but that ears reject him and hearts are driven away. Then when he becomes silent he returns to a heart laid waste."
