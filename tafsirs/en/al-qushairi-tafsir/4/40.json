He does not deprive them of anything in their reward but rather is first with his bounty for them without their having deserved [it] and He doubles the wages for their works. It is impossible to describe what [God] has decreed as wrongdoing because the creation is His creation and the kingdom is His kingdom. The wrongdoer is one who transgresses a limit which has been ordained for him-it is impossible to describe the glory of [God's] sublime measure in this way."
