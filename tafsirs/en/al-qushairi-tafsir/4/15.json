  "text": "As for those of your women who commit lewdness call four of you to witness against them; and if they witness then detain them in their houses until death take them or God appoints for them a way. So as to lower the veil of generosity over the sins of servants [God] made allowances through an excessive number of witnesses [required] to estab- lish proof of lewdness which is fornication. To follow the witnessing pro- cedure in the law makes establishing proof of the circumstances nearly impossible. When Māʿiz [ibn Mālik] told [the Prophet] ﷺ \ufffdO Messenger of God may the blessings of God be upon you I have committed fornication\ufffd he said \ufffdMaybe you [only] kissedḍ\ufffd On another occasion [the Prophet] said \ufffdsmell his breath.\ufffd In this there is the strongest proof of what I have mentioned of the lowering of the veil over ugly acts."
