  "text": "They will ask you for a pronouncement. Say: \ufffdGod pronounces to you concerning indirect heirs. If a man perishes having no children but he has a sister hers is half of what he leaves and he is her heir if she has no children. If there be two sisters theirs are two-thirds of what he leaves; if there be siblings men and women then the male shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things.\ufffd He cut short their disputes regarding the apportioning of inheritance by proclaiming the formula determined for them for truly wealth is an object of desire for humankind and the lower selves nufūs are prone to greed. If the appropriate amounts were not decisively determined doubts would arise from the use of independent judgment ijtihād and this would lead to contention and mutual attacks. This summation [of the portions of inheritance] definitively establishes the inheritance amounts for the dispu- tants. His designation of inheritance rights for women-even when their closest relatives do not defend them-shows consideration for their weaker position. [On the other hand] the preference given to males over them is because of the burdens [they have been given] in providing and seeking income and in supporting [women]."
