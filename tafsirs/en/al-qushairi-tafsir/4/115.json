  "text": "But whoever makes a breach with the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers We shall turn him over to what he has turned to and We shall expose him in hell-an evil journey's end. Thoughts khawāṬir that come from the Real are His emissaries to the servant. Whoever opposes the subtle directives ishārāt that are demanded by the inner path brings upon himself the punishments of hearts. Included among these is the blinding of his eyes to the perception of what is right rushd. Just as someone who resists consensus ijmāʿ in the [outer] religion leaves the fold so someone who resists what he recognizes as the truth after the path has become clear to him falls away."
