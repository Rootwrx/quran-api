  "text": "So how shall it be when We bring forward from every community a witness; and We bring you as witness against theseḍ Upon that day the disbelievers those who have disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth might be leveled with them. And they will not hide from God any talk. Since the Messenger ﷺ will be the witness against his community as well as their intercessor he will only bear witness to that which can be the object of [his] intercession. Upon that day the disbelievers... They will become remorseful but it will not benefit them. They will bite their fingertips but their anguish will not subside. They will be wrapped in the veil of ignominy and transferred to the homesteads of tribulation and adversity."
