  "text": "Those are God's bounds. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger He will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; that is the great triumph. His bounds ḥudūd are His commands and prohibitions and that by which His servants ʿibād show their devotion taʿabbada bihi. The root of ser- vanthood ʿubūdiyya is preserving the bounds ḥudūd and maintaining the promises ʿuhūd. Whoever preserves His limit nothing bad or harmful will reach him. The root of every affliction is going beyond the bounds."
