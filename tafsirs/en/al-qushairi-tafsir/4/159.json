  "text": "And there is not one of the people of the scripture but will assuredly believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them. Because He determined that there will be no protection amān granted to them at the time of despair their faith īmān at that time will not benefit them. This tells us that what is taken into consideration [comes from] the protection āmān granted by the Real not from the faith īmān of the servant."
