And whatever good you expend is for yourselves; for then you are expending desiring only God's face and whatever good you expend shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged. \ufffd[O Muḥammad] yours is the praiseworthy station al-maqām al-maḥmūd the firmly tied banner al-liwāÌ al-maʿqūd the noble degrees al-rutab al-sharīfa the high waystations al-manāzil al-ʿaliyya and the pleasing practices al-sunan al-marḌiyya. You are the leader of those who come first and those who come last. No one comes close to you and certainly [no one] equals you. But you are not responsible for their guidance. Guidance is among the special characteristics of Our right and not a sliver of it is given to another. O Muḥammad you call them but We guide them.\ufffd"
