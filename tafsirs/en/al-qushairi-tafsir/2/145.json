If you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you then you will surely be among the evildoers. \ufffdDevotion to the path of the Real was already yours from the eternal decree [just as it was decreed] that your enemies would fall to the side. Between the two of you there is a barrier barzakh. They do not overstep [55:19-20]. They will not follow your qibla even if you were to show them evidence that was clearer than suns and moons. And you will not be followers of their qibla even if they bring every stratagem. In that there is a decree from God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd from pre-eternity.\ufffd"
