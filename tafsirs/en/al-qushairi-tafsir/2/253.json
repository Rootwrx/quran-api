  "text": "Those messengers some We have preferred above others; there are some to whom God spoke and some He raised in rank. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit. In the message they were united but they differed in the specific details. Each one has lights and their lights have places where they are cast. Among them is one who is the most sublime in terms of light and most perfect in rank and intensity. Their virtues are not entitlements based on their actions and states but rather are a goodly decree that came to them ḥukmun bi-l- ḥusnā adrakahum and a beautiful succession that reached them in turns wa-ʿāqibatun bi-l-jamīli tadārakathum. And had God willed those who came after them would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them; but they fell into variance and some of them believed and some disbelieved and had God willed they would not have fought against one another but God does whatever He desires. They are made to turn about by the eternal will and have been stripped of free choice; [instead there is the divine choice] around which everything circles madār and by which is the crossing over iʿtibār. Servanthood is the tight- ening of the belt of service khidma and the witnessing of prior fate qisma."
