  "text": "And when he turns his back he hastens about the earth to do cor- ruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock; and God loves not corruption. [Here] the allusion is to those who only hasten to seek worldly fortunes. They are not concerned even though the ties to their religion have become unraveled and their bonds to Islam have been weakened. After that the ropes [tying them to] the world become stronger and the bonds of their desires become more closely woven with the prohibited things they have gathered and the debris they have acquired. When they retire to their whis- perings and ruinous aims they hasten to corruption make decisions based on worldly [aims] and employ people to help them in furthering their affairs-people from whose hearts God has removed inner sight. And God loves not corruption: Outward corruption is whatever brings about the ruin of religious affairs and the proper ordering of worldly matters."
