The objectives of enemies in all their states fī jamīʿi aḥwālihim including their actions and words min aʿmālihim wa-aqwālihim are malicious for they remain tied to their ways in what they do and do not do. The way of the friends [of God] is to avoid being like them and to adopt a path which is not their path."
