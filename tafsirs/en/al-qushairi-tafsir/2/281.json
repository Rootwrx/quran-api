  "text": "And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged. There are two kinds of return: [a return] for the bodily and lower selves in the future at the time of death and [a return] for the innermost selves and hearts at every breath. [The latter is] a reckoning-a payment in ready cash versus a promise [regarding the future]. The payment in ready cash for His claim [at every breath] is more fitting than what will come at the resurrection by His promise. He said to ordinary people \ufffdAnd fear a day\ufffd and He said to the elect \ufffdand fear Me\ufffd [2:41]."
