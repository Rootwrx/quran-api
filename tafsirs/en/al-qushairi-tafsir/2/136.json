When [God] proclaimed the harmony muwāfaqa of all [the messages of the prophets] He entrusted everything in existence [to fall] under [Muḥammad's] banner. [Muḥammad] said \ufffdAdam and all others shall be under my banner on the Day of the Resurrection.\ufffd When his community believed in everything that God revealed to His messengers and made no division between any of them they drew the highest share in honor and took precedence over all communities."
