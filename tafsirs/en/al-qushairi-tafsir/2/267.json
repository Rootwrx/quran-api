  "text": "O you who believe expend of the good things you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth and seek not the corrupt of it for your expending; for you would never take it yourselves without closing your eyes to it; and know that God is Independent Laudable. Let everyone consider what he expends on his own account and what is produced by the command of his Lord. That which is brought out against you is from your account book dīwān: That which has been designated for your worldly portion are the precious things you possess and that which has been designated for your Lord are the things of little value from your assets. That which is [given by you] for God's sake is but a morsel while that which is [given by God] for your sake is of the utmost value and [is] the most perfect in blessing. Then see how He forgives you and even accepts it from you. Nay look how He compensates you. Nay look how He praises you for it look how he ascribes it to you. Everything from Him is a favor but He ascribes it to you as an act. Therefore His gift is entrusted to you and the gift is called a reward. He expands you by giving you success from [His] kindness. Then [your expansion] spreads out into the world by [His] beneficence."
