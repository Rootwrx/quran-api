God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd wanted to give life to the dead man so that he could expose his killer through the testimony [of the slain] so He commanded them to kill one of their animals and made it the cause of bringing the slain man to life. The allusion here is to anyone who desires the life of his heart; he will only attain it by sacrificing his lower self since the heart of anyone who sacrifices his lower self through struggle muj훮had훮t comes to life by the lights of witnessing mush훮had훮t. Likewise when God wants someone's reputation to live forever He causes his reputation in this world to pass into obscurity."
