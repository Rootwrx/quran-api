God is aware of what you do. \ufffdIf you reveal your companionship ṣuḥba with Us and make it public you have behaved generously and well. But if you protect Our secret from the intrusion of intermediaries between us you have kept the conditions of love widād and have raised up the lofty edifice of communion wuṣla.\ufffd"
