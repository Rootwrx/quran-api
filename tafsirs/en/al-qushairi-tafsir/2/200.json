And when you have performed your holy rites is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of servanthood ʿubūdiyya. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of love maḥabba. The performance of the holy rites is an undertaking through the self nafs. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an undertaking for His sake through the heart qalb continuously in the moment and throughout one's life. It is said that \ufffdJust as others boast of their fathers and delight in their ancestors let your boasting and delight be in Us.\ufffd It is said that \ufffdIf your fathers have a right to raise and educate you Our right over you is even more binding since Our favors to you are more perfect.\ufffd It is said \ufffdYour ancestors may have glorious deeds and virtues but Our worthiness from the attributes of sublimity jalāl is far beyond anything due to your ancestors from the best of their states.\ufffd It is said that \ufffdIf you never grow weary of remembering your father and you rarely forget him then remember Us continually and do not let weariness boredom or forgetfulness stop you.\ufffd It is said that \ufffdIf someone speaks ill of your lineage you are not pleased. Similarly do not listen to the words of those who err and contrive but rather defend Us.\ufffd It is said that \ufffdThe father is remembered with respect and deference. Similarly remember Us with awe even as you [also] remember the kind- ness of nearness and the best of caring.\ufffd He said \ufffdRemember God as you remember your fathers\ufffd but did not say \ufffdyour mothers\ufffd because the father is remembered out of respect and the mother is remembered out of com- passion for her. God shows mercy-He is not the recipient of it. Or yet more intensely because the Real ḥaqq is more deserving aḥaqq. You might be much estranged from your father while the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is free from any thought coming to those who have knowledge of Him that they would oppose what has been made obligatory in even the smallest way. As you remember your fathers the father according to his rightful due and the Lord according to His rightful due."
