Without a doubt they have plunged into the fire on their path. Had they known that their ancestors had no intelligence to restrain them nor guidance to unite them they would have withdrawn from them [understanding them to be] hostile and resisted them [understanding them to be] oppositional [to God's com- mand]. But the lights of insight were snatched from them and they were deprived of the proofs of certainty."
