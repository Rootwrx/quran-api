The one who spoke for them said: Everything has an almsgiving to be paid. The almsgiving of beauty is a mercy like Mine. Through the abundant increases in aspirations and the subtleties of vision He brings about in those who pursue and seek they are lifted up and their states become states of bewilderment. \ufffdAnd bow with those that bow following the traditions of the pious forefathers salaf in what they used to do avoiding the practice of isola- tion for being in a dense congregation ghumār is sounder than being separated from people.\ufffd"
