The words of God most high testify to that [in addressing the wives of the Prophet] Whoever of you commits manifest indecency the chastisement shall be doubled for her [33:30]. The children of Israel worshiped the calf so God most high said \ufffdThen We pardoned you after that.\ufffd To the community [of Muḥammad ﷺ] He said \ufffdand whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it\ufffd [99:8]."
