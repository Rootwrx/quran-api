Truly those that prefer the other ghayr over the unseen ghayb the cre- ation khalq over the Real ḥaqq the lower self nafs over intimacy uns [with God] how hard are their hearts ma aqsā qulūbahum how shameless what they love and seek wa-mā awqaḥa maḥbūbahum wa-maṬlūbahum how cheap their worth and how disgraceful for those who have eyes to see! That is because God has revealed the Book in truth and made its decree and rule come to pass in sincerity and brought them to that for which He prepared them and established them on the way He has fashioned for them."
