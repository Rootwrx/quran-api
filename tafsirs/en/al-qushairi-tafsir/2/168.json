  "text": "O people eat of what is in the earth lawful and wholesome; and fol- low not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you; That which is forbidden even if it is pleasing now is contaminated in the end. That which is permitted even if it is hateful now is wholesome in the end. The pure and permitted [can be understood as] that which is acquired without forgetting the Real. It is said that that which is permitted is what the gatherer obtains for His sake and acquires while witnessing the Real in every state. Anything that causes you to forget the Real or disobey the Real is from the steps of Satan."
