[Except those who] compensate for their past negligence by graciously turning back taking on the task of giving advice to the aspirants. They show clearly to [the aspirants] the goodness in upholding certain modes of behavior explaining and demonstrating this to them in a beautiful way. Surely the clearest proof of the clarity of your actions and the truest tes- timony of that by which you call people to God is that your behavior does not contradict what you have alluded to in your speech. God most high said \ufffdAnd I do not desire to be inconsistent in what I forbid you\ufffd [11:88]."
