  "text": "The sacred month for the sacred month; holy things demand retalia- tion; whoever commits aggression against you then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you; and fear God and know that God is with the God-fearing. [Here] the allusion is to: \ufffdWhen two of the rights of God face off submit the moment waqt to the decree of the moment ḥukm al-waqt and turn with the allusions of the moment ishārāt al-waqt. Beware of preferring one over the other in what you possess in your worldly portion ḥaẓẓ- even a little-for you will be veiled from witnessing the Real ḥaqq and the vision of your heart will be blinded. Everything that is closer to what opposes your whims and further from what attracts and pleases you is in itself more appropriate.\ufffd And know that God is with the God-fearing those who fear the prefer- ence of their own whims over that with which He is pleased. When they act for God in what they do rather than for themselves God most high is with them through [His] help: He said \ufffdIf you help God He will help you\ufffd [47:7]."
