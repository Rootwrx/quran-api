If they had only preferred drawing near iqbāl to God over being dis- tracted ishtighāl from Him they would have obtained the treasure of the two abodes dhukhra al-dārayn and reached the glory of the two worlds ʿizza al-kawnayn. But the blows of subjugation pressed upon them kasa- bathum saṬawātu al-qahr and kept them in the lands of abandonment fa-athbatathum fī mawāṬini al-hajr."
