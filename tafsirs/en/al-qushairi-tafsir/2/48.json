He causes fear in ordinary people by His acts for He said fear the day and fear the fire [2:24 3:131]. But He causes fear in the elect by His attributes for He said And say: \ufffdAct for God will surely see your actions and [so will] His Messenger\ufffd [9:105] and He said And you are not occupied with any busi- ness... but We are witnesses over you when you are engaged therein [10:61]. He causes fear in the elect of the elect by Himself for He said God warns you of His Self [3:28 3:30]. [The word] \ufffdcompensation\ufffd ʿadl [here] means \ufffdransom\ufffd fidāÌ. On the Day of the Resurrection no intercession will be heard except for the one whom the Real has commanded to intercede for Him. He has permitted it and He in actuality is the greatest intercessor even though the term \ufffdintercessor\ufffd is not applied to Him because it is without [divine] instruction tawqīf.133 It is said about it: Praise be to God in gratitude for everything good is with Him. The lover has become my intercessor to my intercessor to Him. The intercession of intercessors will not benefit those who have been hit by the calamity of fate. There will be no helpers for them nor ransom accepted from them even if they had the fill of the heavens and earths"
