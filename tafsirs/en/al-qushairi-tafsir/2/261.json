  "text": "The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains; so God multiplies for whom He will; God is Embracing Knowing. The compensation for [those who expend their wealth in the way of God] is the garden. The compensation of those who expend their spir- its in the way of God is the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. What a difference between the compensation for one who expends his wealth and finds his reward and the [compensation for] one who expends his state and finds nearness! Expending wealth in His way [happens] by [giving] alms ṣadaqa and expending [one's] states in His way [happens] through constant sincerity ṣidq413 and by negating every worldly concern or portion so that you are pleased with the flowing of His decree over you without any frowning of the heart. The one who spoke for them said: I want to be with him but he wants me to depart. So I leave want I want for what he wants. There are two types of expenditure: the expending of worshipers ʿābidūn and the expending of ecstatics wājidūn. When worshipers give grain it multiplies for them seventy times to what is beyond reckoning. As for the ecstatics it is as it is said: There is nothing good we can bring that they will accept and if we do harm for them there is no erasure."
