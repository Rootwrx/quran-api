The diversity of [religious] paths in spite of the unity of the source does not prevent a goodly acceptance [for all]. For anyone who affirms the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd in His signs and believes in what He has said concerning His truth and attributes the dissimilarity of [religious] laws and diversity that occurs in [the] name[s] [of religion] is not a problem in terms of who merits [God's] good pleasure. Because of that He said \ufffdSurely those who believe and those of the Jews.\ufffd Then He said \ufffdwhoever believes\ufffd meaning if they fear [God] in [their] different ways of knowing [Him] all of them will have a beautiful place of return and an ample reward. The believer muÌmin is anyone in the protection amān of the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. For anyone who is in His protection it is fitting that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve."
