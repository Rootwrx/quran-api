The children of Israel annoyed Moses \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and the Muslims were prohibited from following this precedent. They were commanded to be conscious of the bashfulness of the Messenger ﷺ as much as possible so that in his presence they were silent with awe. [God] most high said Support him and revere him [48:9].195 The beauty of refined behavior adab in outward circumstances is a model for the beauty of refined behavior with God inwardly."
