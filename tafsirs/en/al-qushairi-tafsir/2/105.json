  "text": "Those disbelievers of the people of the scripture and the idolaters do not wish that any good should be revealed to you from your Lord but God singles out for His mercy whom He will; God's grace is most abundant. The antipathy of the enemies toward the unwavering decency of the friends is unceasing and enduring. But the envious [one] shall not prevail lākin al-ḥasūda lā yasūd nor will he obtain what he seeks wa lā yaḥṣul lahu maqṣūd. The special qualities of mercy are sufficient for the friends even if the enemies are abased and the flanks and borders of the lands of their rejoicing are destroyed."
