  "text": "Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed Say: \ufffdGod's guidance is the true guidance.\ufffd And if you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend nor helper. \ufffdDo not concern yourself with pleasing the enemies after you have received Our good pleasure riḌāÌ for they will not be pleased with you unless you follow their religions and that is impossible. So declare yourself free of them make your difference apparent and show enmity toward them. Know that their reliance on what they find pleasing is the cause of endless wretchedness. Do not worry yourself. Call your community to free them- selves from them and their path and be for Us through Us free of anyone other than Us trusting in Our help for you are through Us and from Us.\ufffd"
