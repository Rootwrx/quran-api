That is \ufffdhe called you to declare [God's] unity tawḥīd and separate the [proper] object of worship from any other object of worship maʿbūd and limited thing maḥdūd. But you were not inclined to worship anything except what was attractive to you-the calf you adopted for yourselves and the idol you desired.\ufffd [The calf] was taken from them but its traces remained in their hearts and in the hearts of those who came after them. Because of that most Jews believe in anthropomorphism tashbīh."
