  "text": "They ask you about wine khamr and divinatory arrows. Say: \ufffdIn both is great sin and profit for men; but the sin in them is greater than the usefulness.\ufffd Khamr is whatever intoxicates the mind. Just as khamr is specifically prohib- ited so also drunkenness sukr is prohibited by the words of the Prophet ﷺ \ufffdKhamr itself is prohibited and drunkenness from any drink.\ufffd From the point of view of the allusions [in the verse] anyone who is drunk from the drink of heedlessness deserves the same as the one who drinks khamr. Just as the one who is drunk is prohibited from praying so the one who is possessed by the drunkenness of heedlessness is veiled from intimate com- munications muwāṣalāt and the clearest testimonial evidence of ecstatic finding wujūd. Anyone who does not think this is true should test it. The notion of gambling can be found in most of the transactions of the people of heedlessness when they follow the way of stratagem and decep- tion and lie in what they say. Wholehearted commitment to truthfulness and equitable dealings is rare and precious. And they will ask you what they should expend. Say: \ufffdComfortably\ufffd al-ʿafw. So God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect on this world and the hereafter. It is said that al-ʿafw is what is in excess of your needs. This is for the elect who take from the surplus of their wealth according to their capacities. As for the elect of the elect their way is \ufffdpreference\ufffd īthār which is to prefer others over themselves even if they are in need of what they give and even though the One they prefer is unseen. They will ask you about orphans. Say: \ufffdTo set their affairs aright; and if you intermix with them they are your brothers; Setting their state aright in teaching them discipline and manners taÌdīb is more perfect than setting aright their wealth. Patience in bearing with them by giving counsel and abandoning one's weariness in guiding them is better than being permissive to the point that it could be said that one did not uphold one's obligation toward them. God knows well him who works corruption from him who sets aright; and had He willed He would have harassed you. Surely God is Mighty Wise.\ufffd He deals with everyone according to the intentions quṣūd that dwell in a person's heart not according to the external things one acquires in vari- ous ways."
