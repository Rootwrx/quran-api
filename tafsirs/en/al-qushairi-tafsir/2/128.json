  "text": "Our Lord! And make us submissive to You and of our seed a com- munity submissive to You; and show us our holy rites and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting the Merciful. [That is] \ufffdSubmissive muslimīn yielding to Your decree so that not one vein of ours throbs without Your good pleasure. Make from our seed a community submissive to You so that after us they will take our place in upholding Your rights.\ufffd What a difference between one who seeks someone to inherit his wealth man yaṬlubu wārithan li-mālihi and one who seeks a deputy after him to perform acts of obedience to Him in his states man yaṬlubu nāÌiban... fī aḥwālihi. [That is] \ufffdShow us our holy rites since there is no way to know what conforms [to Your will] except by the path that God granted success and communication.\ufffd [That is] \ufffdAnd relent to us after we carry out all that You have com- manded us to do so that we do not look to what we do and do not do but turn back to You from witnessing our actions so there is no danger of hidden idolatry al-shirk al-khafī in imagining anything from us or through us.\ufffd"
