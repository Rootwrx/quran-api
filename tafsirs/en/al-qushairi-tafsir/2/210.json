The people thought that the Hour would be long in coming but the details tell them of the severity of the matter. [What are described] are acts af ʿāl [of God] only in the sense of the terrible events ahwāl [of that Hour]. God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd divulges them so as to remove their doubt concerning the gran- deur of His affair and the implementation of His power in what He wills. The matter is determined and to God all matters are returned that is the veil of the unseen is removed exposing the clarity of the [divine] preordination. The hearts of those who declare His oneness are lit by the lights of insights and [therefore] they have no need to seek interpretation taÌwīl of this verse and those like it since [they know] the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is far removed from any change in locality or fading or specificity in place or time. He is sanctified from every movement and appearing [before human beings]."
