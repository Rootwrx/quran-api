Say: \ufffdEvil is that which your belief enjoins on you if you are believers.\ufffd He reiterates the tale of their excessive love for the calf their aversion to accepting the Real and [... ] and their being told of the punishment that would overtake them for the evil they did. No counsel was useful to them and no punishment led them to refrain from their disobediences. They paid no mind to censure lā bi-l-dhamm fīhim iḥtafalū and did not act according to what the situation required wa-lā bi-mūjibi al-amr ʿamilū."
