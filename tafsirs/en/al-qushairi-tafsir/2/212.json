They were deceived without realizing it. The increasing darkness of their vision caused them to slander and to deride the friends [of God] \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. When people bear witness [on the Day of Resurrection] and when the error of ignorance is dispelled from their hearts they will know those who are in a state of loss and those who have gone far astray."
