  "text": "The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing save a call and a cry; deaf dumb blind-they do not comprehend. Without the ears of comprehension and acceptance their bodily hearing did not benefit them. They descended to the status of animals incapable of actualization taḥṣīl. Whoever is content to be like an animal man raḌiya an yakūn ka-l-bahīma does not have much worth lam yaqaʿu ʿalayhi kathīr al-qīma."
