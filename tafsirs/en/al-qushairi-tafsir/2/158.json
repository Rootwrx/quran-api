  "text": "Truly ṣafā and Marwa are among the symbols of God These sites and relics tilka al-mashāhidu wa-l-rusūm these ruins and remains wa-tilka al-aṬlālu wa-l-ruqūm are extolled and visited. One sets out for them because they are the ruins of the lovers where the vestiges [still] gleam: The passions of houses belong to those who have lived in them. There is no concern or joy in the house itself. Truly the earth of their path even the dust of their footprints has tre- mendous value for the lovers. Even the smallest bit of dust that falls upon the edges of their path is more precious than the most fragrant musk: And that is only because Umayma walked beside it in a group [of women] trailing a garment. so whoever makes the pilgrimage to the House or the visitation he would not be at fault if he circumambulates them; and whoever volunteers good God is Grateful Knowing. ṣafā and Marwa were favored by being close to the House. The running between the two became part of the law just as the circumambulation became part of the law for the House. Just as the circumambulation is one of the main rites of the pilgrimage so is the running. The neighbor is honored for the sake of the neighbor."
