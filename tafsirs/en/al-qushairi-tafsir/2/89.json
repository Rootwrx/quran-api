  "text": "\\ When there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them-and they formerly prayed for victory over the disbelievers; but when there came to them what they recognized they disbelieved in it; and the curse of God is on the disbelievers. Here the allusion is to one who resolves upon purity and clarity ṣafāÌ and promises his complete loyalty wafāÌ. He raises the banners of his vigor to step out to combat but when the call comes to line up and advance boldly into battle he breaks down at the rallying of the ranks and cuts himself off from the group afraid of dangerous attacks. God most high said \ufffdThen when the matter has been resolved upon if they are loyal to God it will be better for them\ufffd [47:21]."
