  "text": "And We have revealed to you clear proofs; and none disbelieves inthem except the wicked. Why whenever they make a covenant does a party of them reject itḍ Nay but most of them are disbelievers. One disbelieves in His clear signs only when one's eyes are blocked from perceiving and one's fate from God has already been determined as unfor- tunate. There is no sense in anyone who denies that day is day. Likewise there is no union for anyone who has not been assisted by lights and insights from the Real. Why whenever they made a covenant...: their predetermined fate sābiq al-taqdīr confounded them and their subsequent contrivances lāḥiq al-tadbīr broke their covenant. God prevails over His affair."
