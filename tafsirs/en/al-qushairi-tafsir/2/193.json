The allusion in the verse is to combat against the lower selves nufūs for your worst enemy is your lower self nafs within you. That is to say \ufffdHold completely to the precepts of spiritual disciplines riyāḌāt until nothing remains of carnal human traces āthār bashariyya. Submit the self nafs and heart qalb to God so there will be no opponent or combatant from within you [fighting] to protect [yourself] taking instruction [from the lower self] managing [your own affairs] or exercising free choice in any state. The vicissitudes [of life] will flow over you as He wills them and you will be effaced from making any choices aside from what comes with the decree.\ufffd When the self nafs surrenders there is no enmity except toward the masters of holding back arbāb al-taqṣīr but those who uphold the right of [God's] command are far removed from any obligation to compel [others to do so]."
