  "text": "O you who believe fear God and give up the usury that is outstand- ing if you are believers. Being content with what is promised mawʿūd by the Lord is better for the one who submits than attaching one's heart to what the lower self seeks maqṣūd. What you seek maqṣūd is from the deceptions of the lower self while what you are promised mawʿūd is guaranteed by the Real."
