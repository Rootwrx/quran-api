  "text": "Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as one whom Satan has made prostrate from touch; that is because they say \ufffdTrade is like usury\ufffd: God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists he shall have his past gains and his affair is committed to God; but whoever reverts-those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. Those who turn away from the command giving themselves license from their own interpretation taÌwīl have neither secure independence in the present moment lā istiqlālun lahum fī l-ḥāl nor recovery in the end wa- lā intiʿāshun fī l-maÌāl. They lose in their current life khasirū fī ʿājilihim and have no profit in their future wa-lam yarbaḥū fī ājilihim. Those who heed the calls of admonition curb the bridle of their whims and do not give free rein to persist [in prohibited actions] are granted respite for the present. However if they return to these blameworthy states let them wait for the swiftest uprooting and sudden chastisement."
