  "text": "If he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him after that until she marries another husband. If he divorces her then neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other A man finds it unbearable for his wife to marry another so [God] prevents him from choosing separation with the intention of keeping her from remarrying. He explains that once he has separated from her she will not be lawful for him until she does what he would find unbearable and that is a second marriage. So [this will make him] cautious as much as he is able in [initiating] divorce. Then He said \ufffdIf he divorces her\ufffd meaning the spouse \ufffdthen neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other\ufffd meaning if she remarries the first husband. Here the allusion is that love's hold on the heart makes what would otherwise be hard to endure easy for if after separating the spouses regret their lost union and then feel the greatest remorse there is no fault in their returning to each other. But the woman in this circumstance is protected from her husband by the threat of another husband for the husband would himself be making that possible [if he were to divorce her three times]. if they think that they will maintain God's bounds. Those are God's bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge. This means that after they know how much they need each other as com- panions they will not separate again. The one who spoke for them said: I swore that if I were to meet you one more time I would never separate from you a second time."
