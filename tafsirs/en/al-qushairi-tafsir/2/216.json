  "text": "Prescribed for you is fighting though it be hateful to you. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you; God knows and you know not. The engagement with fighting is difficult for the lower selves. [God] explained that the comforts of the lower selves are deferred muÌajjala because they follow the ordinance of discipline taÌdīb. It is the opposite for the comforts of the hearts which are immediate muʿajjala since they follow the property of drawing near taqrīb. Happiness lies in opposing mukhālafa the lower selves for anyone who conforms wāfaqa to them has abandoned the exemplary path al-maḥajjat al-muthlā. Likewise happiness lies in conforming muwāfaqa to the hearts for anyone who opposes khālafa them deviates from the highest way al-sunnat al-ʿulā. It is better to accept the good news of the Real's guarantee of ease than the anxious thoughts of the lower selves that warn of impending difficulty and harm."
