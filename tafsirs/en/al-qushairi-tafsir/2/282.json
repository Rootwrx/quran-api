  "text": "O you who believe when you contract a debt one upon another for a stated term write it down; and let a writer write it down between you justly; and let not any writer refuse to write it down as God has taught him; so let him write and let the debtor dictate; and let him fear God his Lord and not diminish anything of it. And if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let his guardian dictate justly. And summon to bear witness two witnesses men; or if the two be not men then one man and two women such witnesses as you approve of so that if one of the two women errs; the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse whenever they are summoned; and be not disdainful to write it down small or great with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight more upright for testimony and nearer that you will not be in doubt unless it be trade carried out there and then that you give and take between you then you will not be at fault if you do not write it down. And take witnesses when you are trading with one another. And let not either writer or witness be pressed; and if you do that is sinfulness in you. And fear God. God teaches you and God knows all things. And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a writer then a pledge in hand. But if one of you trusts another let him who is trusted deliver his trust and let him fear God his Lord. And do not conceal the testimony; whoever conceals it his heart is sinful; and God knows what you do. God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd commands created beings to act with sincerity á¹£idq. He teaches them the particulars of their transactions with one another and teaches them to adopt caution and bear witness [as explained in this verse] so that no injury will occur between them. That is in accordance with His mercy toward them and follows from His kindness to them so that they will not be adversaries. He commands that rights be strengthened by writing and tak- ing witnesses and commands [this] witnessing from the outset and through the execution [of the transaction]."
