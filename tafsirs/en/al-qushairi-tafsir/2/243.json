Truly God is bounteous [dhū faḌl] to people but most people are not thankful. When [the children of Israel] deemed God's power to restore [them] unlikely He showed [His power] to them directly in their own selves. The outward disclosure of that however did not benefit those who had not sharpened their insight regarding divine unity tawḥīd. Anyone whose insight has been strengthened will not be harmed by a lack of these direct forms of evidence for they have already realized through their faith in the unseen the truth of what they have been told."
