  "text": "Then their prophet said to them \ufffdVerily God has raised up Saul for you as king.\ufffd They said \ufffdHow can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealthḍ\ufffd He said \ufffdGod has chosen him over you and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body jism. God gives the kingship to whom He will; and God is Embracing Knowing. They forgot [God's] right of free choice ikhtiyār and viewed the situation instead with the eye of the external world. They deemed it unlikely that Saul could be a king because he was poor and without property. [God] explained to them that merit is by the choice of the Real and that if [Saul] lacked wealth \ufffdGod has increased him in knowledge and has favored him over you by his knowledge and body jism.\ufffd It is said that He meant that [Saul] was praiseworthy in the qualities of the self nafs not large in [his] physical frame binya for as it is said in the adage \ufffdSo and so is a name without a body fulān ism bi-lā jism\ufffd that is a man without substance."
