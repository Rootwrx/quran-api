What the tongue says inadvertently does not have much importance either for good or bad but what is hidden in the recesses of the heart ḌamāÌir and contained in its inner secrets sarāÌir in [terms of] genuine intentions and strong resolutions-that will be taken into account. If it is good there will be a beautiful recompense jazāÌun jamīl and if it is bad there will be prolonged distress ʿanāÌun Ṭawīl."
