  "text": "Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees a thing He but says to it \ufffdBe\ufffd and it is. The Originator al-badīʿ according to the scholars is the One who brings the entity ʿayn into existence without any model lā ʿalā mithāl. According to the people of allusion He is the One and there is nothing like Him laysa lahu shayun mithlihi since this term alludes to both the negation of any likeness mithl to His essence and the negation of any model mithāl for His acts. He is the One al-aḥad without any quantity comprising Him; the Eternal al-ṣamad whom no final point in time cuts off; the Real al-ḥaqq whom no imagination can picture; and the Existent al-mawjūd of whom no understanding is capable. When He decides on an affair nothing preordained maqdūr can oppose it and nothing created mafṬūr can separate itself from His decree."
