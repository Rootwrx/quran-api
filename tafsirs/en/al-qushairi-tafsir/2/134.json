The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd sent down to each [community] its place and singled out for each one its status according to His decree á¸¥ukm. There is no news about their outward forms and no trace remaining of what distinguished each group from the others. Each is a king in his own region and each has a celestial sphere revolving in felicity."
