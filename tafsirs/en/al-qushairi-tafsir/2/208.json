  "text": "O you who believe come all of you into submission; and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you. [God] has charged the believer with making peace with everyone except his lower self for it makes no move except to oppose [the believer's] leader sayyid. Anyone who makes peace with himself becomes listless in his spiritual exertions mujāhadāt. This is the reason a seeker falls short and an aspirant loses interest. The steps of Satan are what are whispered to you about your inability to hold to the precepts of moral behavior and [your inability] to abandon unwise inclinations that are best ignored. But it is as God most high said \ufffdIf you fear for him cast him into the waters\ufffd [28:7]. Look what He did with [Moses] when [Moses's mother] cast him [into the water] and how He returned him to her after saving him!"
