As for the enemies nothing [that is no payment or compensation] will be accepted from them. As for the friends [the Prophet] ﷺ said \ufffdProtect yourself from the fire even if it be by half a date [given in charity].\ufffd The intercession of intercessors will not benefit the disbeliever for this is a determination made for each community with their prophet. As for the believers they will benefit in particular from the Prophet's ﷺ intercession. Everyone on that day will be saying \ufffdMy soul my soul\ufffd but our Prophet ﷺ will say \ufffdMy community my community.\ufffd"
