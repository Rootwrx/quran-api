  "text": "Or do you say: \ufffdAbraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the tribes- they were Jews or they were Christiansḍ\ufffd Say: \ufffdHave you then greater knowl- edge or has Godḍ And who does greater injustice than he who conceals a testimony received from Godḍ And God is not heedless of what you do.\ufffd Whoever looks from himself to creation forms an image of each thing based on his own character and considers everything to be something like him. When they by virtue of being outsiders [to the Real] judged the prophets [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd] according to their own state the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd threw their conjecture back upon them and left them with their own opinion. Are those who have been drawn away from their own testimony like those who are veiled by itḍ Is the one who is snatched away from all of it equal to the one who is thrown back to what is like himḍ That is the conjecture of those who disbelieve-what misery is theirs!"
