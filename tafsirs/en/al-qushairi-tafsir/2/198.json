  "text": "You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty from your Lord; [Here] the allusion is that whatever you seek from the bounty of God-from what has been determined for you according to His rightful decree-is praiseworthy if it has a portion for the Muslims or the strength of the religion dīn. Whatever you seek solely for your worldly fortune or for what benefits you is flawed. but when you press on from ʿArafāt then remember God at the sacred waymark; and remember Him as He has guided you though previously you were astray. [Here] the allusion is to when you have gone so far as to perform what He has requested [you should] remember His favor with you for if He had not desired you you would not have desired Him. If He had not chosen you you would not have preferred His good pleasure."
