  "text": "And when Abraham said \ufffdMy Lord make this land secure and pro- vide its people with fruits; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day\ufffd He said \ufffdAnd whoever disbelieves to him I shall give enjoyment a little then I shall compel him to the chastisement of the fire-how evil a journey's end!\ufffd And when Abraham said 'My Lord make this land secure': The request was answered because it was not adulterated by the worldly concern of the servant. Abraham's request was not for his own concern ḥaẓẓ but rather for the right ḥaqq of his Lord may He be exalted and glorified. When Abraham was mindful of the required etiquette in seeking provision for those who believed they were granted that-but so were those who did not believe. [On the other hand] when he spoke about leadership saying \ufffdAnd of my seedḍ\ufffd [2:125] without [divine] permission [the request] was denied and it was said to him \ufffdMy covenant shall not reach the evildoers\ufffd [2:125]."
