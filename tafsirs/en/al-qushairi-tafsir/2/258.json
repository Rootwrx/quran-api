  "text": "Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord that God had given him the kingshipḍ When Abraham said \ufffdMy Lord is He who gives life and makes to die\ufffd he said \ufffdI give life and make to die.\ufffd Abraham said: \ufffdGod brings the sun from the east; so bring it from the west.\ufffd Then the disbeliever was confused; and God guides not the folk who do evil. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd hastened the punishment of separation furqa for His ene- mies before He punished them with burning ḥurqa. This punishment [of separation] was in actuality more powerful in its effect if they had had the eye of insight [to see this]. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd relates that Abraham \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd moved from one sound proof with the accursed enemy to another which was clearer not because there was anything wrong with the [first] proof but because of the shortcomings in the understanding of the disbeliever. The touchstone of one whose sight is blocked from recognizing the truth is the wasting of time without any useful benefit. It is not about the quality of the proof for a matter about which there is no question."
