Surely You are the Knower Wise.\ufffd [The angels] offered praise before they made their apology and declared the truth of His judgment over any objection they might have. It means \ufffdWe have no knowledge of that which You have asked us about and there is no blame that can be directed to You for charging those who are incapable with something You know they cannot do. Surely You are the Knower Wise that is what You do is true and sincere there is none who can pass judgment over You and there is no foolishness nor ugliness from You.\ufffd"
