  "text": "And if any man should be in difficulty then [let there be] respite till things are easier; but that you should give a voluntary almsgiving is better for you did you but know. When the insolvency of a detained man is determined before the judge it is not permissible to continue his detention. If the proof of the man's insolvency is demonstrated that [proof] is taken in security for what is due his adversary. But he is in a period of respite and delay. In that the Lord does not judge us but with His knowledge of our difficulties and weakness and the sincerity of our need for Him and our dedication to Him He is merciful with us. His words \ufffdtill things are easier\ufffd [relate to] the poor insolvent man [who] has no way to obtain anything for himself except through what God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd appoints for him as the portion of debtors. Income accrues to those who have the goods and the contract. What does the insolvent [per- son] have to do with itḍ What does the insolvent [person] have to do with profit in trade from the transformation of capital and what is done with itḍ What is left for the insolvent [person]ḍ The jurists say he must seek work if he is healthy. If he is weak then this [statement that he must seek work] applies only if he has enough physical strength. As for those who are bankrupt in vigor just as one is bankrupt in wealth what way remains for him except what his Protector appoints for himḍ"
