  "text": "The pilgrimage is in months well-known; The pilgrimage for the bodily selves nufūs is in months well-known. The iḥrām is only binding in it and it is not possible to undertake the pilgrimage during the rest of the year rather [it is] only in a specific time period. One for whom that time has passed the pilgrimage has passed him. Likewise the pilgrimage of the hearts has times [that are] well-known and [it] is only appropriate during them. These are the days of youth for one who has no spiritual desire irāda in his youth has no communion in the state of his old age. Likewise the one for whom the time of his quest qaṣd and spiritual desire irāda has passed only the worship whose outcome is the garden is appropriate not the spiritual desire irāda whose outcome is communion. whoever undertakes the duty of pilgrimage during them then no lewdness nor wickedness or disputing in the pilgrimage. The allusion is also to whoever travels the path of spiritual desire that he should not stop at anything in the path nor mix his spiritual desire with anything. Whoever argues opposes or is rude with him-he yields to them all. He does not dispute with anyone for the sake of this world nor does he compete with anyone for some worldly fortune for the self or honor. God most high said \ufffdAnd when the ignorant address them they say 'peace'\ufffd [25:63]. Whatever good you do God knows it. You should be content with His knowledge and His judgment rather than being seen judged or known by His creatures. And take provision. But the best provision is piety; and fear Me O people of pith! The piety of ordinary people is the avoidance of errors while the piety of the elect is the avoidance of anything other [than God] in the inner secrets of their hearts."
