  "text": "Not so; whoever earns evil and is encompassed by his transgression- those are the inhabitants of the fire therein abiding khālidūn. In the language of scholars168 the one who is encompassed by his trans- gression is the disbeliever. But the allusion in it is to one whose heart has ceased its perpetual calling for help. The possessors of realities are like grain in the frying pan in their moments of wakefulness ṣaḥw. Those [of them] who have become still are thus because of His excessive majesty not because they are listless. Whoever relies on obedience seeks favor from it and thinks that he [can] draw near by means of it but he should keep his distance from this [idea]. Whoever comes to know the truth of God's unity knows that there is no means to Him except through Him."
