  "text": "And they say \ufffdBe Jews or Christians and you will be guided.\ufffd Say \ufffdNay rather the creed of Abraham a ḥanīf; and he was not of the idolaters.\ufffd [That is] \ufffdWhen the groups contended with you [Muḥammad] they demanded that you agree muwāfaqa with them. Stand firm in opposing that to which they call you and turn your attention increasingly to Us. Follow the way of the Friend al-khalīl in withdrawing from the group whether it be one's own father or anyone else who is not in accord lā yuwāfiqu with his Protector.\ufffd Thus he said \ufffdAnd I shall shun you and that which you call upon besides God\ufffd [19:48]. The ḥanīf is the \ufffdone who leans\ufffd toward the straight truth on the path the truth free from any defect of creation. [He is] in agreement wāfiq with the truth by the Truth."
