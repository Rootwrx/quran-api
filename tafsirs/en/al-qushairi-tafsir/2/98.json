Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael-then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers.\ufffd The Jews claimed that Gabriel did not come with good that they did not love him and that if it had been Michael they would have believed in him. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd showed them to be liars when He said \ufffdWhoever is an enemy to Gabriel [thinking] he did not bring good what good is greater than the QurÌān that descended through himḍ\ufffd Then He said that whoever is an enemy to Gabriel and Michael God is his enemy. Surely the messenger of the Beloved to the highly-esteemed beloved [Muḥammad] has a noble status and weighty rank. The enmity of the disbelievers does not harm Gabriel-the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is his protector walī. Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel God is his enemy. How mighty and glori- fied is this status! How grand is His exaltedness!"
