  "text": "Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods. He commanded divorced women to wait out of respect for spousal rela- tions. This means \ufffdIf the relationship has been cut off between the two of you observe the condition of fulfilling [the waiting period] for the sake of what occurred in the past in the relationship. Do not put others quickly in place of [the former spouse]. Be patient until the allotted period has passed.\ufffd Do you not see that the bride whose marriage was not consum- mated is not commanded to undergo a waiting period since there were no spousal relations between the two of themḍ And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. This means that even if the tie between the two of you has been severed do not sever what God has established in the parental relationship. Their mates have a better right to restore them This means that the one with the prior relationship [the husband who ini- tiated the divorce] has a better right to restore the breach in the marriage [before the wife's marrying again]. in such time if they desire to set things right; This means that the [husband's] intention to return should be to set things right in the estrangement that has occurred not to prolong the waiting period for her if he has decided to divorce her after he has taken her back. women shall have rights similar to those due from them with justice; This means if he has a right over her for what he has expended in wealth she has a right in the situation for [her] past service. but their men have a degree above them; God is Mighty Wise. [The man has the degree] in merit faḌīla but she has an advantage mazīya in weakness and human vulnerability."
