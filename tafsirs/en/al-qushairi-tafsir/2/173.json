God is Forgiving Merciful. He has forbidden in outward circumstances these specific things which have been hallowed to other than God. He has forbidden to the innermost hearts companionship with other than God and even witnessing anything other than God. Yet whoever is constrained that is anyone who has not found a means to annihilation in the realities of the Real should only travel by way of the law. Either he should be effaced in God or stand by means of God or act for God. Otherwise he is a foolish man of no account."
