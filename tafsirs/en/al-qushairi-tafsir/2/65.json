When [the children of Israel] abandoned [God's] command and disdained the laws that were imposed on them the punishments came quickly in their disgrace metamorphosis and in the other things which are included in the [QurÌānic text]. Because of their violation of the covenant and rejection of the limit [imposed by God] the community was punished through the metamorphosis of their hearts and the alteration of their states. [God] most high said \ufffdAnd We shall confound their hearts and their eyes; just as they did not believe the first time\ufffd [6:110]. The punishments of hearts are far worse than the punishments of the bodily selves. About this they have recited: O you who ask me \ufffdHow have you been after himḍ\ufffd I suffered that which tormented me while it made him happy. I kept strutting about in our togetherness and felt safe from the ruses of time. But the turning away from me went on until not a bit of what I had experienced remained."
