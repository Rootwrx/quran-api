  "text": "And when We made a covenant for you and We raised above you the mount \ufffdTake forcefully what We have given you and remember what is in it so that you might preserve yourselves.\ufffd Then you turned away thereafter and but for God's bounty and His mercy toward you you would have been among the losers. He \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd made a covenant with all responsible beings and some responded willingly because He made Himself known to them and they declared His unity fa-waḥḥadūhu. Other people responded unwill- ingly because He veiled them so they did not want to recognize Him fa-jaḥadūhu. There is no proof more powerful than the eyewitnessing of the mount Ṭūr He raised above them which was a mountain jabal but they lacked the light of inner sight baṣīra and so the witnessing of physical vision baṣar did not benefit them. Then you turned away thereafter that is you returned to disobedience after witnessing the signs with your own eyes. If not for His decree in grant- ing respite and His forbearance through acts of grace He would punish you without delay and cause a great misfortune to descend upon you and your deeds would be entirely a loss."
