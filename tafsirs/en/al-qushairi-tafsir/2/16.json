  "text": "Those are they who have bought error for guidance; so their commerce has not profited them; nor are they guided. This alludes to those who have neglected what is due ḥuqūq by remain- ing in the familiar territories of worldly fortunes ḥuẓūẓ. [They] have lost their bargain so their commerce has not profited them. Those who are content with this world over the next are in manifest loss. Those who prefer this world or the next over the Real have the most intense loss. Although the one who suffers the loss of [the gardens] of bliss will come up short the one who is afflicted with distance from intimate conversation and the disengagement of his heart from his Protector the one who remains in the captivity of carnal desires with no messenger [reaching] his heart the one without attainment for his spirit without intimate conversation with Him without approach to Him without the witnessing [of Him] in his innermost self-this is the one who [truly] suffers and is afflicted. If even a moment slips away his Lord has slipped away. Moments have no substitutes or alternates. Thus someone said: You were the pupil of my eye. [The organ] by which I see wept for you. Anyone who has a will after you let him die for I used to be a guard over you."
