It is said that the word \ufffdto think\ufffd ẓann is used here to mean \ufffdcertainty\ufffd yaqīn which would be the most obvious [meaning]. What is meant by it is \ufffdreckoning\ufffd ḥusbān. Those who reckon with the reckoning of certainty ẓanna ẓann al-yaqīn are those who experience the communion [of lovers]. Those who reckon by the reckoning of guessing ẓanna ẓann al-takhmīn are those who experience separation. [The phrase] they shall meet their Lord mulāqū rabbihim is in a gram- matical form appropriate for the past present and future. Because the folk have recognized the truth of what will be according to the decrees of the unseen they have reached the point that it is as if the promise has already been determined for them and the unseen is present for them."
