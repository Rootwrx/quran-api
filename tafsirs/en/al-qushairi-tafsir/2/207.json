  "text": "But there are other men who sell themselves desiring God's pleasure; and God is gentle with His servants. Those who have been touched by the special favors of mercy and raised up by the fate already preordained [for them] prefer the good pleasure of the Real over themselves and submit entirely to their protector mawlā. God is gentle with His servants and because of His gentleness they attain these states-they do not deserve His gentleness because of these states."
