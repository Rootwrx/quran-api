  "text": "O people worship your Lord who created you and those that were before you so that you may be fearful. Worship ʿibāda is becoming harmonious muwāfaqa with the command and it is pouring all energy into requests for realization taḥqīq of the unseen. The declaration of oneness tawḥīd enters one through the heart disengagement tajrīd [enters] through the innermost self becoming single-minded tafrīd [comes] through intention qaṣd and humility [comes] through the self. Surrender istislām is to the decree ḥukm. It is said \ufffdworship Him\ufffd by renouncing prohibited things persevering in performing acts of obedience welcoming obligatory acts with humility and lowliness and avoiding detours through the waystations of laziness and indifference. His saying \ufffdso that you may be fearful\ufffd is to bring the command closer to them and to make it easier. By the word \ufffdmay\ufffd He keeps them at the bounds of fear and hope. The real meaning of \ufffdfear of God\ufffd taqwā is protecting oneself through conformity [to God's command] from the threats of punishment."
