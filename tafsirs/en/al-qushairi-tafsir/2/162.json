Abiding therein: the chastisement shall not be lightened for them no respite shall be given them. Here the allusion is to those who after they have traveled the path of spiritual desire irāda find it fitting to return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda.261 Then while they are in the grip of this estrange- ment [from the path] and in this condition [they] leave the world.  Those are the companions of separation aṣḥāb al-furqa. There is no drawing near for their spirits or setting straight their calamity no asking for mercy from anyone. They have lost in this world and the hereafter. They are cursed by gnats in the air and stagnation in [their] water yalʿanuhum al-baqqu fī l-hawāÌi wa-l-naqʿu ʿalā l-māÌi. Abiding: that is they remain forever in their contemptible position insignificant and [find no] lessening of it or relief without kindness or favors."
