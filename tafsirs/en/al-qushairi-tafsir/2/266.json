  "text": "But the likeness of those who expend their wealth seeking God's good pleasure and to confirm themselves is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it then soft rain [falls upon it] and God sees what you do. Would any of you wish to have a garden of date palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and he has seed but they are weak; then a whirlwind with fire smites it and it is consumed. So God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect. These are numerous signs that God mentions by way of striking similitudes for the sincere one and the hypocrite-while the one spends in the way of God the other spends his wealth in vain. While [the sincere] will obtain honor and compensation khalaf for themselves [the hypocrites] will receive only rejection in the present and nothing but ruin talaf in the end. While the effort of these remains worthy of thanks mashkūr those leave behind destruction thubūr and come to a blazing flame. The works of these thrive their wealth grows their states rise high before God and their end will be the communion [of lovers]. The works of those will come to nothing. Their states will be of loss their hopes sealed by misfortune and their curse doubled for them. It is said that the similitude of these is like the one who planted seed; his property thrived and his surplus grew. His branches grew high and his benefit multiplied. The similitude of those is like the one whose bargaining failed; his commodity [was] stolen and his stratagem came to naught in old age. His tribulations continued one after the other in every way and in every time. How can these two be equal as examplesḍ Do they have any resemblance to one anotherḍ"
