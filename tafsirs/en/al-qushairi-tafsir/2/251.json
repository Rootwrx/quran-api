God frightened the enemies with Saul whom He had given such a large body. But at the time of the fighting He brought the victory about through the hands of David. As the story goes [David] was of middling stature not large in body a compact person. He had no weapon with him but a slingshot; the victory was his because the help of God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd was with him. And they routed them by the leave of God so that nothing not even a trace remained of them. David killed Goliath. Because of Goliath's bulk and size David's victory over him was unimaginable but as the one who spoke for them said: He met me with his sword drawn and said to me One of us is gone. Had God not repelled people some by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted; but God is bounteous to all worlds. If mankind were to make common cause and agree with one another alto- gether the weak would be destroyed by the victory of the strong. But He keeps some occupied by others so as to deflect their evil from other people."
