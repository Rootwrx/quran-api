The sending of the Messenger was to open the gates of attainment for it was in His \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd prior knowledge that the hearts of His friends would be thirsty to meet Him. There is no way for anyone to [reach God] except through the intermediary of the messengers. By sending messengers He charged some people with the burdens [of prescriptive law] kulaf and by sending messengers to others He honored them with the arts of drawing near and approaching zulaf. What a difference between one people and another!"
