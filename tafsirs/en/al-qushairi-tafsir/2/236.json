  "text": "You would not be at fault if you divorce women whom you have not touched nor appointed any obligation for them; yet make provision of com- forts for them honorably the one of ample means according to his means and the needy man according to his means-an obligation on the virtuous. If you have initiated366 the union with your mates but then change your mind [before the consummation] there is no fault on you if you choose separation for there is only One from whom it is not permissible to choose to separate. The companionship of human beings with one another is not obligatory but rather is described at most as permissible. But367 because your name and reputation are now part of theirs half of the determined amount [of the dowry] must belong to them since separation-however it comes about-is difficult. So [God] has established the required compensa- tion for [the woman] who is made to drink from the cup of separation. If there was no determined amount the contract still requires the gift muta ø because her being made to drink from the cup of separation without [some compensatory] comfort is a terrible thing for her to suffer."
