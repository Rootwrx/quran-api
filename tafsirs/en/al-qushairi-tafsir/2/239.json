That is \ufffdDo not abandon intimate conversations with Me at their [desig- nated] times in the way I have made possible for you for truly I am the One who gives power over you to the enemies you fear. But when you withdraw in your hearts through Me their hands will be unable to reach you since I have appointed victory for you over them. Then when the fear is gone from you and you are secure return to what you have established [in prayers] and exert your utmost in the times of your devotion in My presence in private or in public.\ufffd"
