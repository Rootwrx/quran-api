  "text": "And Abraham enjoined upon his sons this and [so did] Jacob 'My sons God has chosen for you the [true] religion see that you die not save in submission.' He related that Abraham \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd enjoined his sons as did Jacob \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd who said \ufffdDo not let death come upon you except in the state of submission islām.\ufffd Their laws even if they differed in details were of one origin. The spring of unity tawḥīd is not divided into two.  words of God most high \ufffdGod has chosen for you the [true] religion\ufffd were good news. By [these words] their desire to meet the demands of submission islām became strong. For when they realized that God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd had chosen them for that [islām] they knew with certainty that He would help them and make it easy for them to uphold the rightful due of submission islām."
