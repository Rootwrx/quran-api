  "text": "Honorable words and forgiveness are better than voluntary almsgiving followed by injury; and God is Independent Forbearing. This means that words spoken to the one who is poor and deprived- responding to his overture without showing censure-are better and more perfect than the alms of one who is proud of what he does and then imposes an obligation for it. It is said that an acknowledgment from you to God of your weakness and sin and God's forgiveness for you in response to these words is better than alms adulterated with reproach and accompanied by injury."
