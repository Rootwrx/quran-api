Here the allusion is to the one who recognizes a weakness in one of the aspirants murīdūn or sees in one of the novices ahl al-bidāya a laxity of purpose qaṣd. Or [it may allude to] someone giving counsel [who] speaks with pure sincerity to someone who does not have the capacity for it. He understands his kindness to the aspirant as a form of indulgence encouragement persuasion and permissiveness toward him. This is not objectionable for urging people to pure sincerity [on the path] and [encour- aging them] in what is not yet firmly established in them has an ample reward. Showing kindness to novices who are not yet firm in their resolve or sincere in their effort is a crucial element in seeking to make things right."
