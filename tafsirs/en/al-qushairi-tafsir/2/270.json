He has promised His punishment to some people His reward to others and His knowledge to others. [Those promised punishment or reward] are ordinary people and [those promised knowledge] are the elect. God most high said \ufffdAnd submit patiently to the judgment of your Lord for surely you fare before Our eyes\ufffd [52:48]. There is nothing that causes the servant to fall from the eyes of God like opposing the covenants with Him in the heart. So let the aspirant be very wary of letting his soul err in that."
