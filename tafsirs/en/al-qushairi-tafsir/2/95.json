  "text": "Say: \ufffdIf the abode of the hereafter with God is purely yours and not for other people then long for death-if you speak truly.\ufffd But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them. God knows the evildoers. Among the signs of ardent longing ishtiyāq is the desire for death while in the best of health and well-being. Whoever is absolutely and without any doubt confident that the garden is his ardently longs for it. But they did not long for the garden-and God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said that they will never long for it-and this information was a miracle for the Messenger ﷺ since it was as He had said. In this is good news for the believers who ardently long for death; there is forgiveness for them. He only bestows the ardent longing on them so that it may be actualized [when] they reach the garden. Of old it was said \ufffdFor the negligent shame will suffice on the Day of the Meeting.\ufffd God most high said \ufffdBut they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them.\ufffd"
