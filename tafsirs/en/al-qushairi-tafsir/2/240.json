  "text": "And those of you who die leaving wives make testament for their wives provision for a year; but if they go forth you would not be at fault regarding what they may do with themselves honorably; God is Mighty Wise. The waiting period after the death of the husband in the beginning of Islam was an uninterrupted year according to the words and actions of the Arabs. With respect to that the one who spoke for them said: Until the end of the year then \ufffdpeace be upon both of you.\ufffd Whoever weeps for an entire year has absolved themselves of any guilt. Then this was abrogated [and made] four months and ten days since the mourning period inevitably ends. The one who spoke for them said: He said \ufffdIf you die I cannot live.\ufffd I said \ufffdYou are being hypocritical so be silent. What living thing do you see that dies from love for something which is dead·∏ç\ufffd"
