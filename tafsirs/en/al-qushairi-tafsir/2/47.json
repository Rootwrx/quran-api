  "text": "children of Israel remember My favor wherewith I favored you and that I have preferred you above all the worlds; He called the children of Israel to bear witness to the favor or bounty faḌl granted to them saying \ufffdand that I have preferred you faḌḌaltukum above all the worlds.\ufffd He called the Muslims from the community of Muḥammad ﷺ to bear witness to the favor or bounty of God Himself saying \ufffdSay: 'In the bounty of God and in His mercy in that let them rejoice'\ufffd [10:58]. What a difference between those who bear witness to the favor or bounty they receive and those who bear witness to the bounty of their Lord Himself! The servant's acknowledgment of the favor granted him implies gratitude but with the danger of self-conceit iʿjāb. But the servant's acknowledgment of the bounty of the Real-the One whose majesty is in His description and His beauty in the worthiness of His attribute-involves praise which leads to [God's] approval ījāb."
