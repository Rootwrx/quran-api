When Adam \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd behaved badly at the fountain of nearness God most high said \ufffdGo down some of you an enemy to the other; and in the earth a dwelling shall be yours [2:36]-after you had a place of nearness for dwelling and enjoyment for a while.\ufffd They were enjoying ease but in the end they returned to want. They have recited: When they became poor they clung to poverty hoping for a reward. Even when things were easy for them they hastened to return to that state. At the same time that [God] expelled [Adam] from the garden and caused him to descend to the earth He gave him the glad tidings that He would return him to his [former] condition if his heart were inclined to return. He said \ufffdYet there shall come to you from Me guidance and who- ever follows My guidance no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.\ufffd"
