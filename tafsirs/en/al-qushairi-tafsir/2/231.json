  "text": "When you divorce women and they have reached their term then retain them honorably or set them free honorably; do not retain them in order to hurt [them]; whoever does that has wronged his soul; take not God's verses in mockery and remember God's grace upon you and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things. The verse contains the command to goodly marital relations which means abandoning anger and stubborn bickering with the wife. So either release [her] without being rough min ghayri jafāÌ or practice true companion- ship as it should be carried out ʿalā sharṬi al-wafāÌ."
