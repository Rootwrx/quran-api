  "text": "And when it is said to him \ufffdFear God\ufffd he is seized by vainglory in his sin. So Hell shall be enough for him-how evil a cradling! Those are the people who have been seized by arrogance and who have lost the ability to humbly accept fair criticism; they turn up their noses at accepting the truth. When you enjoin someone [like this] to decency he says \ufffdHow can you say this to someone like me when I am such and such·∏ç\ufffd Then he turns it around and attacks you saying \ufffdYou have more need to be enjoined with decency and forbidden indecency because your condi- tion is such and such...\ufffd If God had granted success to help him or mercy had reached him he would have been granted the favor shown to those who have been guided to seeing their errors and observing their bad traits. And he would not have harbored enmity toward the one who gave him the advice the traces of which remain in the heart for years. God most high said \ufffdSo hell shall be enough for him\ufffd meaning [hell is] the state of his estrangement the darknesses of the lower self and the constriction of choice such that he does not hasten in anything except his [lower] desire. At every moment over and over he succumbs to [this] chastisement and trial. Then he is transported from this chastisement to the greater chastisement. God most high said \ufffdAnd We shall surely make them taste the nearer chastisement before the greater chastisement\ufffd [32:21]."
