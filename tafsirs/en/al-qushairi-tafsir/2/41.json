  "text": "And believe in what I have revealed confirming that which is with you; and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not sell My signs for a small price; and fear Me. The allusion is to the fact that the belief of [the servant] is a combination of clear evidence bayān and his belief [that he reaches] through demonstra- tive proof burhān. The generality of believers believe through demon- strative proof based on reasoning istidlāl while the elite of the believers believe through clear evidence by virtue of being drawn near. The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd has drawn near to them and so they believe in God. The final states of their belief are through eyewitnessing ʿiyān and that is for the elect of the elect. And be not the first to disbelieve in it: \ufffdDo not [be the ones to] introduce disbelief kufr as an ongoing practice sunna\ufffd for surely the responsi- bility of the initiator in what he practices is greater than the responsibility of the imitator in what he follows. And do not sell My signs for a small price: \ufffdDo not prefer your cheap worldly portion ḥaẓẓ over the grandeur of My truth ḥaqq.\ufffd And fear Me: Those who fear His punishment are many but those who are in awe of knowing and seeing Him are rare."
