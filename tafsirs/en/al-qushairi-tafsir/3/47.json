Just as you witnessed the appearance of things contrary to ordinary reality in the provision We gave [to you] likewise We will break with ordinary reality by creating a son without a man having touched [you]. When He decrees a thing that is He desires a ruling ḥukm to come to pass He says to it only: 'Be' and it is. Producing [things] from the beginning and bringing [them] forth are not difficult for Him. When they began to blame her God caused Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd to speak when he was [only] one day old; [he] said \ufffdI have come to you with a sign from your Lord\ufffd [3:49]."
