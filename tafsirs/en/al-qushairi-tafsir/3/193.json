So our Lord forgive us our sins and absolve us of our evil deeds and take us [in death] with the pious. It means \ufffdWe have answered the caller dāʿī but You are the guide hādī so do not leave us to ourselves and do not raise the shadow of your care from us.\ufffd Faith īmān is entering into that which brings security amān and one only has faith in the Real from the Real granting him security. The security of the Real for the servant which is His granting him protection brings about the faith of the servant in the Real which is his affirmation taṣdīq of Him and his deep recognition maʿrifa of Him. And take us [in death] with the pious: They are those chosen for the proper ways of declaring oneness ḥaqāÌiq al-tawḥīd those who stand for God [according] to the conditions of utter devotion sharāÌiṬ al-tafrīd and stay with God by the special characteristics of disengaging [from anything other than Him] khaṣāÌiṣ al-tajrīd."
