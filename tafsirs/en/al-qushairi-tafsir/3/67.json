Abraham \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd was a ḥanīf not bend- ing from the truth not swerving from the law and not stumbling this way and that with every promise of personal gain. He surrendered his wealth his self his son-everything altogether-to the decree of God and [stood in] a state of readiness for His command. and he was never of the idolators."
