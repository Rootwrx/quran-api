It is said that [God] accepted her with a gracious acceptance qabūl ḥasan by making her unique in obedience to Him and entrusting her with that which He entrusts His friends awliyāÌ-so much so that every person of her time was astonished by the excellence ḥusn of that which He had entrusted to her even though she was a girl. It is said that the gracious acceptance was the excellence ḥusn of [God's] care for her in spite of His \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd knowing what would be said about Him because of her for He is not concerned with the shamefulness of the words of enemies. I find blame in passion for you sweet. Out of love of hearing you mentioned let them blame me. Just as it is said: Let anyone who wishes say what he wishes. I do not care! It is also said that the gracious acceptance was His causing her to grow preserved [from sin and error] ʿiṣma until she said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God [19:18]. And made her grow excellently until she stood straight in obedience and preferred His \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd good pleasure in every moment and until the fruit from her was such a person as Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. This was the excellent growth. Zachariah took charge of her and it was part of [God's] gracious acceptance and [His granting her] excellent growth that He made one such as Zachariah \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd among the prophets her guardian and the caretaker and protector of her affairs. God revealed to David \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffdIf you see someone seeking me become a servant to him in raÌayta lī Ṭāliban fa-kun lahu khādiman.\ufffd Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was he found her with provisions. \ufffdO Mary\ufffd he said\ufffdWhence comes this to youḍ\ufffd She said \ufffdFrom God. Truly God provides for whomever He will without reckoning.\ufffd Among the signs of [God's] gracious acceptance was that she could never be found anywhere except in the sanctuary miḥrāb. Whoever dwells and stays where He is worshiped where the sanctuary is-that is a rare and precious servant."
