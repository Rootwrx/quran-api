  "text": "And there is a group of them who twist their tongues with the Book so that you may suppose it as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say \ufffdIt is from God\ufffd yet it is not from God and they speak falsehood against God while they know. This verse alludes to those who are false in their claims on this path Ṭarīqa. They embellish what they say and let loose their tongues concerning what their hearts have no information or verification about. In this they deceive the foolish ordinary people and novices. They imagine that they have attained realization of what they say. In describing them God most high said so that you might suppose it is as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book. In a similar manner the lords of deception and fraud direct their talk to the weak so that the secrets of the people of realities ahl al-ḥaqāÌiq are exposed before them. God most high said and they speak falsehood against God while they know that is they know that they are speaking falsely. Thus the people of falsehood and deception on this way Ṭarīqa speak from hearts qulūb that are ruined and innermost selves asrār that are veiled. We seek refuge in God from deserving wrath."
