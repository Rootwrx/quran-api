  "text": "When God said \ufffdO Jesus I am gathering you and raising you to Me and I am cleansing you of those who disbelieved The allusion in it: \ufffdI am gathering you from yourself seizing you from yourself raising you above the mortal human attributes and purifying you from your own desire irāda completely so that you will act as Our agent muṣarrif through Us and for Us. You will have no free choice ikhtiyār in anything. In its place divine governorship tawallī will descend upon you and stand in for you.\ufffd By this quality the dead were brought to life through the hands [of Jesus]. These were occurrences that could only happen by the divine deliberative power may it be exalted. It is said that He purified his heart from looking to others aghyār and from seeing simulacra and traces al-amthāl wa-l-āthār in all states and phases al-aḥwāl wa-l-aṬwār. and I am setting those who follow you above those who disbelieved until the Day of Resurrection In help nuṣra force qahr and proof ḥujja. His followers-those who have not changed his religion dīn and those who follow his creed ʿaqīda in the declaration of oneness tawḥīd-are believers muÌminūn. They are in the right until the Day of Resurrection and they will be helped [by God] until the Day of Resurrection. Then God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd will judge between them and their enemies on that day. The disbelievers will be in hellfire ammā l-kuffār fa-fī l-jaḥīm and the believers will be in felicity wa-ammā l-muÌminūn fa-fī l-naʿīm. Then to Me shall be your return and I will decide between you as to what you were at variance about."
