  "text": "Say: \ufffdO God Allāhumma Master of the kingdom Allāhumma: Its meaning is \ufffdO God yā Allāh.\ufffd The letter mīm at the end of the word is a substitute for the vocative particle yā. This is a teaching of the Real on how to praise the Real that is \ufffddescribe Me as I should be described in exalted measure\ufffd by saying: \ufffdO Master of the kingdom there is no associate to You no assistant no helper no companion no partner to You in essence no sharer in the kingdom no competitor in creating.\ufffd you give the kingdom to whom You will and seize the kingdom from whom You will; \ufffd... so that we will know that You are the King.\ufffd Among created beings the king is he before whom one is humbled and the kingdom that is seized is the kingdom of those who are haughty toward him. [In a similar manner] created beings are beautified tajammul by abasing themselves tadhallul60 before the Real. Their honor and might ʿizz61 is in their effacement maḥw in Him and their remaining baqāÌ is in their annihilation fanāÌ in Him. You exalt tuʿizzu whom You will by the might ʿizz of Your essence. and You abase tudhillu whom You will; by Your forsaking. You exalt whom you will guiding him to witness You and declare Your oneness and You abase whom You will such that he denies You and is deprived of You. You exalt whom you will with the good fortune of Your drawing near and You abase whom You will by the estrangement of Your turning away. You exalt whom You will by bringing him to intimacy with You and You abase whom You will by estranging him from You.  You exalt whom You will by occupying him with You and You abase whom You will by distracting him from You. You exalt whom You will by eliminating the controlling elements of his lower self and You abase whom You will by giving the upper hand to its clamor. You exalt whom You will by the gleams of the rising Ṭawāliʿ of his intimacy [with You] and You abase whom You will by the night visitors Ṭawāriq of his lower self. You exalt whom You will by expanding basṬ him through You and You abase whom You will by constricting qabḌ him from You."
