Those who had succumbed to discord who had been afflicted by tribulation and seduced by temptation wished for all people what had befallen them. Although [this party of] the people of the scripture wanted the believers to turn from the truth God refused to do other than perfect His light and sent back upon them the evil consequences of their actions."
