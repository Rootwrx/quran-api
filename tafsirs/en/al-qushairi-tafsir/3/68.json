Whereas whims ahwāÌ and blameworthy innovations bidaʿ break up [a group] so that each faction ends up in error the people of truth ahl al-ḥaqq in every era and every time and moment hold to the best proof and will be a single party. They will be those with the best claim [to Abraham] over others. Abraham was a companion of truth ṣāḥib al-ḥaqq.  Whoever professes his religion dīn-as in the example of our Messenger ﷺ and his community-belongs to the religion of Abraham \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd which is the declara- tion of the unity tawḥīd of God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. And God is the Protector walī of the believers because they have been entrusted108 with His religion dīn and they act in harmony with the declaration of His unity tawḥīd. The protecting friendship walāya of God comes with aid ʿawn help nuṣra selection takhṣīṣ and nearness qurba."
