  "text": "You are the best community khayra ummatin brought forth to men enjoining decency and forbidding indecency and believing in God. Because MuṣṬafā ﷺ is the most honored of the prophets his community is the best of communities. Because they are the best of communities they are the most desiring ashwāq of communities. Because they are the most desiring of communities their lives are the shortest of lives. He created them as the last of created beings so that their stay beneath the earth would not be long [before the resurrection]. Their goodness khayriyya has been obtained not by the abundance of their prayers and devotional acts but by the intensity with which He has drawn them near and selected them. Surely the standing of the earlier ones at the door has been long but when the permission comes to enter the later ones will go first. How many reach out to connect to us [yet] their palms receive no share. Enjoining decency and forbidding indecency: Decency is service to the Real and indecency is keeping company with the lower self. Decency is to prefer what is due to the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq and inde- cency is to choose the worldly concerns of the lower self ḥaẓẓ al-nafs. Decency is what brings you close to Him and indecency is what veils you from Him. In the command to decency you are bound to be characterized by decency and in forbidding indecency you are required to turn away from it. Had the people of the scripture believed it would have been better for them; some of them are believers; but most of them are wicked. If everyone had been included under Our command they would have attained true glory in this world and the hereafter but they were kept away from acceptance in the choice already made-most of them were branded with associating partners with God shirk."
