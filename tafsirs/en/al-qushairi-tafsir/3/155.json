  "text": "Truly those of you who turned away the day the two hosts encountered each other-truly Satan made them slip through some of what they had earned; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving Forbearing. This verse alludes to the states of those whose spiritual desire irāda has become meager and their intentions niyyāt weak. Their whims hawā control them and listlessness fatra rules them. Face to face with the coun- sel of others the call of desires and the whispers of satans they put their trust in false speech. They have preferred their whims over piety and stayed back. But they do not find happiness in what they have chosen."
