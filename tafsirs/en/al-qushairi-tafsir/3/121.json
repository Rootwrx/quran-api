He put [the Prophet] ﷺ in charge of assigning the places for battle del- egating His command to him. Then He made manifest in this matter the hidden things of His secret. The axis revolves around His determination and decree fa-l-madār ʿalā qaḌāÌihi wa-qadarihi and the crossing over is by means of what He brings about and chooses wa-l-iʿtibār bi-ijrāÌihi wa-ikhtiyārihi."
