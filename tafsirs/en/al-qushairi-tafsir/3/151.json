  "text": "We will cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers; for that they have associated with God that for which He sent down no authority; their abode shall be the fire; evil is the abode of the evildoers. God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd designated our Prophet ﷺ to cast terror ruʿb from Him into the hearts of His enemies. [The Prophet] \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said: \ufffdI was helped by terror ruʿb.\ufffd He also follows this way sunna with His friends. He puts fear hayba of them into hearts. Fear hayba and force qahr would hardly be right in hearts were it not from Him and used with those who follow falsehood make false claims and misrepresent [the truth]."
