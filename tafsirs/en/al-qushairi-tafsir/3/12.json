He informed them that the speech of the Real will elude them in the future ājil and they will have no delight in living in the present #703;ājil. In the hereafter what they will encounter will be from the severity of the punishment by burning ḥurqa. What [already] afflicts them in this world is absence and separation furqa from God but their faculties of insight have become weak and they do not perceive the pain of [that] punishment."
