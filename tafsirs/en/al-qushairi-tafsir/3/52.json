I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: so fear God and obey me. Surely God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path.\ufffd And when Jesus sensed their disbelief he said \ufffdWho will be my helpers [in the cause of] Godḍ\ufffd The disciples said \ufffdWe will be helpers of God; we believe in God; witness that we have submitted. When the message reached them and they differed-some of them believed him and some of them called him a liar and they were the majority-he came to know that prophecy does not spare one from affliction and the oppression of enemies. So [Jesus] separated his heart from them and held to his goal qaṣd. He said to his people \ufffdWho will be my helpers [in the cause of] God so that they may help me in my exclusive devotion to His true reality and sincere dedication to His goalḍ\ufffd Then those who were touched by the effects of [God's] providence āthār al-ʿināya and chosen through the effects of [divine] selection āthār al-takhṣīṣ said \ufffdWe will be helpers of God; we believe in God; bear witness to us in truth and let nothing come from us that would cast doubt on you.\ufffd"
