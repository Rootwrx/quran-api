But a matter of pre-eternal choosing came suddenly upon you and cast you into an amazing affair its proof sublime its place of descent and occurrence precious.\ufffd confirming what was before it that is verifying His promise to you in the books that came through the prophets [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd]. and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel before as guidance to people and He revealed the criterion. That is to say \ufffdEven though We revealed Our books to the messengers before you We did not omit the remembrance dhikr of you from any book.\ufffd The one who spoke for them said: With me from our absent beloveds are pages. The remembrance of you is their title page. \ufffdJust as We have extended the lights of the prophets through you We have adorned all that We have revealed in remembrances with your remembrance.\ufffd As for those who disbelieve in God's signs for them awaits a terrible chastisement. [The chastisement] is the ignominy of the veil but they do not perceive [this]. God is Precious ʿazīz to His friends Lord of Retribution to His enemies. Everyone seeks what is precious but most do not find it."
