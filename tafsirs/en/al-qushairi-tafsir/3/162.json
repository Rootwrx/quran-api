  "text": "Is he who follows God's beatitude like him who is laden with God's anger whose abode is hellḍ An evil journey's end! They are of degrees before God; and God sees what they do. The one with whom He is well pleased throughout eternity fī azālihi is not equal to the one with whom He is displeased and has abandoned in his states fī aḥwālihi and left him to rely on his own actions ʿalā aʿmālihi oblivious to the witnessing of His favors li-shuhūdi afḌālihi. To seek God's beatitude [one must] separate oneself mufāraqa from what has been prohibited and embrace muʿānaqa what has been commanded. One who divests himself from the prohibited mazjūr and takes heart in embracing what has been commanded maÌmūr has followed God's beatitude riḌwān and has become deserving of the gardens jinān. They are of degrees before God: that is they possess degrees in the decree ḥukm of God-happy are those who have been brought close and wretched are those who have been kept at a distance."
