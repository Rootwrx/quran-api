As for the remainder they worked to create dissension and intensified their enmity. They plotted and schemed against him but God made them taste the evil of their scheming. They imagined that they had crucified and killed Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but that was from their ignorance and confusion. God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd raised Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd as His prophet nabī and His friend walī. Banishment and cursing was the rightful due of his enemies-this was [God's] schem- ing with them. And they schemed; and God schemed; and God is the best of schemers."
