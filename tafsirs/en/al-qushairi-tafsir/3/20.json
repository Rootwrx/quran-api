One who looks at created beings through the eye of [God's] delib- erative power qudra knows that the One who determines for all based on what He has chosen for each is One. Call them publicly when in public and bear witness privately to Our free disposal taṣrīf with regard to them when in private.\ufffd Occupy your tongue by counseling them but empty your heart of their talk and separate your innermost self from witnessing them for We have not charged you with their affairs [but only] with deliver[ing] [the message]. The One who brings about affairs and originates is Us.\ufffd"
