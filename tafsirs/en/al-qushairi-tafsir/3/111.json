The Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd does not give His enemies power over His friends except as much as will prove the sincerity of the flight [of the friends] to God for the reality of their flight firār is nobler before Him than their staying firm qarār. If [the enemies] imagine themselves to be superior to the friends in truth they suffer lowliness and degradation."
