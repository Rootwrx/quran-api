Why did you slay them then if you are truthfulḍ\ufffd They fabricated lies about God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd to excuse their lack of faith saying \ufffdVerily we have been commanded not to believe anyone if we do not see him with our own eyes bringing us an offering. He will offer it to the sky and then a fire will come down to take it.\ufffd God most high said \ufffdsay to them that those who have come before me among the prophets [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd] have brought you what you have demanded of me in offering but you did not believe.  If I were to accede to you in this you would once again not believe.\ufffd Whoever has been kept at a distance by what has already been decreed-if the sun were to speak to him with a clear tongue or the mountains prostrate before him and he were to see all this in a moment of truth deeper knowledge ʿirfān would still not enter his heart and he would only increase in doubt after doubt."
