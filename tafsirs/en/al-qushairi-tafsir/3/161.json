  "text": "It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent; whoever defrauds [others] shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged. He has made the states of the prophets free of the stain of treacherous actions. \ufffdThose to whom We gave the message to bear to Our servants convey it to those who should receive it. They are not concerned with any affair of a close intimate without Our command and they do not hold back harboring malice in passing on anyone's share when We have commanded it.\ufffd Do you not see how [the Prophet] said of Abū Ṭālib \ufffdGo and bury him\ufffd when the Commander of the Believers ʿAlī \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said to him \ufffdYour erring uncle has died\ufffdḍ Do you not see how [Muḥammad] accepted al-Waḥshī the killer of ḥamza when he became a Muslimḍ It is said \ufffdIt was not for any prophet ﷺ to give Our secrets to any but the people to whom they were meant. Rather to each was revealed what they were meant to hear.\ufffd Thus in the tradition \ufffdWe were commanded to reveal yunzil to the people [what is suitable according to] their stations manāzil.\ufffd"
