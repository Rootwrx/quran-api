  "text": "And who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remem- ber God and pray forgiveness for their sins-and who shall forgive sins but Godḍ-and who do not persist in what they did knowing. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein; excellent is the wage of those workers! God most high revealed to Moses \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffdsay to those who do wrong 'Until such time as they do not remember Me I have obliged Myself to remember those who remember Me and My remembrance of those who do wrong is the curse.'\ufffd But He said to those who do wrong in this community [when] they wrong themselves remember God and then says in the last part of the verse: and who shall forgive sins but Godḍ It is said that one's indecency fāḥisha is according to one's state ḥāl and station maqām as is true of one's wrongdoing ẓulm. The transgres- sions mukhālafāt that occur in the minds of the most respected people are like the actions of others. Their speaker said: You are my eye. Is it not right for my eye to lower its eyelids against the dust in the airḍ The crime on the carpet is not like the sin at the door. It is said that they commit an indecency by relying on their [own] actions or they wrong themselves by regarding their [own] states so they seek forgiveness for their sins by declaring themselves free from what they do and do not do knowing that there are no means to Him except through Him. He has purified them of the wrongdoings of their bodily and lower selves. Looking to states and actions when realities appear is wrongdoing. One whom God has purified by the light of solicitude is protected from entanglement in the delusions of people. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord in returning them to witnessing the Lordship and the best possible outcome and fate that was already theirs. And gardens beneath which rivers flow in the future in paradise and in the here and now in the happiness of whispered conversations and the fullness of intimacy."
