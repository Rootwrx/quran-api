Such days We deal out in turn among mankind and that God may know those who believe; and that He may take witnesses from among you and God loves not the evildoers. \ufffdIf a difficulty has come to you for Our sake they have faced something similar before you. They have been given something like what you have been given.\ufffd Those who are patient among them will be victorious fa-man ṣabara minhum ẓafira while those who suffer what comes with annoyance and anger will lose wa man Ḍajira min ḥamli ma laqiya khasira. Days come in turns al-ayām nuwabun and circumstances change wa-l-ḥālāt duwalun and nothing is hidden from the Real."
