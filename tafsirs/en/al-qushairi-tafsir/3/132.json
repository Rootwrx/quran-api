  "text": "And obey God and the Messenger so that you may find mercy. [God] tied obedience to the Messenger ï·º to obedience to Himself. This was to elevate [the Prophet's] rank and to make things easier for the com- munity by handing them over to the company of an individual who was one of them. It is more reassuring to be with one's own kind."
