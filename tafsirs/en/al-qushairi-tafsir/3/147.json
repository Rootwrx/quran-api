They recognized the realities of meaning ḥaqāÌiq al-maʿnā and held their tongues from making any claims. Then they spoke seeking forgiveness and holding to an attitude of shyness just as it has been said: \tHe avoided misdeeds  and then even became afraid of them. \tInstead it was as if his good deeds  were misdeeds."
