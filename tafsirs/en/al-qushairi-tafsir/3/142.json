  "text": "Or did you suppose that you should enter paradise without God know- ing who among you have struggled and who are patient. The wish of those who think they can arrive at a greatly esteemed place without enduring hardships casts them into the abyss of destruction. On the other hand those who recognize the value of [the place] that is sought will have the exertion of their pains made easy for them: Time is not generous with its pleasures for those who are reluctant to throw off restraints. Their speaker said: When youth is on the lookout for the lightning of meanings al-maʿānī the least valuable use of time is the pleasantry of sleep."
