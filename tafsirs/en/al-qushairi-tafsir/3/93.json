  "text": "All food was lawful to the children of Israel save what Israel forbade for himself before the Torah was revealed. Say: \ufffdBring the Torah now and recite it if you are truthful.\ufffd Whoever invents falsehood against God after that those are the evildoers. [God] does not declare things permissible or prohibited in their original state; in [this state] there is no divine ordinance ḥadd regarding them. That is a liberality and kindness from the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd [and this state exists] until such a [time] as a command or a law comes regarding it. God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd has eased the precepts of religious obligation aḥkām al-taklīf for advanced disciples ahl al-nihāya. Their way is to adopt what is easiest in order to perfect what comes to them from the precepts of the hearts aḥkām al-qulūb-surely the difficulties made incumbent on their hearts are harder for them. As for novices ahl al-bidāya the affair is made difficult for them with tasks and litanies-their way is to adopt what is more onerous and difficult [in these areas] so as to empty their hearts of thoughts. Whoever thinks otherwise is in error. This verse also alludes in His saying \ufffdWhoever invents falsehood against God\ufffd to the states of the people of false claims and errors. They absolve themselves and attribute to God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd their false notions hawājis but God is free of these. It is a rare servant who can distinguish between [true] incoming thoughts khawāṬir and false notions hawājis."
