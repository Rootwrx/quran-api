  "text": "But those who fear their Lord-for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; a hospitality from God Himself. That which is with God is better for the pious. \ufffdThe state of those whom we have branded with the ignominy of separation is wretched while the state and intimacy of those whom We have raised in degrees for Our sake is blessed.\ufffd They attain the lasting reward waṣalū ilā l-thawābi al-muqīm and remain in communion and felicity wa-baqū fī l-wuṣlati wa-l-naʿīm. What God has stored away for them is better than what they had hoped for by their own choosing."
