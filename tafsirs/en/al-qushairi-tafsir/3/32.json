He commanded them to obedience and then He said \ufffdBut if they turn their backs\ufffd that is fall short in obedience by opposing [God's command] then God loves not the disbelievers. He did not say \ufffdthe disobedient\ufffd ʿāṣūn but rather \ufffdthe disbelievers\ufffd kāfirūn so the address indicates that He loves the believers even if they are disobedient."
