  "text": "O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers they will make you turn back on your heels and you will revert as losers. Nay but God is your protector and He is the best of helpers. [This] means that if you obey the adversaries they will pull you into their states and cast you into their darknesses. Nay God is your protector your helper the One who aids you Your Master and the One who sets your affairs aright. And He is the best of helpers because He aids you against your lower selves and protects you from their evil. Anyone other than Him adds to your afflictions when they help you because they aid your lower selves against you. And He is the best of helpers because anyone other than Him holds a favor over you in helping you while He rewards you for your asking for His help. It is said that when you ask someone for help you need to give him something of value and then he may or may not help you. But when you ask [God] \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd for help He gives you every kindness and takes no pleasure in not helping you."
