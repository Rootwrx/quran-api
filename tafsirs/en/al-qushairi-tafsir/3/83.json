  "text": "What! Do they desire other than God's religion when to Him has sub- mitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willing or unwillingly and to Him they shall be returnedḍ Anyone who pays attention to what is not real ghayr al-ḥaqīqa or looks to what is other than Him in imagining divinity ilāhiyya is like one who sees a mirage he thinks is water māÌ but when he comes to it he finds only dust habāÌ. The errors of mere suppositions cut one off and confuse; those who descend into them have entered a desolate wadi. To Him has submitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly because of the lights of divine self-disclosure coming down continually to their innermost selves or unwillingly because of the flow of the divine decree overpowering them."
