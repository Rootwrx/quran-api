  "text": "Count not those who were slain in God's way as dead but rather liv- ing with their Lord provided for [by Him]. Rejoicing in what God has given them of His bounty and rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. Life in remembrance of the Real-after the lower selves have been anni- hilated in the good pleasure of the Real-is more perfect than remaining with the blessings of created beings and being veiled from the Real. It is said that the one whose heir is the Living is one who does not disappear and cannot die even if he is killed: Surely bodies have been brought into existence for death so the slaying of a human being in God without doubt is best. And rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind: Those who know that their loved ones are waiting for them while they are in comfort and ease [in the garden] would not take pleasure in living without being with them."
