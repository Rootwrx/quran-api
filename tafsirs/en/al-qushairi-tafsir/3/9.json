Today is the gathering of the lovers on the carpet of approach iqtirāb and tomorrow will be the gathering of all in the place of reward thawāb and punishment ʿiqāb. Today is the gathering of innermost selves asrār for the unveiling of [divine] Majesty jalāl and Beauty jamāl and tomor- row will be the gathering of human beings abshār to witness the terrors ahwāl and endure what has been told of these states aḥwāl."
