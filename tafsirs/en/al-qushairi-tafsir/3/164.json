  "text": "Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a mes- senger from among their own to recite to them His verses and to purify them and to teach them the Book wisdom though before they were in clear error. [God] gave goodness to them in abundance and favored them with gener- ous blessings for He sent someone like MuṣṬafā the leader of mankind ﷺ to them. [The Prophet] taught them their religion and made their proofs clear to them. He belonged to them in every way but they were not grateful for his blessings did not respect his right and were not able to see what he guided them to nor refrain from straying in error-this is a description of his enemies who denied and were arrogant. As for the believers they were adorned with grace in the [divine] choice ikhtiyār. They received the command to hear and obey to the utmost of their capacity iqtidār so they were happy in this world and the hereafter ʿuqbā and became deserving of generosity and nearness zulfa from God."
