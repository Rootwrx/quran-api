And God loves the patient. Those who followed the course in fidelity who stood fast with regard to purity who did not withdraw from the path ṭarīq and who demanded realization of themselves reproaching themselves by restriction and scrutiny - they found the love of the Real s as a legacy for their patience. The Real was what came after for them at the end of their affair since they did not swerve from the required effort or from the protection of the pact and they submitted themselves utterly abandoning the present world. Every one of them was constant and abiding in holding to the pact and staying true to the condition of service and love."
