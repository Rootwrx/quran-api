  "text": "And what afflicted you the day the two hosts encountered was by God's leave and that He might know the believers. And that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said to them \ufffdCome now fight in the way of God or defend [yourselves]\ufffd they said \ufffdIf we knew how to fight we would follow you.\ufffd That day they were nearer to unbelief than to belief saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts. And God knows best what they hide. He lightened the grave calamity met by the believers and possessors of insight on the Day of Uá¸¥ud by saying that the encounter was by God's leave. Surely a trial that afflicts [one] by God's leave is sweeter than honey and more desirable than any blessing. Then He spoke of those who were not sincere comrades how they offered excuses and were lazy. Similarly when the one who is tired wants to break things off he becomes weary of being together and says \ufffdThat was that.\ufffd Saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts: Verily they gave honey to drink [to their enemies] but He plotted to put poison in it for them. And they schemed; and God schemed; and God is the best of schemers [3:54]."
