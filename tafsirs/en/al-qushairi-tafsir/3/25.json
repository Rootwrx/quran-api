Then there will be what will meet them from the reckoning and censure al-ḥisāb wa-l- ʿitāb the torment and punishment al-ʿadhāb wa-l-ʿiqāb and the lack of honoring and approval ʿadam al-ikrām wa-l-ījāb etc. The resurrection of the disbelievers will take place on the Day of Gathering while the resurrection of the lovers takes place in the present moment; to explain this fully would take a long time."
