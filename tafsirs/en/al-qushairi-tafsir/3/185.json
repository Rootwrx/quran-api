  "text": "Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is moved away from the fire and admitted to paradise will have triumphed the life of this world is but the comfort of delusion. That is \ufffdThe cup of death is placed in the palm of every living being. Whoever's soul nafs finds it sweet and agreeable-I bequeath to him the intoxication of ecstatic finding wajd. Whoever swallows it with a frowning face falls into the abyss of rejection radd and is branded by the burning of obstruction ṣadd. Then [there is the Day] of the Resurrection. Whoever is protected from the fire reaches the greatest repose waṣala ilā l-rāḥati al-kubrā and whoever is made to burn in the blazing fire falls into the greatest tribulation waqaʿa fī l-miḥnati al-kubrā.\ufffd The life of this world is but the comfort of delusion because what is coming is nigh."
