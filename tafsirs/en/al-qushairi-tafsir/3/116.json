There is no alternate for them in the situation no substitute for them in the final outcome. They are in a state of loss in the here and now and in the future will be in separation and exile affliction and hurt punishment and rejection: She changed and we changed. Alas to anyone who has sought but did not find a replacement to let him forget."
