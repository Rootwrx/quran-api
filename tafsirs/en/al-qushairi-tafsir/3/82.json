This alludes to whoever abandons [the Prophet's] way sunna or wan- ders [away] from following his path Ṭarīqa after the appearance of [the Prophet's] evidence and the clarity of his miracle. They are those whose condition has become corrupted. They have become deserving of wrath because of their denial and the breaking of their attachment to the divine solicitude."
