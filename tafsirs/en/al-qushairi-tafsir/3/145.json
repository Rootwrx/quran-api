  "text": "It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God a prescribed term. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it; and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it; and We will requite the thankful. The breaths have a set duration for which there is no increase or decrease. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it: The righteous have what comes in the end ʿāqiba and the others have heedlessness ghafla. And whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it: The reward of the hereafter is first of all forgiveness ghufrān then the gardens jinān then beatitude riḌwān. And We will requite the thankful: The requital for thankfulness is thankfulness."
