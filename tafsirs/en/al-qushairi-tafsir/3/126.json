God \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd follows His practice sunna with His friends is such a way that when their intentions niyyāt become weak their spiritual desire irāda low or their hearts are on the verge of listlessness fatra He shows them kindnesses alṬāf and special gifts karāmāt. By these the ties of their deeper knowledge ʿirfān are strengthened and the realities of their cer- tainty yaqīn are confirmed. He sent down this address according to this practice sunna. Then He severed their hearts and innermost selves from anything other than Him entirely saying Victory comes only from God."
