Surely those whose hearts look only to created beings and whose innermost secrets regard only [created beings]-do not think that their punishment will be delayed to the Day of Resurrection. No they are not secure from the punishment in the here and now. What punishment is more intense than being thrown back to created beings khalq and veiled from the Real ḥaqqḍ"
