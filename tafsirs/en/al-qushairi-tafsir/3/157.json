  "text": "And if you are slain in God's way or die forgiveness from God and mercy are better than what they amass. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered. To sacrifice the spirit rūḥ in God is better than life with anything other than God. Returning to God is better for one who knows God than staying behind with anything other than God. Whatever the servant prefers over God is not something that is blessed. If you want there is this world and if you want there is the final outcome. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered: When the destination is to God the journey is pleasant-surely when a journey to Him comes to an end its hardships seem sweeter than honey!"
