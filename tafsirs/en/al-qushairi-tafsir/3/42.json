  "text": "And when the angels said \ufffdO Mary God has preferred you and made you pure; He has preferred you above all women of the worlds.\ufffd It is possible that this was the beginning of a message from the angels to Mary elevating her state. It is possible that she may have heard their words and seen them or that she did not see them but heard them as a voice call- ing out to her: \ufffdGod has preferred you by your being favored and singled out from among your kind and peers and made you pure from what is indecent and sinful with a beautiful immunity and [pure] from having physical contact with men. He has preferred you above all women of the worlds in your time.\ufffd The point of repeating the mention of her being preferred is first \ufffdHe has chosen you through special gifts position and an exalted state\ufffd; and second \ufffdHe has chosen you to bear Jesus \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd without a father and no woman can ever be compared to you until the Day of Resurrection.\ufffd Because of that He said \ufffdabove all women of the worlds.\ufffd"
