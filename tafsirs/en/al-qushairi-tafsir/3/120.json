  "text": "If good fortune befalls you it is evil for them; but if evil befalls you they rejoice thereat. Yet if you endure and fear [God] their guile will not hurt you at all; God encompasses what they do. This verse alludes to those who abandon the path of spiritual desire irāda and return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda. They are not happy to see an aspirant murīd have a breakthrough nafādh; rather they are glad when they see listlessness in a seeker qāṣid. God in His favor and grace perfects His light for the people of His solicitude and He lets the evildoers stray from His path and their distance is punishment. He is not concerned with what comes to them."
