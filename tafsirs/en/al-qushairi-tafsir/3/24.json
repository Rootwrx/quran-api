We have punished them in this world drawing them on by degrees bi-l- istidrāj until they [presume to] determine salvation and the lessening of punishment for themselves but they will come to know the doubling of affliction upon them. They think they understand something but they tell a lie. Those in error think that [what they have said] is a determination ḥukm."
