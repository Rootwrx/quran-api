  "text": "Those that sell God's covenant and their own oaths for a small price there shall be no share for them in the hereafter; and God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them and theirs will be a painful chastisement. Those who prefer their caprice hawāhum over their final outcome ʿuqbāhum and have given priority to their desires munāhum over har- monious agreement with their Protector mawlāhum will have no share in the hereafter. Because they have chosen to seek pleasure in the present they have lost in the two abodes and they remain apart from the Real. The pleasure they sought in worldly things ḥaẓẓ has brought upon them all kinds of tribulations but they are not aware of what has happened to them: God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them. Moreover He will cause them to remain in the punishment beyond the count of time."
