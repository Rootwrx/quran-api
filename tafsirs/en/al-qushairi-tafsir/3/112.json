  "text": "Abasement shall be cast upon them wherever they are found save a rope of God and a rope of the people; they have incurred anger from God and poverty shall be cast upon them; that because they disbelieved in God's signs and slew the prophets without right; that because they disobeyed and used to transgress. The sign of being exiled cannot be hidden the mark of distance cannot be concealed and the evidence of being cut off cannot be veiled. They are in the lowly state of having been banished and abased by rejection. Those who have eyes ulū l-abṣar learn from them while those among the dis- believers and the profligates al-kuffār al-fujjār who are of their kind are deceived by them."
