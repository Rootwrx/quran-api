What do you not comprehendḍ He put a cloak niqāb of possessiveness and a veil ḥijāb of jealousy over His friend \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and severed his connection to all of them after their accusation about him and [thus he] decisively contradicted their confused arguments. How could Abraham \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd belong to the religion of those who came after himḍ This makes no sense."
