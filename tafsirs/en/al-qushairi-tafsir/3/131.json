  "text": "O you who believe do not exact usury doubled and redoubled. And fear God so that you may prosper. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers. [God] has prohibited usury for His servants; this includes loaning one amount and asking twice as much in return. But He has asked you for a loan which He will repay seven hundredfold even up to an infinite repay- ment.This alludes to the magnanimity karam that is not inherent in humans but rather is an attribute of the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers: These words indicate that the believer will not be chastised by [the fire]. If he is chastised by it for a time he will not abide in it."
