  "text": "That is only Satan making fear his friends therefore do not fear them; but fear Me if you are believers. The allusion in [God's] granting power to the calls of Satan in the hearts of [His] friends is [to the test] that confirms their flight to God. This is like a child who has been frightened by one of those things that frighten children and when he is afraid he goes only to his mother. When he comes to her she takes him to herself hugs him and presses her cheek to his. Likewise when the servant is sincere in beseeching God and returns to Him from his oppositional tendencies He takes him under the wing of His closeness and overtakes him with His beautiful kindness."
