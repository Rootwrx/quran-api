  "text": "There has already been a sign for you in two hosts that met; one com- pany fighting in the way of God; and another unbelieving; they saw them twice the like of them; for God confirms with His help whom He will. Surely in that is a lesson for people of vision. When God wants an affair to be accomplished He makes many appear to be few in the eyes of one people and few to appear as many in the eyes of another people. If He covers the inner sight baṣīra of a people the sharpness of their physical eyes abṣār will not benefit them. When He opens the innermost selves of others the obstruction of their faculties of insight baṣāÌir will not harm them."
