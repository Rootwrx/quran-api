  "text": "It is not God's purpose to leave the believers in the state in which you are till He shall distinguish the evil one from the good. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen but God chooses of His messengers whom He will. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard [against evil] then yours shall be a great wage. He has gathered [humankind] together in the here and now with respect to bodies and forms mabānī but has separated them in the deeper realities and meanings maʿānī. Some of them are good Ṭayyib in their natural disposition and some are evil khabīth. Even if their constitutions are mixed they are differentiated in the inner sight of the elect. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen: Surely the secrets of the unseen do not appear to those who are sullied by the pollu- tions of mortal human nature bashariyya. Only the Real \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd possesses knowledge of that which is great and small and He selects whomever He will among His prophets for knowledge of some of His secrets."
