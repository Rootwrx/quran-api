Those whom He made unsuitable for the communion [of lovers] in His prior decree-how shall He draw them near to Him on the carpet of service through His favor nowḍ It is said [with regard to] those whom He made far removed in the pre- eternal decree-when would He bring them nearer to sincerity in [their] actionsḍ God prevails over His affair."
