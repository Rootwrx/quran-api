Said Muqatil ibn Hayyan: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about Imra' al-Qays ibn 'Abis al-Kindi and 'Abdan ibn Ashu' al-Hadrami. It so happened that these two men came to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, with a dispute regarding a piece of land. Imra' al-Qays had the land and 'Abdan was reclaiming it. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse, and the land was given to 'Abdan without a judgment pronouncement\ufffd."
