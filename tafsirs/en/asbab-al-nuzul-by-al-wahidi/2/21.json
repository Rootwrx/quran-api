  "text": "(O mankind! Worship your Lord \ufffd ) [2:21]. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Zahid\u003e Abu \ufffdAli ibn Ahmad al-Faqih\u003e Abu Turab al-Quhustani\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Bishr\u003e Rawh\u003e Shu\ufffdbah\u003e Sufyan al-Thawri\u003e al-A\ufffdmash\u003e Ibrahim\u003e \ufffdAlqamah who said: \ufffdAny revelation which contains the expression (O mankind!) is Meccan while any revelation which contains the expression (O ye who believe!) is Medinan\ufffd. He means to say that the expression (O mankind!) is an address to the people of Mecca while (O ye who believe!) is an address to the people of Medina. Hence, Allah\ufffds saying (O mankind! Worship your Lord \ufffd ) is an address to the Meccan idolaters. The address of the idolaters of Mecca goes on until Allah\ufffds saying: (And give glad tidings\ufffd) [al-Baqarah, 2:25]. This last verse was revealed about the believers. This is because Allah, exalted is He, wanted to mention here the reward of the believers after having mentioned the reward of the disbelievers in His saying: (\ufffd the fire prepared for the disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones) [al-Baqarah, 2:24]."
