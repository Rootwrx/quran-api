  "text": "(Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of Allah...) [2:158]. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Zahid informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli ibn Abi Bakr al-Faqih\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-\ufffdAziz\u003e Mus\ufffdab ibn \ufffdAbd Allah al-Zubayri\u003e Malik\u003e Hisham\u003e his father\u003e \ufffdA\ufffdishah who said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about the Helpers. They used to make a pilgrimage to Manat which was close to Qudayd. They also used to avoid going between al-Safa and al-Marwah. When Islam came, they asked Allah\ufffds Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, about this, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. This is narrated by Bukhari from \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Yusuf from Malik. Abu Bakr al-Tamimi informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Shaykh al-Hafiz [al-Asfahani]\u003e Abu Yahya al-Razi\u003e Sahl al-\ufffdAskari\u003e Yahya and \ufffdAbd al-Rahman\u003e Hisham\u003e his father\u003e \ufffdA\ufffdishah who said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about a group of people from the Helpers. Before Islam, they used to make pilgrimage to Manat and were forbidden from going between al-Safa and al-Marwah. When they went to pilgrimage with Allah\ufffds Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, they mentioned this to him. And so Allah revealed this verse\ufffd. This is narrated by Muslim from the report of Abu Bakr\u003e Ibn Abi Shaybah\u003e Abu Usamah\u003e Hisham\u003e his father\u003e \ufffdA\ufffdishah. Said Anas ibn Malik: \ufffdWe disliked going in between al-Safa and al-Marwah, because they were the shrines of Quraysh in the pre-Islamic period, and so we abandoned them in Islam. Then Allah revealed this verse\ufffd. Said \ufffdUmar ibn Hubshi: \ufffdI asked Ibn \ufffdUmar about this verse and he said: \ufffdGo to Ibn \ufffdAbbas and ask him\ufffd. The latter said: \ufffdThere was on al-Safa an idol in the form of a man called Isaf, and on al-Marwah an idol in the form of a woman called Na\ufffdilah. The people of the Book claimed that these two had committed adultery in the Ka\ufffdbah and as a punishment Allah turned them into two stones which were placed on al-Safa and al-Marwah so that people can take heed. But after a long time had passed, they were worshipped instead of Allah, exalted is He. Whenever the people of the pre-Islamic period went in between them, they stroked the two idols. When Islam came and the idols were destroyed, the Muslims disliked going between al-Safa and al-Marwah because of these two idols."
