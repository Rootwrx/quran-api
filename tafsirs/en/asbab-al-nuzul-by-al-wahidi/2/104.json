  "text": "(O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): \ufffdListen to us\ufffd [ra\ufffdina] \ufffd) [2:104]. Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas according to the narration of \ufffdAta\ufffd: \ufffdThis is because the Arabs used to employ this expression [ra\ufffdina], so when the Jews heard them using it with the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, they liked it. This same expression in the parlance of the Jews had the connotation of vile abusive language. They said: \ufffdBefore, we used to abuse Muhammad (s)ecretly. Now, you can abuse him openly because this expression is used in their speech\ufffd. Therefore, they used to come to Allah\ufffds Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and say: \ufffdO Muhammad! ra\ufffdina\ufffd, and the they would laugh. A man from the Helpers \ufffd Sa\ufffdd ibn \ufffdUbadah who understood well the language of the Jews\ufffdunderstood the reason. He said to them: \ufffdO enemies of Allah! May Allah\ufffds curse be on you. By Him in Whose Hand is Muhammad\ufffds soul, I will cut the head of any man of you who utters this expression\ufffd. They objected, saying: \ufffdBut do you not use the same expression with him?\ufffd And therefore Allah, exalted is He, revealed: (O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): \ufffdListen to us\ufffd [ra\ufffdina]) but say \ufffdLook upon us\ufffd [unzurna]\ufffd)."
