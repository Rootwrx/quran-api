He said: \ufffdI had given one of my sisters to a certain man who went on to divorce her. When my sister\ufffds waiting period was over, the same man came back asking for my sister\ufffds hand. I said to him: \ufffdI had given my sister to you as a bride; I married her to you and honoured you, but you went on to divorce her. No, by Allah, you will never go back to her!\ufffd He said: \ufffdthe man was not bad, and the woman wanted to go back to him. Then Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed this verse. I said: I will do it now, O Messenger of Allah\ufffd. And he gave his sister in marriage to this man\ufffd \ufffd. This was narrated by Bukhari from Ahmad ibn Hafs. Al-Hakim Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mansuri informed us\u003e \ufffdAli ibn \ufffdUmar ibn Mahdi\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAmr ibn al-Bukhturi\u003e Yahya ibn Ja\ufffdfar\u003e Abu \ufffdAmir al-\ufffdUqadi\u003e \ufffdAbbad ibn Rashid\u003e al-Hasan\u003e Ma\ufffdqil ibn Yasar who said: \ufffdI had a sister whose hand I always decline to give until a cousin of mine proposed to her. I gave her to him in marriage and they remained married as long as Allah willed. He then divorced her a revocable divorce, waited until her waiting period elapsed and came forward, along with other suitors, to ask for her hand. I said to him: \ufffdI had refused to marry her off to other people and, instead, gave her to you in marriage. You chose to divorce her a revocable divorce and waited until the waiting period elapsed. Now that her hand is asked for, you come to me asking to marry her."
