As for 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, he went and gave the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, four thousand silver coins to distribute in charity. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf said to him: 'I have eight thousand silver coins; I have kept four thousand for me and my family and I loan these four thousands to my Lord'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: 'May Allah bless for you that which you have kept and that which you have given'. And as for 'Uthman, may Allah be well pleased with him, he said: 'Upon me is the equipment of anyone who has no equipment for the Battle of Tabuk'. And so he equipped the Muslims with one thousand camels with their hunches and saddle blankets and also gave to charity a well that he owned. This verse was revealed about him\ufffd. Said Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: \ufffdI saw the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, raising his hand and praying for 'Uthman, saying: 'O Lord! Be well pleased with 'Uthman ibn 'Affan for I am well pleased with him'. His hands remained raised until the break of dawn. Allah, exalted is He, revealed about him (Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah\ufffd)\ufffd."
