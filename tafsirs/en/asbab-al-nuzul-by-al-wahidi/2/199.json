  "text": "(Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward) [2:199]. Al-Tamimi informed through the chain of transmission mentioned above from Yahya ibn Hisham ibn \ufffdUrwa\u003e his father\u003e \ufffdA\ufffdishah that she said: \ufffdThe Arabs used to hasten onward from \ufffdArafat while the Quraysh and those who followed their religion used to hasten onward from Jam\ufffd in the Sacred Precinct. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward)\ufffd. Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Sarkhasi\u003e Abu Bakr ibn Khaythamah\u003e Hamid ibn Yahya\u003e Sufyan ibn \ufffdUyaynah\u003e \ufffdAmr ibn Dinar\u003e Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut\ufffdim\u003e his father that he said: \ufffdI lost one of my camels on the day of \ufffdArafah and I went to look for it when I saw the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, standing with people at \ufffdArafah. I said: \ufffdHe is from the Hums, what is he doing here?\ufffd Abu Sufyan said: \ufffdthe Ahmas [sing of Hums] is someone who is very strict about and observant of his religion\ufffd. This is because the Quraysh used to be called the Hums but the devil led them astray by whispering to them: \ufffdIf you exalt other than your Sacred Precinct, other people will belittle your Sacred Precinct\ufffd. And so they did not hasten onward from the Sacred Precinct but rather stand at al-Muzdalifah. Upon the advent of Islam, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed: (Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward), i.e. from \ufffdArafah. This was narrated by Muslim\u003e \ufffdAmr al-Naqid\u003e Ibn \ufffdUyaynah."
