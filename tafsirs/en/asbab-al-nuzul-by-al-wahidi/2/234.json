This man had children: men and women, and he also had with him his parents and wife. This man later died in Medina and his matter was reported to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, gave reasonably to the man\ufffds parents and children but did not give anything to his wife. However, he ordered them to spend on her from her husband\ufffds bequest for a year\ufffd."
