  "text": "(It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast...) [2:187]. According to the report of al-Walibi, Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdThis is because after the nightfall (\ufffdIsha\ufffd) prayer during Ramadan, the Muslims were forbidden to have food or sex until the following night. But some Muslims, among whom were \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab, complained to Allah\ufffds Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, about this. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. Abu Bakr al-Asfahani informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn \ufffdUthman al-\ufffdAskari\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Za\ufffdidah\u003e his father and others\u003e Abu Ishaq\u003e al-Bara\ufffd ibn \ufffdAzib who said: \ufffdAfter breaking their fast, the Muslims used to be allowed to eat, drink and have sexual intercourse for as long as they did not sleep. Once they went to sleep, they were forbidden to do all these things until the following day when they broke their fast. Qays ibn Sirma al-Ansari went to his wife at the time of breaking the fast. His wife went out to get something [to eat]. While he was waiting, he fell asleep [and therefore could not eat until the following night]. The following day he fainted in the middle of the day. \ufffdUmar ibn al-Khattab also had sexual intercourse with his wife after he found her sleeping. He mentioned what had happened to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and the verse was (is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast\ufffd) was revealed, up to Allah\ufffds saying (\ufffdof the dawn.). The Muslims were very happy with this\ufffd. Abu \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hamid\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Shaybani\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman al-Daghuli\u003e al-Za\ufffdfarani\u003e Shababah\u003e Isra\ufffdil\u003e Abu Ishaq\u003e al-Bara\ufffd who said: \ufffdThe Companions of Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, when one of them was fasting and was still sleeping at the advent of the time of breaking the fast, he was not allowed to eat that night or the following day until the advent of the time of breaking the fast of the following day. Qays ibn Sirma al-Ansari was fasting. When the time of breaking fast came, he went to his wife and asked her: \ufffdDo you have any food?\ufffd She said: \ufffdNo! But I will go and find something for you\ufffd."
