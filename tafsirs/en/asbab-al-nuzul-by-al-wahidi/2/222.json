  "text": "(They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation\ufffd.) [2:222]. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja'far informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Zakariyya\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Daghuli\u003e Muhammad ibn Mishkan\u003e Hayyan\u003e Hammad\u003e Thabit\u003e Anas who said: \ufffdThe Jews used to banish women in their menstruation out of the house and refrain from eating, drinking and having sex with them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was asked about this, and as a response Allah, exalted is He, revealed (They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is an illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed\ufffd)\ufffd. This was narrated by Muslim from Zuhayr ibn Harb from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi from Hammad. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn 'Umar al-Khashshab informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr ibn Hamdan\u003e Abu 'Imran Musa ibn al-'Abbas al-Juwayni\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Ubayd Allah ibn Yazid al-Qarduwani al-Harrani\u003e his father\u003e Sabiq ibn 'Abd Allah al-Raqqi\u003e Khusayf\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah\u003e the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, that he said regarding (They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation): \ufffdThe Jews used to say: 'Whoever penetrates his wife from a back position, the child born to them as a result of this intercourse would be born cross-eyed'. Because of this, the women of the Helpers did not let their husbands penetrate them from a back position. A group of them went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and asked him about having sex with their wives while in their period of menstruation and also about the claim of the Jews. Allah, glorious and exalted is He, revealed therefore (They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is an illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed. And when they have purified themselves\ufffd), i.e. by performing a major ritual ablution (And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you) i.e. from the front (Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth those who have a care for cleanness. Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will\ufffd) because it is in the tilth that the child will grow and it is from there that it will come out\ufffd."
