  "text": "(Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude) [2:26]. Ibn 'Abbas said, according to the report of Abu Salih: \ufffdWhen Allah, exalted is He, coined these two similitudes for the hypocrites - he means Allah's sayings (Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire\ufffd) [2:17] and (Or like a rainstorm from the sky\ufffd.) [2:19] - they said: 'Allah is too exalted and sublime to coin similitudes'. Hence, Allah revealed this verse\ufffd. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said: \ufffdWhen Allah mentioned gnats and spiders in His Book and used them to coin similitudes for the disbelievers, the Jews laughed and said: 'this does not resemble Allah's speech', and so Allah revealed this verse\ufffd. Ahmad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Ishaq al-Hafiz in his epistle informed us\u003e Sulayman ibn Ayyub al-Tabarani\u003e Bakr ibn Sahl\u003e 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Sa'id\u003e Musa ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e 'Ata'\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding Allah's saying (Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude): \ufffdThis is because Allah mentioned the deities of the idolaters, saying: (And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it from him) [22:73]. He also mentioned the scheme of the deities and compared it to cobweb. Upon hearing this, they said: 'See how Allah mentions gnats and spiders in the Qur'an revealed to Muhammad; what is the use of this?' And so Allah revealed this\ufffd."
