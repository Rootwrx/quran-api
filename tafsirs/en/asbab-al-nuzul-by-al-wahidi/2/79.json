  "text": "(Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, \ufffdThis is from Allah\ufffd\ufffd) [2:79]. This was revealed about those who had changed the description of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and altered his traits. Al-Kalbi mentioned, through the above-mentioned chain of transmission: \ufffdThey had changed the description of Allah\ufffds Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, in their Scripture. They made him white and tall while the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was brown and of medium height. They had said to their followers and companions: \ufffdLook at the description of the prophet who will be sent at the end of time; his description does not match that of this [man]\ufffd. The Jewish rabbis and doctors used to gain some worldly benefits from the Jewish people and so they were afraid of losing this gain if they were ever to show the real description. It is for this reason that they had changed it\ufffd."
