But Allah\ufffds Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, liked to be directed in prayer toward the Ka\ufffdbah. Allah, exalted is He, revealed (We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven) up to the end of the verse [2:144]\ufffd. The foolish among people, who are none other than the Jews, said: (What hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed?)
