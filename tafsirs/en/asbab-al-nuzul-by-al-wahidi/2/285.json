The Imam Abu Mansur \ufffdAbd al-Qahir ibn Tahir informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn \ufffdAli ibn Ziyad\u003e Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Bushanji\u003e Umayyah ibn Bistam\u003e Yazid ibn Zuray\ufffd\u003e Rawh ibn al-Qasim\u003e al-\ufffdAla\ufffd\u003e his father\u003e Abu Hurayrah who said: \ufffdWhen Allah, exalted is He, revealed to His Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, the verse (\ufffd and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide, Allah will bring you to account for it\ufffd) [2:284], the prophetic Companions found this hard to cope with. They went to the Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdWe have been entrusted with works that we can not bear: the prayer, fasting, Jihad, almsgiving; and now Allah has revealed to you this verse which we are not able to bear\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them: \ufffdDo you want to say as the people of the two Scriptures said before you? \ufffd the narrator said: I think he quoted the verse (We hear and we rebel!) [2:93] \ufffd Say, rather, (We hear, and we obey. (Grant us) Thy forgiveness, our Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying)\ufffd. When they heard this, they did not answer. Allah revealed after this (The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord\ufffd) the whole verse, and Allah abrogated it by His revelation (Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope\ufffd) [2:286] to the end of the verse\ufffd. This report was narrated by Muslim from Umayyah ibn Bistam. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us\u003e his father\u003e Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn \ufffdUmar and Yusuf ibn Musa\u003e Waki\ufffd\u003e Sufyan\u003e Adam ibn Sulayman who said: \ufffdI heard Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr relating from Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdWhen the verse (\ufffd and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide, Allah will bring you to account for it\ufffd) was revealed, objection crept into the hearts of the prophetic Companions as it never did before. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them: Say, \ufffdwe hear and we obey\ufffd. Allah then revealed (Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope), up to His saying (or miss the mark) upon which he said: You did."
