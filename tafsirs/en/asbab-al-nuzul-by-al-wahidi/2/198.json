Mansur ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Bazzar informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Hiri\u003e Shu'ayb ibn 'Ali al-Zarra'\u003e 'Isa ibn Musawir\u003e Marwan ibn Mu'awiyah al-Fazari\u003e al-'Ala' ibn al-Musayyab\u003e Abu Umamah al-Taymi who said: \ufffdI said to Ibn 'Umar: 'We hire our beasts to the pilgrims and walk with them, and there are some people who claim that our pilgrimage is invalid'. He said: 'Do you not chant: here we are, O Allah, here we are? Do you not go around the Ka'bah? Do you not go in between the Safa and Marwah? Do you not do this? And do you not do that?' I said: 'Indeed, we do!' Ibn 'Umar said: 'A man did ask the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, about the same thing you asked, and he could not answer him until the verse (It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading)\ufffd) was revealed. When this verse was revealed, he called the man and recited it to him. He said: you are the real pilgrims' \ufffd. Abu Bakr al-Tamimi informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Khushnam\u003e Abu Yahya al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e Yahya ibn Abi Za'idah\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e 'Amr ibn Dinar\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdDhu'l-Majaz and 'Ukaz used to be places of trade in the pre-Islamic era. It is as if people disliked this to be so upon the advent of Islam, that is until the verse (It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading)\ufffd) was revealed regarding the season of Pilgrimage\ufffd. Mujahid also related that Ibn 'Abbas said: \ufffdPeople used to avoid trade and buying and selling during the Pilgrimage. They used to say: 'These are days for the remembrance of Allah, glorious and exalted is He'. And so Allah revealed (It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading)\ufffd), meaning: do engage in trade\ufffd."
