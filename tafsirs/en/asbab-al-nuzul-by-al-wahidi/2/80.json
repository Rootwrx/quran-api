Isma'il ibn Abi al-Qasim al-Sufi informed us\u003e Abu'l-Husayn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Hamid al-'Attar\u003e Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Abd al-Jabbar\u003e Abu'l-Qasim 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd al-Zuhri\u003e his father and paternal uncle\u003e their father\u003e Ibn Ishaq\u003e Muhammad ibn Abi Muhammad\u003e 'Ikrima\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdAllah's Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, came to Medina and found the Jews saying: 'This worldly life will last seven thousand years. And for every one thousand years of the days of this worldly life people will be tormented in hell fire for one day of the days of the Afterlife. Thus, the torment will last for only seven days'. Allah, exalted is He, revealed concerning this saying: (And they say: The Fire (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain number of days)\ufffd. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tamimi informed us\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Hayyan\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Razi\u003e Sahl ibn 'Uthman\u003e Marwan ibn Mu'awiyah\u003e Juwaybir\u003e al-Dahhak\u003e Ibn 'Abbas said concerning the verse (And they say: The Fire (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain number of days): \ufffdThe people of the Book found out that from one end of hell fire to the other a journey of forty years was needed, and, therefore, they said: 'We shall not be tormented in hell fire except for the period of time specified in the Torah'. And so they proceeded in their torment until they reached Saqar wherein is the tree of Zaqqum until the certain number of days which they mentioned came to an end. The denizens of hell fire then said to them: 'you claimed you will not be tormented in hell fire except for a certain number of days. Well, those certain number of days has elapsed, but eternity remains' \ufffd."
