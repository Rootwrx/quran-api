Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah and a group of people from the Quraysh who had said to the Prophet: \ufffdO Muhammad! Turn al-Safa into gold, expand for us the land of Mecca and make rivers gush out throughout it \ufffd if you do this, we will believe in you!\ufffd Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse as a response to them\ufffd. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan also said: \ufffdThe Jews and other idolaters put their requests to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace; some said: \ufffdBring us an entire book from heaven as did Moses bring the Torah\ufffd; some \ufffd \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi \ufffd said: \ufffdBring us a book from heaven which reads: This is from the Lord of the Worlds to Ibn Abi Umayyah: know that I have sent Muhammad to mankind\ufffd; others said: \ufffdWe shall not believe in you until you bring the angels as guarantors\ufffd. Hence, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
