Abu Nu'aym al-Asfahani informed me, in one of the narration that he authorized me to narrate from him\u003e Sulayman ibn Ahmad\u003e Bakr ibn Sahl\u003e 'Abd al-Ghaniyy ibn Sa'id\u003e Musa ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-San'ani\u003e Ibn Jurayj\u003e 'Ata'\u003e ibn 'Abbas that he said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Salam and his followers. This is because when they believed in the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, they observed the laws that he brought forth while still observing the laws of Moses. They observed the Sabbath and shunned the meat and milk of camels after they embraced Islam. Some Muslims reproached them for this but they defended themselves by saying that they could observe both. They said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: 'The Torah is the Book of Allah, so let us observe its teachings'. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse\ufffd."
