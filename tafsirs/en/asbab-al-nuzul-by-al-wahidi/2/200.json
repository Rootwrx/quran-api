Said Mujahid: \ufffdDuring the season of pilgrimage, in the pre-Islamic era, people remembered their fathers, events and lineages and, then, boasted about them to each other. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye remember your fathers\ufffd)\ufffd. Al-Hasan said: \ufffdUpon relating something or speaking, the Bedouins used to say: \ufffdBy your father, they verily did this and that\ufffd, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
