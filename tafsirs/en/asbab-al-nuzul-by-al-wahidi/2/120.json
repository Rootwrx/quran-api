  "text": "(And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians\ufffd) [2:120]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThey used to ask the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, for truce, giving him the impression that if he were to accord them truce and respite they will follow him and believe in him. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd. But Ibn \ufffdAbbas said: \ufffdThis was revealed regarding the qiblah. This is because the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najran were in the hope that the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, will remain praying to their qiblah. When Allah directed him to pray toward the Ka\ufffdbah, they were disappointed and despaired of him ever following their religion. And so Allah revealed this verse\ufffd."
