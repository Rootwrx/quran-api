The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan have mentioned the reason why Ibrahim asked his Lord to show him how He brings the dead back to life. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar informed us\u003e Shu\ufffdbah ibn Muhammad\u003e Makki ibn \ufffdAbdan\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Azhar\u003e Ruh\u003e Sa\ufffdid \u003e Qatadah who said: \ufffdIt was mentioned to us that Ibrahim passed by a corpse of a beast which was surrounded by beasts of the sea and of the land, and so he said: \ufffdO Allah! Show me how you bring the dead back to life!\ufffd \ufffd Also, al-Hasan, \ufffdAta\ufffd al-Khurasani, al-Dahhak and Ibn Jurayj said: \ufffdIbrahim, Allah\ufffds intimate friend, passed by a dead donkey lying on seashore (\ufffdAta\ufffd said this was rather Tiberias lake). He saw the carrion surrounded by beasts of the water and of the land. When the water rose up, the fish and the beasts of the sea came forward and ate of it, and whatever fell of the carrion was swept away by water; and when the sea ebbed away, wild animals went forward and ate of it, and whatever fell of the carrion became dust. When the wild animals went away, birds came forward and ate of the carrion, and whatever fell from them, the wind scattered it away in the air. Ibrahim was amazed when he saw this. He said: \ufffdO Lord! I know very well that you will gather its parts, please show me how you bring it to life, so that I can see it with my own eyes\ufffd \ufffd. Said Ibn Zayd: \ufffdIbrahim passed by a dead whale, half of which was in the sea and half in the land. The part which was in the sea was eaten up by the beasts of the sea while the part which was in the land was eaten up by the beasts of the land. Satan the evil one whispered to him: \ufffdHow is Allah going to gather the different parts of this from the bellies of all these beasts?\ufffd Ibrahim said: (My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe? Abraham said: Yea, but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease) by dispelling Satan\ufffds whispering\ufffd."
