Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja\ufffdfar informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAmr ibn Hamdan\u003e Abu Ya\ufffdla\u003e Ahmad ibn al-Akhnas\u003e Muhammad ibn Fudayl\u003e al-Kalbi\u003e Abu Salih\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdWe heard, and Allah knows best, that this verse was revealed about the Banu \ufffdAmr ibn \ufffdUmayr ibn \ufffdAwf, from Thaqif, and Banu\ufffdl-Mughirah, from Banu Makhzum, because Banu\ufffdl-Mughirah used to borrow from Thaqif money with usury. When Allah, exalted is He, made His Messenger conquer Mecca, He abolished all usurious transactions. Banu \ufffdAmr ibn \ufffdUmayr and Banu\ufffdl-Mughirah, then, went to see \ufffdAttab ibn Usayd who was in Mecca. Banu\ufffdl-Mughirah said: \ufffdWhy are we the most wretched of all people? Usury has been cancelled from amongst people, but we still pay it\ufffd. The Banu \ufffdAmr ibn \ufffdUmayr said: \ufffdThe treaty that we have stipulates that usury is paid to us\ufffd. \ufffdAttab sent a letter to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, regarding this matter. Then this verse and the verse after it (And if ye do not, then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His messenger\ufffd) were revealed. The Banu \ufffdAmr knew that they would not be paid usury when the result involves a war from Allah and His Messenger. Allah, exalted is He, says: (And if ye repent, then ye have your principal (without interest)) such that you would not take more (Wrong not, and ye shall not be wronged) by being given less than your capital\ufffd. \ufffdAta\ufffd and \ufffdIkrimah also said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about al-\ufffdAbbas ibn \ufffdAbd al-Muttalib and \ufffdUthman ibn \ufffdAffan who had lent someone dates. When it was time for the collection of the dates, the owner of the dates said to them: \ufffdIf you take all of what is due to you what remains will not be enough for me and my dependents. Why do you not take half of what is due to you and I will double the interest that was initially agreed?\ufffd They both agreed. When the term was due, they both asked the man to pay what was agreed. This reached the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and he warned them against going ahead with it."
