Abu Ibrahim Isma'il ibn Ibrahim al-Nasrabadhi informed us\u003e 'Amr ibn Nujayd\u003e Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Khalil\u003e Hisham ibn 'Ammar\u003e Muhammad ibn Shu'ayb\u003e Ibn Mahdi\u003e Yazid ibn 'Abd Allah\u003e 'Arib\u003e his father\u003e his grandfather\u003e the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, who said: \ufffdThis verse (Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly, verily their reward is with their Lord) was revealed about the owners of horses\ufffd. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, also said: \ufffdThe devils will not bewitch anyone who has in his house a noble horse\ufffd. This is also the opinion of Abu Umamah, Abu'l-Darda', Makhul, al-Awza'i and Rabah ibn Zayd. They said: \ufffdThis refers to those who tie their horses for the sake of Allah, they spend on them by night and day, secretly and in the open. The verse was revealed about those who do not keep horses for pride or as a guarantee for debts which are deemed impossible to pay back\ufffd. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Tha'labi informed us\u003e al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Dinawari\u003e 'Umar ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Nahrawani\u003e 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Mahrawayh al-Qazwini\u003e 'Ali ibn Dawud al-Qantari\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn Salih\u003e Abu Shurayh\u003e Qays ibn al-Hajjaj\u003e Hanash ibn 'Abd Allah al-San'ani that Ibn 'Abbas said concerning the verse (Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly\ufffd): \ufffdThis refers to the fodder given to horses\ufffd. The correctness of this is evidenced by the report which narrated to us\u003e Abu Ishaq al-Muqri'\u003e Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn 'Abdus\u003e Abu'l-'Abbas 'Abd Allah ibn Ya'qub al-Kirmani\u003e Muhammad ibn Zakariyya al-Kirmani\u003e Waki'\u003e 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Bahram\u003e Shahr ibn Hawshab\u003e Asma' bint Yazid who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdWhoever ties a horse for the sake of Allah, and spends on it seeking nothing but the pleasure of Allah, that horse's satiety and hunger, drink and thirst, urine and dung will all be in his balance of good deeds on the Day of Judgement\ufffd. Abu Ishaq also informed us\u003e Abu 'Amr al-Furati\u003e Abu Musa 'Imran ibn Musa\u003e Sa'id ibn 'Uthman al-Jazari\u003e Faris ibn 'Umar\u003e Salih ibn Muhammad\u003e Sulayman ibn 'Amr\u003e 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Yazid\u003e Makhul\u003e Jabir who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: \ufffdThe one who spends on his horse for the sake of Allah is like the one who extends his hand to give in charity\ufffd."
