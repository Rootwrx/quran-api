Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja'far al-Muzakki informed us\u003e Zahir ibn Ahmad\u003e al-Husayn ibn Muhammad ibn Mus'ab\u003e Yahya ibn Hakim\u003e Ibn Abi 'Adiyy\u003e Shu'bah\u003e Abu Bishr\u003e Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said: \ufffdThe women of the Helpers whose boys always died in infancy used to vow to bring up their boys as Jews if they were to live. When the Banu'l-Nadir were driven out, they had among them children of the Helpers. The Helpers said: 'We will not leave our children!' Upon which Allah, exalted is He, revealed (There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error \ufffd)\ufffd. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Fadl informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn Ya'qub\u003e Ibrahim ibn Marzuq\u003e Wahb ibn Jarir\u003e Shu'bah\u003e Abu Bishr\u003e Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding the saying of Allah, exalted is He, (There is no compulsion in religion\ufffd): \ufffdThe woman of the Helpers whose boys never survived used to vow that if a boy of hers survived, she would raise him as a Jew. When the Banu'l-Nadir were driven out of Medina they had among them children of the Helpers. The Helpers said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Our Children!' Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed (There is no compulsion in religion\ufffd)\ufffd. Sa'id ibn Jubayr said: \ufffdThose who wished to leave with the Jews did leave, and those who wished to embrace Islam embraced Islam\ufffd. Said Mujahid: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about a man of the Helpers who had a black boy called Subayh whom he used to coerce to become Muslim\ufffd. Al-Suddi said: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about a man from the Helpers called Abu'l-Husayn. This man had two sons. It happened that some traders from Syria came to Medina to sell oil. When the traders were about to leave Medina, the two sons of Abu'l-Husayn called them to embrace Christianity. These traders converted to Christianity and then left Medina. Abu'l-Husayn informed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, of what had happened. He asked him to summon his two sons. But then Allah, exalted is He, revealed (There is no compulsion in religion\ufffd). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'May Allah banish both of them. They are the first to disbelieve'."
