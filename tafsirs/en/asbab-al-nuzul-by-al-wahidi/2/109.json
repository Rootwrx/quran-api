Said Ibn \ufffdAbbas: \ufffdThis verse was revealed about a group of Jews who said to the Muslims after the Battle of Uhud: \ufffdCould you not see what has happened to you? If you were truly following the truth, you would not have been defeated. Revert, therefore, to our religion; it is far better for you\ufffd \ufffd. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us\u003eMuhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn al-Fadl\u003e Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Muhammad ibn Yahya\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Yaman\u003e Shu\ufffdayb\u003e al-Zuhri\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Rahman ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Ka\ufffdb ibn Malik\u003e his father who reported that Ka\ufffdb al-Ashraf the Jew was a poet who used his poetry to satirize the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and incite the disbelievers of Quraysh against him. The idolaters and Jews of Medina also used to seriously harm the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and his Companions upon their arrival to Medina. Allah, exalted is He, commanded his Prophet to endure all that and to forgive them. And it is about them that was revealed (Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief\ufffd) up to His saying (Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command\ufffd)."
