Abu Mansur \ufffdAbd al-Qahir ibn Tahir informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Hasan Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Sarraj\u003e al-Hasan ibn al-Muthanna ibn Mu\ufffdadh\u003e Abu Hudhayfah Musa ibn Mas\ufffdud\u003e Sufyan al-Thawri\u003e Salim al-Aftas\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr who said: \ufffdWhen the verse (Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, they do but swallow fire into their bellies\ufffd) [4:10] people rushed to separate their own wealth from the wealth of orphans they were in charge of. Then Allah revealed (And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs, then (they are) your brothers) upon which they mixed their own wealth with the wealth of orphans\ufffd. Sa\ufffdid ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Zahid informed us\u003e Abu \ufffdAli al-Faqih\u003e \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Baghawi\u003e \ufffdUthman ibn Abi Shaybah\u003e Jarir\u003e \ufffdAta\ufffd ibn al-Sa\ufffdib\u003e Sa\ufffdid ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who said: \ufffdWhen Allah, exalted is He, revealed the verse (And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better\ufffd), whoever had an orphan\ufffds wealth with him proceeded to isolate his food and drink from the orphan\ufffds food and drink, and whatever remained of the orphan\ufffds food was kept aside until the orphan would use it or it gets bad; and this was a source of anguish for people. They went and mentioned this to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and as a response, Allah, glorified and exalted, revealed (And they question thee concerning orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best), by mixing their food and drink with their food and drink\ufffd."
