  "text": "(Unto Allah belong the East and the West\ufffd) [2:115]. There is a scholarly disagreement regarding the occasion of revelation of this Qur'anic verse. Abu Mansur al-Mansuri informed us\u003e al-Hafiz 'Ali ibn 'Umar\u003e Abu Muhammad Isma'il ibn 'Ali\u003e al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Shabib al-'Umari\u003e Ahmad ibn 'Ubayd Allah ibn al-Hasan al-'Anbari who said: \ufffdI found written in my father's epistle: 'Abd al-Malik al-'Arzami narrated to us\u003e 'Ata' ibn Rabah\u003e Jabir ibn 'Abd al-Malik who said: 'The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a military expedition in which I was present. It was dark and so we could not determine the precise direction of the qiblah. Some of us said: we know the exact direction; it is toward the North. They prayed and drew lines. Some others said: the qiblah is toward the South. They prayed and drew lines. When it was morning and the sun had risen up, they discovered that their lines were pointed to a different direction to that of the qiblah. When we returned from our journey we asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, about this but he did not give us an answer. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse (Unto Allah belong the East and the West\ufffd)' \ufffd. Abu Mansur informed us\u003e 'Ali\u003e Yahya ibn Sa'id\u003eMuhammad ibn Isma'il al-Ahmasi\u003e Waki'\u003e Ash'ath al-Samman\u003e 'Asim ibn 'Ubayd Allah\u003e 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah\u003e his father who said: \ufffdWe were praying with the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, while on a journey. And because it was a dark night we could not determine the precise direction of the qiblah. Each man prayed toward whichever direction he thought was right. In the following morning, we mentioned what had happened to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and then the verse (Unto Allah belong the East and the West\ufffd) was revealed\ufffd. Ibn 'Umar is of the opinion that the above verse is about voluntary offering of supererogatory prayers. Abu'l-Qasim ibn Sa'dan informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Hafiz\u003e Muhammad ibn Ya'qub\u003e Abu'l-Bukhturi 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Shakir\u003e Abu Usamah\u003e 'Abd al-Malik ibn Sulayman\u003e Sa'id ibn Jubayr\u003e Ibn 'Umar who said: \ufffdThe verses (Unto Allah belong the East and the West\ufffd) was revealed so that one prays toward whatever direction one's mount directs one upon offering supererogatory prayer\ufffd."
