Abu Bakr ibn al-Harith informed us\u003e Abu\ufffdl-Shaykh al-Hafiz\u003e Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\u003e Ahmad ibn Sa\ufffdd\u003e Ibn Wahb\u003e Abu Lahi\ufffdah\u003e al-Harith ibn Zayd\u003e Thabit ibn al-Harith al-Ansari who said: \ufffdThe Jews used to say when they lost a young boy: \ufffdHe is a Tsadoq (Siddiq)\ufffd. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, heard of this and commented: \ufffdThe Jews have lied. No living person that Allah creates in the womb of his mother except that it is either felicitous or damned\ufffd. Upon which Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse (\ufffd He is Best Aware of you (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers\ufffd)\ufffd."
