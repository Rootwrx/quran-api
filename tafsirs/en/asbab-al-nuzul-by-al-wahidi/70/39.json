  "text": "(Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight? Nay\ufffd) [70:38-39]. The commentators of the Qur\ufffdan said: \ufffdThe idolaters used to gather round the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to listen to him but did not benefit from him. Instead, they gave him the lie and mocked him. They said: \ufffdIf these were to enter Paradise, we shall certainly enter it before them, and we will have more wealth therein than they will ever have\ufffd. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\ufffd."
