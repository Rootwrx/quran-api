O you who have pulled the cloak of mortal nature over your head and covered yourself with the rug of human na- ture. If you want proximity to Me, stand up through Me and drop from yourself everything other than Me. Rise up from yourself and rise up from your own rising up! Flee to the sanctuary of My exaltedness! Lift off the cloak of mortal nature from yourself, remove the rug of human nature from the road of the heart so that the heart may be a vast plain! Let it fly like a bird in the world of desire on the air of seeking until it arrives at the nest of proximity.” A great man was asked, “What is the meaning of proximity?” “If you mean the servant's proximity to the Real, expressing that is easy and alluding to it simple: It is service in seclusion, hidden from the people; the unveiling of the Haqiqah, hidden from the angels; immersion in companionship, hidden from oneself. “If you are talking about the Real's proximity to the servant, that cannot be put into words, nor do expression and allusion have any access to it. It is nothing but what He Himself says: 'Surely I am near [2:186]: Unsought, uncalled, unperceived, I am near. Compared to My closeness, the eye's blackness is distant from the eye's whiteness, for I am nearer than that, and the breath is far from the lips, for I am nearer than that. I am not near to your intellect's preserve, for I am near to My own attributes in the description of My own firstness.'” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “If people were to see the light of proximity in the recognizer, they would all be burned away, and if the recognizer were to see the light of proximity in himself, he would burn away. The knowledge of proximity does not fit into tongue and ear. It is a narrow road, and proximity disdains companionship with the tongue's water and clay. Whenever proxim- ity shows its face, how can the universe and man wait around?” As long as you are with you, what good is this talk to you? For this is the Fountain of Life, the world disowned."

Abu�l-Qasim al-Hudhami informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn �Abd Allah ibn Nu�aym Muhammad ibn �Ali al-Saghani\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Dabari\u003e �Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma�mar\u003e Ayyub al-Sikhtiyyani\u003e �Ikrimah\u003e Ibn �Abbas who related that al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who read the Qur�an to him and it seemed as if his heart softened to it. Abu Jahl heard of this. He went to him and said: �O uncle, your clan want to collect money to give it to you, for you went to Muhammad exposing yourself to his message�. He said: �The Quraysh know well that I am among its wealthiest�. Abu Jahl said: �Then say something about him which will let your people know that you condemn and dislike him�. He said: �But what shall I say? By Allah, there is not a man among you who is more knowledgeable about poetry and its composition than me. By Allah, what he says does not resemble any poetry. By Allah, the speech which he utters is sweet and graceful, fruitful at the top, copious at the bottom; it has the upper hand and nothing has the upper hand over it. But let me think about what I shall say about it. Then he said [as reported by the Qur�an] (This is naught else than magic from of old) [74:24], which he simply learnt from others�. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely�), and the other verses which follows it. Mujahid said: �Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah was in the habit of visiting the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Abu Bakr so much so that the Quraysh thought he was going to embrace Islam. Abu Jahl then said to him: �The Quraysh claim that you visit Muhammad and Ibn Abi Quhafah to share food with them�. Al-Walid said to the Quraysh: �You are people of noble lineages and sound minds, but you claim that Muhammad is mad. Have you ever seen him seized by a bout of madness?� They said: �No!� He said: �And you claim that he is a soothsayer; have you ever seen him soothsaying?� They said: �No!� He said: �You claim that he is a poet; have you ever heard him utter poetry?� They said: �No!� He said: �You claim that he is a liar; have you ever caught him lying?� They said: �No!� The Quraysh said to al-Walid: �What is he, then?� He thought for a while, looked and frowned and then said: �He is nothing but a sorcerer�, hence Allah�s saying (For lo! he did consider; then he planned�) [74:12] up to His saying (This is naught else than magic from of old)�."

It is nothing but what He Himself says: 'Surely I am near [2:186]: Unsought, uncalled, unperceived, I am near. Compared to My closeness, the eye's blackness is distant from the eye's whiteness, for I am nearer than that, and the breath is far from the lips, for I am nearer than that. I am not near to your intellect's preserve, for I am near to My own attributes in the description of My own firstness.'” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “If people were to see the light of proximity in the recognizer, they would all be burned away, and if the recognizer were to see the light of proximity in himself, he would burn away. The knowledge of proximity does not fit into tongue and ear. It is a narrow road, and proximity disdains companionship with the tongue's water and clay. Whenever proxim- ity shows its face, how can the universe and man wait around?” As long as you are with you, what good is this talk to you? For this is the Fountain of Life, the world disowned."

Abu�l-Qasim al-Hudhami informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn �Abd Allah ibn Nu�aym Muhammad ibn �Ali al-Saghani\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Dabari\u003e �Abd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma�mar\u003e Ayyub al-Sikhtiyyani\u003e �Ikrimah\u003e Ibn �Abbas who related that al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who read the Qur�an to him and it seemed as if his heart softened to it. Abu Jahl heard of this. He went to him and said: �O uncle, your clan want to collect money to give it to you, for you went to Muhammad exposing yourself to his message�. He said: �The Quraysh know well that I am among its wealthiest�. Abu Jahl said: �Then say something about him which will let your people know that you condemn and dislike him�. He said: �But what shall I say? By Allah, there is not a man among you who is more knowledgeable about poetry and its composition than me. By Allah, what he says does not resemble any poetry. By Allah, the speech which he utters is sweet and graceful, fruitful at the top, copious at the bottom; it has the upper hand and nothing has the upper hand over it. But let me think about what I shall say about it. Then he said [as reported by the Qur�an] (This is naught else than magic from of old) [74:24], which he simply learnt from others�. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely�), and the other verses which follows it. Mujahid said: �Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah was in the habit of visiting the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Abu Bakr so much so that the Quraysh thought he was going to embrace Islam. Abu Jahl then said to him: �The Quraysh claim that you visit Muhammad and Ibn Abi Quhafah to share food with them�. Al-Walid said to the Quraysh: �You are people of noble lineages and sound minds, but you claim that Muhammad is mad. Have you ever seen him seized by a bout of madness?� They said: �No!� He said: �And you claim that he is a soothsayer; have you ever seen him soothsaying?� They said: �No!� He said: �You claim that he is a poet; have you ever heard him utter poetry?� They said: �No!� He said: �You claim that he is a liar; have you ever caught him lying?� They said: �No!� The Quraysh said to al-Walid: �What is he, then?� He thought for a while, looked and frowned and then said: �He is nothing but a sorcerer�, hence Allah�s saying (For lo! he did consider; then he planned�) [74:12] up to His saying (This is naught else than magic from of old)�."
