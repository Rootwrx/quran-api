The latter went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: \ufffdTell me about the Day of Arising, when is it going to be? How is it going to be?\ufffd The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, answered his questions. Then \ufffdAdiyy said: \ufffdIf I were to see that Day with my own eyes, I would not accept what you say, O Muhammad, as true nor would I believe in you. Can Allah really assemble these bones?\ufffd And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse."
