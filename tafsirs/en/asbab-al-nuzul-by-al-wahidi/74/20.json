Abu\ufffdl-Qasim al-Hudhami informed us\u003e Muhammad ibn \ufffdAbd Allah ibn Nu\ufffdaym Muhammad ibn \ufffdAli al-Saghani\u003e Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Dabari\u003e \ufffdAbd al-Razzaq\u003e Ma\ufffdmar\u003e Ayyub al-Sikhtiyyani\u003e \ufffdIkrimah\u003e Ibn \ufffdAbbas who related that al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who read the Qur\ufffdan to him and it seemed as if his heart softened to it. Abu Jahl heard of this. He went to him and said: \ufffdO uncle, your clan want to collect money to give it to you, for you went to Muhammad exposing yourself to his message\ufffd. He said: \ufffdThe Quraysh know well that I am among its wealthiest\ufffd. Abu Jahl said: \ufffdThen say something about him which will let your people know that you condemn and dislike him\ufffd. He said: \ufffdBut what shall I say? By Allah, there is not a man among you who is more knowledgeable about poetry and its composition than me. By Allah, what he says does not resemble any poetry. By Allah, the speech which he utters is sweet and graceful, fruitful at the top, copious at the bottom; it has the upper hand and nothing has the upper hand over it. But let me think about what I shall say about it. Then he said [as reported by the Qur\ufffdan] (This is naught else than magic from of old) [74:24], which he simply learnt from others\ufffd. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely\ufffd), and the other verses which follows it. Mujahid said: \ufffdAl-Walid ibn al-Mughirah was in the habit of visiting the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and Abu Bakr so much so that the Quraysh thought he was going to embrace Islam. Abu Jahl then said to him: \ufffdThe Quraysh claim that you visit Muhammad and Ibn Abi Quhafah to share food with them\ufffd. Al-Walid said to the Quraysh: \ufffdYou are people of noble lineages and sound minds, but you claim that Muhammad is mad. Have you ever seen him seized by a bout of madness?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd He said: \ufffdAnd you claim that he is a soothsayer; have you ever seen him soothsaying?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd He said: \ufffdYou claim that he is a poet; have you ever heard him utter poetry?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd He said: \ufffdYou claim that he is a liar; have you ever caught him lying?\ufffd They said: \ufffdNo!\ufffd The Quraysh said to al-Walid: \ufffdWhat is he, then?\ufffd He thought for a while, looked and frowned and then said: \ufffdHe is nothing but a sorcerer\ufffd, hence Allah\ufffds saying (For lo! he did consider; then he planned\ufffd) [74:12] up to His saying (This is naught else than magic from of old)\ufffd."
