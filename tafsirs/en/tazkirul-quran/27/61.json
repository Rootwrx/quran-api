  "text": "Expressed as a chain of cause and effect, the theories propounded by atheists or agnostics, remain woefully inadequate to explain the creation of the unimaginably vast universe. Be it the creation of the innumerable heavenly bodies that float in boundless space, or the elaborate arrangements that make the earth habitableâ€”all these and many other such phenomena are too great and too wonderful to have been wrought by any idol or occasioned by any blind physical law. The fact is that any explanation of the universe on bases other than God  amounts to giving a false explanation of reality. This is merely a fabrication and not a genuine explanation.",
