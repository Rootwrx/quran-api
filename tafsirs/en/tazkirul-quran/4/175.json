  "text": "It is also necessary to hold on firmly to the truth. Because in this world of trial Satan is pursuing man and, by deceiving him in many ways, keeps turning him away from the Truth. If man does not resolve to support the truth by fighting Satanâ€™s deceptions, then certainly Satan will be able to induce him to enter his fold. However, in this world of trial man is not left all alone. Those who wish to tread the divine path will receive divine guidance at every turn. By the help of God they will succeed in reaching their destination. When man gives all importance to the Truth alone, by the blessing of God this ability to persevere on the straight path of pure truth is engendered within him. He is thus saved from deviating to other paths that will lead him astray.",
