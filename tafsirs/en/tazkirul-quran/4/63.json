  "text": "During the early period of Madinah there used to be two courts where judgement on controversial issues might be sought: one pre-dating Islam and controlled by the leaders of the Jews, and the other set up by the Prophet, established after the Migration. Those Muslims who were not ready to sacrifice their interests for the sake of religion and were aware that their cases were too flimsy to be awarded favourable decisions by the court of the Prophet, used to approach the court of Ka‘b ibn Ashraf, a leader of the Jews. Such an attitude is totally against the spirit of the faith. If an individual is unwilling to accept God’s judgement, and aspires to be favoured with a decision to his own liking, his claim to faith is false, whatever repertoire of beautiful words he may draw on to justify his stand. However, while avoiding confrontation with such people, efforts to reform them must be effectively continued.",
