  "text": "This verse appears here to underline the initial prohibition of intoxicants or wine, but it also reveals an important reality about prayer. Prayer does not mean the mere repetition of certain words and motions with accuracy; it must also reflect the concentration of the mind. The individual must say his prayers sincerely. When he is submitting himself to God with his utterances and his body, his mind and intention should also be in submission to Him. Along with his physical obeisance, his consciousness should inhere in his prayer. Islamic law has granted exceptional relaxations under exceptional conditions. Sickness, travelling and non-availability of waterthese are three exceptional conditions for man. It has, therefore, been permitted that, if there is any risk to health, one may perform dry ablution tayammum. The purpose of ablution is to create the spirit of purity: Tayammum is a way of maintaining that spirit when the usual ablution is not possible.",
