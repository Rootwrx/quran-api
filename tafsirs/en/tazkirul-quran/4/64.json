  "text": "A prophet is not sent to the world to raise a group of followers who will wax eloquent in his praise and cover him in glory. A prophet comes so that people should learn the code of conduct for their lives and adopt it in practice. One should be so thoroughly committed to doing so, that even in controversial situations, when conflicting interests have caused strained relations, one will not fail to obey the Prophet’s teachings. The true believer will simply suppress his ego and conscientiously follow the guidance of the Prophet. He will willingly accept his ways, even if they are detrimental to his interests and run counter to his way of thinking. He will remain mentally alert to any inadvertent mistake on his part, soon realizing that he had strayed from the Prophet’s path to the path of Satan. He will immediately repent, mend his ways and seek forgiveness. On the contrary, one who is not able to adhere to the straight path of the faith, when the dictates of faith clash with his feelings and desires, cannot be expected to remain steadfast in times of harder trial. At such trying times one has to give proof of one’s faith by making sacrifices for it.",
