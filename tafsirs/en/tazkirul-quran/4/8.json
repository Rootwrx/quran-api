  "text": "In this world a man may usurp a weak person’s right. But every unlawful acquisition that he makes is like filling up his belly with fire. The fact that whatever is usurped is like fire may not be apparent here, but it will become evident in the Hereafter. Man has been given freedom of action in this world, but he cannot manipulate the result of his actions. One who wishes to be saved from evil consequences should not do wrong to others. He should adopt the culture of beneficence and, according to his capacity, be a giver to others. If one is not in a position to benefit others in any way, one should, according to Islamic standards, at least not hurt anyone’s feelings. One should speak plainly and truthfully, or else remain silent.",
