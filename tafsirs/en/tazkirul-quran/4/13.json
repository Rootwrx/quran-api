  "text": "Payment of the dues of orphans, abiding by wills, release of the inheritance to the inheritors, etc., are among those matters on which a man’s being sent to hell or heaven depends. To make out a will disposing of one-third part of one’s property is permissible by Islamic law. But anyone making out a will with the intention of depriving a person of his rightful inheritance, would be committing a sin that could condemn him to Hell. Man has to follow the law of God in this regard and not his own personal desires or family expediencies.",
