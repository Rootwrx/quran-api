  "text": "It is a human weakness to see any outstanding aspect in anything and then hold exaggerated views about it. This is exceeding the limits in determining its actual position. This is called excess. All forms of polytheism and personality cults are the result of committing this excess. Exaggeration in religion means according an inflated status to things and personalities associated with the religion in question. The Quran enjoins us to keep everything in its proper place and to refrain from according a higher status to things and people than they actually deserve. Everything should be seen as it is, without the viewer indulging in excesses of any sort: for instance, calling a servant of God—created without a father—the son of God; or regarding someone to whom God has granted special honour and status as an extraordinary, infallible being. Similarly, if God enjoins one to abstain from the luxuries and glitter of the world, then taking this injunction on simple living to the extreme of renouncing the world is yet another form of excess. Another form of excess is taking an injunction regarding some aspect of life and exaggerating it so greatly as to develop a full-fledged religious philosophy on its basis. All such forms in which a religious injunction or precept is elevated from its real position and accorded an excessively high status will bring about an exaggeration in religion.",
