  "text": "Man-made laws have some bias or the other. During the ancient tribal age, a boy was of considerable importance in the social order. Since he was a source of strength to the tribe, he was awarded the sole right of inheritance, depriving the girl completely. This has come to be resented in modern times and consequently the boy and the girl are now both considered equal. But, if the ancient principle was unjustified, the present principle is unrealistic. A law free from all types of inequity can be expected only from God, to whom is attributed infinite knowledge and wisdom. The divine laws enjoined by God on this subject are not only a real source of social justice, but relate in the most profound way to the life Hereafter as well.",
