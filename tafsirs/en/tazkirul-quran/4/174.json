  "text": "When a divine call is made to human beings, it is so loud and clear that it amounts to wiping out darkness and illuminating lifeâ€™s realities to the ultimate extent. It comes so well fortified with arguments that it is not possible to deny it. The deniers may ridicule it, but they cannot counter it with logic. When God makes the sun rise, light and darkness are separated from one another. This divine power is expressed in the call of truth also. After this divine call, truth and untruth are so clearly separated from one another that no one in his senses finds it difficult to understand. However, in order to see the sun, man has to open his eyes. Similarly, to receive guidance from the divine call, it is necessary to pay full attention to it. One who does not pay heed will remain deprived of it, even as the divine call is being made.",
