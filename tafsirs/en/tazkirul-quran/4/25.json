  "text": "Matters of external glamour are not the scale by which to judge the honour and importance of an individual. The real standard of greatness is the unseen faith in man’s heart which is in the knowledge of God alone. Thus, whether someone is great or otherwise is beyond the comprehension of man. This unknown aspect will be judged and made known in the court of God. Realization of this fact takes away one’s superiority complex, which is usually the root cause of most social evils.",
