  "text": "Repentance does not mean simply uttering certain words like, ‘I repent’ or ‘tawbah’. It should not be mere lip service. It means the intense realization of one’s wrongdoing. If a sinner sincerely repents the error of his ways, he experiences an agonizing condition at par with self-punishment. God will surely pardon one who thus repents due to His intense fear. However, He does not accept the repentance of those who daringly and insensitively and knowingly continue to disobey and transgress, paying no heed to any warning and saying ‘I repent’ only when death is staring them in the face. Nor does the repentance of those who admit their sins only after witnessing the horrors of the Hereafter have any meaning for the Almighty. The essence of contrition is that the wrongdoer should turn to his Lord, so that the Lord also turns to him. Repentance (tawbah) is for one who commits a wrongful act under the influence of a momentary emotion or passion, but who is soon made by his conscience to realize his fault; who renounces evil ways and returns to righteousness, reforming his life according to the divine law. This shows genuine penitence. One who thus repents is like the man who, after straying away, returns to his home.",
