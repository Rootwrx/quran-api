  "text": "One of the profitable ways in which the possessions of one person are shared by another is through the system of demand and supply; another way is through payment for services rendered. Trading and the provision of services are, according to Islamic law, the right way of earning a livelihood. Any income gained by other means, such as theft, deceit, lies, bribery, usury, gambling, etc., is unlawful in the sight of God. These are nothing but different ways of plundering and those who do so at the expense of honest means of earning may be successful in this world, but all that will be in store for them in the Hereafter will be fire and brimstone. Similarly, reverence must be shown for human life. Human beings deserve justice. The right to execute a person lies in the hands of only an established government, which may punish the accused after he has been proved guilty according to the law of God. Apart from this, anyone who tries to deprive a man of his life, commits an unlawful act, for which God will prescribe severe punishment. Going beyond all limits and torturing unjustifiably are the most heinous crimes in the eyes of God. Those who desist from such unlawful acts will receive special favour from Him and will enter the eternal world of the Hereafter, after being pardoned for minor negligence and weaknesses in this world.",
