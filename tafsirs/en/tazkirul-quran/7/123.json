  "text": "To sacrifice one’s life for the sake of Truth amounts to bearing the final testimony to the Truth as the Truth. With the help of God, the magicians were enabled to make this sacrifice. The magicians, by offering themselves for the worst punishment, proved that their faith in Moses was not a matter of excuse or conspiracy, but a genuine acknowledgement of the truth. But, this supreme action of the magicians stung Pharaoh’s pride. Supporting Moses against him amounted to insulting Pharaoh before the whole community. So, Pharaoh was enraged at them. He, therefore, decided to take stern action against the magicians, as any haughty person in a position of power would do. Both the magicians as well as Pharaoh were defeated in the field of arguments. But the magicians, by admitting their defeat, became entitled to God’s eternal rewards, while Pharaoh made it a prestige issue. In order to satisfy his false egotism, he could do little but oppress truth-loving individuals and in the Hereafter be himself consigned to God’s eternal punishment. Pharaoh considered the question of acceptance or non-acceptance of Moses’ call as one involving his ‘permission’, while the magicians treated it as a ‘sign’ (from God). It is always the attitude of a haughty person that his opinion overrides arguments and proofs. Such people never receive inspiration to accept the Truth. At this critical juncture, the strength shown by the magicians was entirely due to God’s help, and the prayer which fell from their lips was entirely inspired. When a subject of God surrenders himself body and soul to God, he becomes so close to Him that he starts receiving special blessings from God. He utters such words as are God-inspired in the full sense. The magicians’ prayer, ‘Our Lord, pour patience upon us, and cause us to die in a state of submission to You,’ meant ‘We have entirely surrendered to You, O God. Now, we have done whatever it is in our power to do, and we leave the rest to You.’ When a subject of God prays like this from the bottom of his heart, certainly God is sufficient for him to solve all his difficulties.",
