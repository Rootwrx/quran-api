  "text": "The basis of the missionary call of the prophets has always been to remind man of the bounties conferred on him, and to warn him that if he did not remain grateful to God, he would have to suffer the scourge of God. Communal and material issues are never made the topics of their missionary discourses by prophets. They try their best to ensure that in the discussions between them and their addressees nothing but truths of real concern are taken up; their community should see them as preachers of the cause of the one God and the Hereafter and in no other form. ‘Remember the favours of God, so that you may prosper.’ This shows that the bounties of the Hereafter are merited only by one who has admitted God’s grace in the world. Paradise is the greatest expression of God’s grace and bountifulness. So, the Paradise of the Hereafter will be attained by one who has found and recognised God’s attribute of grace and magnanimity. This realisation is the real price of Paradise.",
