  "text": "The Book of God is one of guidance and grace. It is the best guide for man in the life of this world and a certain source of God’s grace in the Hereafter. But the Book of God can benefit only those who fear God, who constantly think of how their fate will be decided by God. These are the people who are the real seekers after Truth. So when the Truth comes before them, they accept it without suffering from any psychological complexes. God becomes the centre of their hopes and fears. Their lives and their possessions are all then devoted to God. Their fear of God awakens their consciousness. All barriers are removed from their eyes. They do not fail to recognize God’s signs when these appear before them. In short, they live in fear and not in contentment and complacency.",
