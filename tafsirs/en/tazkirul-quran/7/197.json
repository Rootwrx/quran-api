  "text": "However, this is not restricted only to known types of idols. This is the condition of all things—things which are given the status of objects of worship—from one’s native country and community to personalities, whether dead or alive, to whom those feelings are attached, whereas in reality, these feelings should be attached to the one and only God. All come into the same category (that is, it amounts to according them the status of God.) What is the reality of all these things? None has its own power; none of them has legs, hands or eyes of its own making. Every ‘leg-owner’ has been given a leg; if this limb is snatched away, he cannot make another leg again. Every ‘hand owner’ has been given a hand; if this hand does not remain with him, he cannot make another hand. Every ‘eye-owner’ has had an eye gifted to him; if this eye is lost, it is not possible for him to make another eye for himself. God alone is man’s Sustainer and Saviour. In this world He remains invisible but in the world of the Hereafter, He will reveal Himself, then man will see with his own eyes that it was God who alone was the provider and the sustainer of human beings. It was only because of his foolishness that he had attributed this to other supposed deities. These associates have no power of their own to take care even of themselves, so what can they do for others? It is God alone who helps His servants in this world and it is He who will also help His faithful servants in the world to come.",
