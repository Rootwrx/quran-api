  "text": "It happens in the world that believers and those who deny the truth alike are recipients of both the bounties and the afflictions sent down by God. But, it will not be so in the Hereafter. There, a barrier will be set up between the two. There, the joys of the bounties savoured by the people of Paradise will not reach the people of Hell, and similarly the woes afflicting the people of Hell will not reach the people of Heaven.",
