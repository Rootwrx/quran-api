  "text": "The position in Hell will be that people who were friends in this world will hate and curse each other. But, the atmosphere in Heaven will be entirely different. Here, all people’s hearts will be open to each other. Fountains of love and well-wishing for others will emerge from every heart. For the man in Hell, his past will be a bitter memory, while for the man in Heaven his past will be a pleasant memory. The future life of evil people will start with their hearts being a graveyard of regret and frustration. Their past will be solely composed of bitter memories. In contrast to this, the condition of good people will be that their minds will be full of the remembrance of God on whom they had rightly relied. They will be happy to find the intimation given by the flag-bearers of Truth to be absolutely correct. They will thankfully recognize God’s grace in His having blessed them and inspired them to support those who summoned them to accept the Truth.",
