  "text": "The greatest achievement of man is that he should be able to attain Godâ€™s mercy. But the grace of God falls to the lot of those who associate themselves with God to such an extent that all their emotions without exception are directed towards Him. They should call out only to Him and behave with humility towards Him alone. They should entertain hopes of receiving things from Him, and fear Him alone lest things be taken away. People who do so seek closeness to God and God awards them a place close to Him.",
