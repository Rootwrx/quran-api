  "text": "One of the sons of Abraham was Madyan who was born of his third wife, Quatura. The people of Midian (or Madyan), his decendants, settled on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. These people believed in God and professed to be of Abrahamâ€™s religion. But, five hundred years after the time of Abraham, they fell into wrong ways. They were a trading community; so their evil found expression in their dealings. They did not maintain the principles of honesty in weights, measures and transactions. Injustice in dealing with others is against the balanced system (islah) enforced by God. God has caused the system of this world to work on the basis of perfect justice. Here, there is nothing like taking more from others and giving less in return. Here everything functions on the principles of justice to the point of mathematical exactness. If this does not happen, then it would amount to creating a disturbance in the well-balanced world of God.",
