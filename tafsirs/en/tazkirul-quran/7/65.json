These people, settled in Yemen, were initially adherents of the religion of Noah. But later on when they strayed from the right path, God appointed Hud to be their prophet. But in the eyes of the leaders of the community, he did not appear to possess that greatness which they thought should inhere in prophets. So they felt that either he was a fool or that he was making a false claim.",
