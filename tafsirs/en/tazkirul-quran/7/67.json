  "text": "Literally ‘I am your well-wisher.’ This utterance of the prophet shows that the relationship between the call-giver and his addressees is not that of a rival or a competitor. It is a relationship of well-wishing and trust. The call-giver should be such that he should have nothing in his heart except good wishes for his addressees. Howsoever rude and unpleasant the behaviour that he comes across in his addressees may be, the call-giver should remain their well-wisher till the last moment. Then, while delivering his message, he should not have the feeling that he is bestowing upon another something which belongs to him. He should feel rather that it belongs to others and that he is holding it in trust for them, and that, by delivering it, he is relieving himself of a great responsibility.",
