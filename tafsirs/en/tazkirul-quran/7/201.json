  "text": "Calling people to monotheism, the Hereafter, a virtuous life and justice is to call people to good (‘urf). That is, it is calling people to those good deeds, the goodness of which can be verified by reason. But people have found leading an upright life most difficult. The desire for immediate gain makes them opt for worldly gain. Very often they exploit religion to achieve their worldly interests. In such a state of affairs when the call for pure Truth is given to them, they are afraid that their interests will be affected so they oppose it with all their might. What should a preacher (da‘i) do in such a situation? The only right response from him on such occasions, is avoidance. That is, he should continue spreading the message without stirring up any clash or confrontation. If he fails to do so, ‘dawah’ will be turned into debate. His time and energies will be wasted in debating with his addressees. That is why, in order to preserve the purity of the call, it is essential that the da‘i exercise patience in all unpleasant situations and continue his work along positive lines. However, in this present world, no one is exempt from the attacks of self and Satan. What saves him on all such occasions is the fear of God. Fear of God makes one extremely sensitive. It is this sensitivity which is man’s greatest shield in this world of trial. Whenever any evil thought comes to his mind, or he is afflicted by a negative psychology, it is his sensitivity which immediately alerts him against it. Instantly his eyes are opened and he seeks God’s forgiveness and resolves never to commit such perverse acts again. On the contrary, those whose hearts are free from the fear of God are never on guard against Satan’s attacks. Satan leads them on and on to the pit of destruction without their ever being conscious of it. Sensitivity is man’s greatest shield. While insensitivity renders one defenceless against Satan’s attacks.",
