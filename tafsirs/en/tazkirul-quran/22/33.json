  "text": "The rites of worship or prayer in Islam have two aspects—the outward and the inward. The inward aspect is the real essence of worship. The outward aspect serves as a symbol (sha‘irah, pl. sha‘a’ir) of this inward aspect. The rites specified by God cannot be treated as being carried out properly if they are simply observed outwardly. In order to be properly observed, these deserve to be performed with a pure and God-fearing heart. Animals specified for sacrifice are among God’s symbols. They are the symbols of realities and not the realities themselves. In order to please God, it is not enough to colour these animals, or to abstain from riding them or utilizing them in any manner. God’s pleasure lies in whatever is done being done purely for His sake. What God appreciates is the innermost feelings of the heart and not merely external trappings.",
