  "text": "In this world, if an individual or a community rebels against God, God catches hold of that individual or community. But God does not make haste to do so. Man may lose patience in a day, but God does not become impatient even for a thousand years. God may observe disobedience among people, yet gives them ample opportunity to reform themselves, if they are so inclined. God catches hold of wrongdoers only when they have finally proved that they are guilty and incorrigible. God treated people in this manner in the past and people of the future will also be treated according to His immutable method.",
