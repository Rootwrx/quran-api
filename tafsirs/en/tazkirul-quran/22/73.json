  "text": "To clothe anybody except God with holiness is absolute stupidity, because holiness is given to a being who has inherent power, and as far as this world is concerned, there is no human being or non-human being who enjoys real power. A fly is an ordinary creature, but all the things of the earth and heavens together cannot bring into existence even this ordinary fly. Then where is the justification for holding anything other than God to be holy? All these beliefs are, in fact, based on an underestimation of Godâ€™s godhead. People do believe in God, but they are not fully aware of His majesty and power. If they believe in God as He should be believed in, then all deviant beliefs will strike them as meaningless to the point of being ridiculous. Then they themselves will give up all such beliefs.",
