  "text": "The central force in this universe is only one, and it is the Being of the one God. One who attaches himself to God has, as it were, found his real abode. He stands on firm ground. Unlike him is one who does not attach himself to God or who only outwardly accepts God, but in his heart of hearts is attached to someone else. Such a person is in effect cut off from that centre, apart from which there is no other centre in the universe. The condition of this individual will be like that described in this verse.",
