  "text": "The scheme by which God created man and settled him on earth, necessitated His providing guidance to man and showing him which way leads to paradise and which way to hell. He, therefore, ordained the selection of certain human beings for prophethood and then sent them His messages by the angels. By this arrangement, on the one hand, man is being made aware of the reality. On the other, Almighty God is keeping a watch on peopleâ€™s actions. Thereafter, when the period of testing is over, all the people will be brought back before God in order that they may be requited according to their performance.",
