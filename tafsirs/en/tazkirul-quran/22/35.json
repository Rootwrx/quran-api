  "text": "Whatever products a man avails of in this world—be they agricultural products, animal products or industrial products—they develop in him one of two different types of mentality. With one he either thinks that all the material things he possesses are the result of his talents and hard work, or he attributes their availability to the blessings of certain pagan gods. This mentality is entirely polytheistic. With the other way of thinking, whatever a man receives is considered the gift of God. Charity and sacrifice are the prescribed methods of the external expression of these feelings. The individual offers a part of his earnings for the sake of God, and in this way, he admits that whatever he possesses is the gift of God and not the result of his talents.  If a man acquires knowledge of God (ma‘rifah) in the true sense, the condition of his heart will be the same as is described as ‘the humble’ (al-mukhbitin)  verse 34. Such a man will, with his body and soul, turn towards God. He will be overwhelmed with feelings of humility and modesty. He will tremble at the thought of God. He will start considering everything he has as belonging to God and not to himself.",
