  "text": "A man who is sincere in his faith, tolerates the sacrifice of anything belonging to him. The one thing he is not prepared to sacrifice is his faith. In pursuing this course, if he is required to leave his home, he leaves it, and if he has to give something, he gives it. He is tied to faith forever until he dies. Those who prove in the life of this world that they consider their faith to be the most valuable thing, will be highly appreciated by God and they will be given the most valuable thing in the life hereafter. There they will spend an eternal life of comfort and happiness.",
