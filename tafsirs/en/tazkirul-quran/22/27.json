  "text": "The initial purpose in the constructing of the Kabah was to provide a centre of worship for those who were at ‘walking’ distance from that place. But, ultimately, it was to become a centre of worship of the one God for the whole world. And this purpose was fully achieved. The rites and customs which a pilgrim is required to perform after reaching here have been briefly described in the Quran, while full details are given in the traditions (Hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad. ‘They may witness its benefits for them’ means that they may actually see here the benefits of belief in a practical sense which they had so far been aware of solely as matters of faith. Great historical importance is attached to the places a pilgrim visits during Hajj. Quite naturally, visiting these places and seeing them melts one’s heart. Muslims of the whole world gather there, making the great international stature of Islam a visible reality. The annual gathering of Hajj promotes collectivism on a universal scale in Islam, and even the journey entailed affords the pilgrim many worldly and religious experiences which are helpful in the formation of his future life.",
