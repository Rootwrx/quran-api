  "text": "One instance of the denial of Truth is illustrated by an incident which occurred in ancient Makkah. The people of Makkah, intolerant of even the most peaceful activities of the Prophet Muhammad, imposed many restrictions on him. He and his companions became the target for atrocities, and were even prevented from entering the Kaâ€˜bah. Such behaviour on the part of the Makkans, on top of their denial of the Truth, amounted to adding insult to injury. Those who indulge in this kind of sinful behaviour deserve the severest punishment from God.",
