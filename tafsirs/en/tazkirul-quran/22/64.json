  "text": "When a man builds up his life on the basis of Truth, he comes across different types of difficulties, such as being harassed by others at Satan’s instigation. This reduces the worshipper of Truth to a state of abject despair. But, the universe, in its silent language, declares that there is no question of despair for any of God’s subjects. They have only to compare their condition to that of the earth when, due to extreme heat, it loses all its greenery and becomes dry and barren. To all appearances there is no hope of life. Then, as He does every year, God performs His wonderful miracle—He brings the rain—and all is green again. This is an example of God’s power which is made manifest every year at the material level. Can anyone then doubt His efficacy at the human level?",
