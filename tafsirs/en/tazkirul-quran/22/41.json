  "text": "The special condition for a man to be entitled to Godâ€™s help is that he should not become corrupt, even if he comes to possess power. The elevation of his status should result in an increase in his modesty and humility. Those who are righteous in this manner before acquiring power are the ones who can prove to be righteous in the conditions prevailing after their acquiring power. Such are those who, when given power, show humility before God, and fulfil and discharge the rights of their fellow human beings. In the affairs of life, they do whatever pleases God and refrain from doing whatever displeases Him.",
