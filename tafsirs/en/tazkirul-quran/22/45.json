  "text": "Before God, people with eyes are those who look at things in order to learn a lesson or draw wisdom from them. Those who see things without learning a lesson from them, are blind in the eyes of God. Their seeing is like that of animals, not human beings. God has spread on the earth innumerable lesson-giving things. Among them are the ancient memorials left behind by past nations. These nations once enjoyed pomp and power, but the signs of their existence today are nothing but a few dilapidated ruins. This reminds everybody of the fate he is finally going to meet. But when people lose the mindâ€™s eye, the eyes on the face will fail to show them anything meaningful.",
