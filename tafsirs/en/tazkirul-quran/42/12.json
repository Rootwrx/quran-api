  "text": "The phenomena of the heavens and the earth before us are so gigantic that it is absolutely unimaginable that they were brought into existence by any of those false gods whom the people revere and respect instead of God Almighty. Similarly, the procreative and survival mechanism installed in the inner system of human beings and animals is so intricate and complex that it cannot really be attributed to any human being or to any of the gods other than the one and All Powerful God. All these arrangements are so extraordinary that they can be legitimately and properly attributed only to that Unparalleled Being, God. The attributes of the Creator which come to our knowledge through observation of His creations are sufficient to prove how great the Creator is. He is All Knowing and All Observing. Most High and Almighty, He possesses all powers. Whatever one receives, is due to His Grace and whatever is taken away, is taken away by Him. He is Unique. There is nobody like Him.",
