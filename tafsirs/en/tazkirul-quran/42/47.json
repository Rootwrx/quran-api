  "text": "The real test of man in the present world is his ability, irrespective of the circumstances, to give a proper and correct reaction. But man does not do so. When he meets with success, he turns into a vain braggart and when he gets into trouble, he can do nothing but express negative feelings. Such people, who are unable to respond properly to the call for Truth, are by temperament unrealistic. The correct response to the call for Truth is that man should immediately admit to its being such. But he makes it a prestige issue. He thinks that by accepting the call, he will be lowering himself before the person who gives the call. This feeling comes in the way of his acceptance of the Truth. In spite of being convinced of its veracity, he ignores the call on account of personal considerations.",
