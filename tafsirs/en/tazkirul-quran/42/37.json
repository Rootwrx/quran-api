  "text": "Only that person who reposes faith in God can be desirous of the Hereafter. In reality, whenever a man moves in the direction of the Hereafter, it appears to him that he is in danger of losing worldly benefits. Worldly considerations seem to be slipping from his grasp. This being so, the only thing which keeps a man steady on the path of the Hereafter is his unwavering reliance on the assurances of God. He should firmly believe that whatever he is losing in this world for the sake of God, will be multiplied many times over by God in the Hereafter. The bounty of this world is of a temporary nature, while the good things of the Hereafter are eternal and never ending. A short-lived benefit in comparison with eternal bounty carries no weight whatsoever.",
