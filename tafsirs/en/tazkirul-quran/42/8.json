  "text": "God Almighty has provided man with extraordinary access to His Grace, such as has not been provided for any other living creature: that is the grant of discretionary power to man to adopt His guidance voluntarily, and as a consequence thereof to become entitled to exceptional rewards from Him. The choice to opt for good or bad ways is the price of this freedom. This difference is certainly undesirable, but there is no other method to pick out the person of real worth. God has created man free, but He has made provision for the guidance of man in his inner self as well as externally through the guidance of prophets and the Book of God, so much so that if man is really serious he will never take the wrong path. This being so, those who take the wrong path, are the worst transgressors. They will in no way be held deserving of pardon by God.  In this world, there can be no final verdict in respect of the differences arising between the proponents of Truth and followers of falsehood. The position in this world is that here one can produce words in support of the latter. Here it is possible even for falsehood to be shown in the shape of Truth. But, all this is restricted solely to the arena of the present life, it is one man against another. In the life Hereafter, it will be man versus God. There, it will not be possible for anybody to hide behind beautiful words.",
