  "text": "In this world, guidance is revealed through logic, this being the law of God for this world. This means that in this world only that person will benefit from guidance who proves himself capable of understanding matters by a process of reasoning. The establishing of a fact by this method is enough to make him bow down before it. Those who do not accept facts in this way, can never receive guidance in this world. One who does not yield to reason in this world, runs the risk of being laid low by Godâ€™s power in the Hereafter. But bowing down on the Day of Judgement is of no avail to anybody, because then it will serve only to humble a man and not make him entitled to a reward.",
