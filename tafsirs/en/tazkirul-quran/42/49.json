  "text": "Religion is based on the concept that every kind of power in the universe resides in the one and only God. Apart from Him, nobody else has any powersâ€”whether these powers relate to managing the systems of heaven and earth or granting children to a human being. Whatever a man receives is at His behest and He alone may take it away whenever He wishes. It is only this belief about God which develops in man that right type of feeling which is known as submissiveness, and it is this attitude towards God which compels a man to adopt in life that behaviour which is commanded by the divine code of conduct.",
