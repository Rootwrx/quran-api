  "text": "Every test in this world is a test of intention. What man has to do is to prove his intention by ignoring dangers; in that way he takes the first step on the path towards God. Then God’s help comes to him immediately thereafter. But one who does not provide proof of his intention and does not take the first step in the direction of God, is a transgressor in His eyes. Such individuals cannot then expect to be sent God’s unilateral help. Islamic life is a purposeful life and therefore it is a life of struggle. It is the mission of a believer to convey the religion of God to all God’s subjects, guiding the world to keep away from the path leading to hell and to tread the path leading to paradise.",
