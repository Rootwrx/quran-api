  "text": "The greatest achievement for a man is his nearness to God. This nearness in its real and perfect shape will be his in the Hereafter. However, when a man’s righteous action brings him nearness to God, he experiences this in this world purely in the form of heavenly feeling. The way to attain this nearness is through taqwa (fear of God) and jihad (struggle) i.e. becoming a worshipper or devotee of God through fear of God and struggling to make efforts for His cause. There are some moments in the life of a man when he finds himself in between Truth and untruth. In taking the direction of Truth, he has to surrender his ego and the structure of his worldly considerations seems to become insecure, while in adopting the way of untruth, his ego remains intact and his worldly considerations seem to be perfectly safe. In the former case, a man fears God and, overlooking all other considerations sticks to God; tolerating every difficulty and unpleasantness, he moves ahead towards God—these are the things which bless him with nearness to God. First hand experience of this nearness at that time takes the shape of aesthetic heavenly realization. On the contrary, the person who is not ready to adopt the path of fearing God and struggling to make efforts for the cause of God, drifts away from Him, and brings upon himself afflictions from which he can never get relief. The punitive system in Islam for social crimes has been formulated keeping in view two special aspects—one is punishment for a man’s crime and the other is the deterrent effect of that punishment. However, if a criminal is truly repentant after committing a crime, seeks God’s pardon and completely refrains from such misdemeanours in future, then it may be hoped that God will forgive him in the Hereafter. The matter of reward is entirely in the hands of God. There is no cause to fear, however, that despite an individual having reformed only later in his life, his earlier transgressions will not be pardoned. Nor is it true that there is some force, other than God’s will which, by recommendation or intervention, can change one’s destiny. Everything rests with God and He alone in His perfect wisdom and power decides the fate of everyone.",
