  "text": "On Judgement Day this fact will finally be clear that nobody in this universe has any power except the One and Only God. At that time, when the worshippers of false gods see the gods whom they worshipped, they will make excuses to try to prove their innocence. In other words, they will represent these false gods as having deceived them and made them worship non-gods. But the false gods will immediately contradict this and will say, ‘This was your own arrogance. In order to avoid obedience to God, you yourself devised false gods and in their names you “proved” your self-loving religion to be legitimate.’ There are some who do not accept the call of Truth, and there are others who, further to this, try by various methods to prevent others from doing so. The first type of behaviour results from being misguided, while the second type is that of deliberate misguidance. The punishment given to misguided people will be doubled in the case of those who knowingly misguided others.",
