  "text": "In the Quran Abraham (Ibrahim) has been presented as a paragon of virtue. Why did he become such an exemplary person? Because in the face of the generally vitiated atmosphere, he was the only man who was steadfast in his Faith. All alone he stood for God, with nobody there to support him. Abraham had completely surrendered to the will of God. In the world-wide polytheistic atmosphere, he had devoted himself to the Faith of monotheism. He considered all things to have been received from God, and for that his heart was full of gratitude to God. Due to his perfect Faith, God opened all the paths of guidance for him and selected him for prophethood, so that he might acquaint the people of the world with the religion of God. Abraham was given the good things of this world (wa ataynahu fi’d dunya hasanah) as well as the good things of the Hereafter. It is known that in this world Abraham had neither crowds surrounding him nor the throne of power nor any of the other trappings of worldly glory. Nevertheless, the Quran testifies that he was given good things of the world at God’s behest. This shows that in the eyes of God the betterment of the world hinges neither on public popularity nor on wealth or power, but on what are described here as the characteristics of Abraham.",
