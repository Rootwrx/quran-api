  "text": "At some points God sent his prophets directly to mankind and at other points He arranged to convey His message indirectly through the deputies of prophets and their representatives. All of them advised man that God alone is entitled to be worshipped and prayed to. Satan tries to dissuade or divert man from such worship and prayer. Therefore, man should save himself from satanic inducements; otherwise he will be pushed into worshipping false gods. Though divine guidance is clear, its acceptance or rejection depends upon the extent of manâ€™s seriousness about it. One who gives serious consideration to guidance will not take long to find the truth. But one who is not serious about it will remain enmeshed in trivial issues. Such a person can never find the Truth.",
