  "text": "The main reason for manâ€™s going astray is his underestimation of God, Lord of the Universe. Many wrong beliefs have come into existence because God was judged to be a lesser entity than He really is. It is the result of such underestimation of God that people, though believing in God, remain fearless of Him. They form the belief about very ordinary things that these will be a source of proximity to God and that all the bounties of the Hereafter will be allotted to them as their share. The belief is entertained that a thing which does not make even an ordinary man happy, will please God. This amounts to adding arrogance to wrongdoing, which can never be pardoned by God.",
