  "text": "There are two objectives in reading the Quran—one is for the guidance of the self and the other is to present it to others to encourage them to understand the Truth. Whether the actual words of the Quran are repeated or its meanings are explained, man should in any case seek the protection of God against Satan. It does not mean simply repeating some fixed words; it means consciously arming oneself so that Satan’s attack becomes ineffective. Satan is always lying in wait for man. He changes the meaning of the words of the Quran in the mind of the reader, and what cannot be included in the text he inserts in the commentary. In this way Satan raises controversial issues between the preacher and the addressee, as a result of which understanding the true meaning of the Quran becomes difficult. However, God has given liberty to Satan only to misguide and instigate. He has not given power to him to lead anyone astray by force (laysa lahu sultan). His actions have no effect on those who have maintained their mental connection with God. But those who are neglectful of God and pay attention to the word of Satan become subject to Satan, who leads them towards his evil path.",
