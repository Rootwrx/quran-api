  "text": "Whenever untruth dominates the current atmosphere, one who accepts the Truth faces severely trying circumstances: his surroundings force him to revert to the customary religion. Under these circumstances, if he remains steady in his adherence to the Truth and leaves everything (even his property and his native place), then he is a migrator (muhajir). One who strives and struggles (mujahid) for the cause of God, makes himself deserving of a huge reward. What keeps a man steady on the path of Truth under the trying circumstances of the world is his remembrance of the Hereafter. Every man is soon going to face a Day so terrible that he will forget even his friends and relatives. At that time no one will be able to say anything on behalf of anybody, and no one will come forward in commendation of anybody. If a man fully realizes the meaning of that coming Day, he will be in a condition to bear any type of loss, but he will not abandon the Truth.",
