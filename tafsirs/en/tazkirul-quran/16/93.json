  "text": "There are unfathomable aspects of this world. Truth and untruth are not separate and distinct. The reason for this is to be found in the plan of God by which He created this world, a plan designed to ascertain the true moral fibre of each and every individual on this earth. Indeed, man has been brought into this present world for the purpose of being tested. This purpose would not have been served had man not been given the freedom to accept or reject Godâ€™s word. He had to have the freedom to show truth to be untruth and to present untruth in the shape of truth. If God had not had this in view, he would have subjected all human beings to His orders, just as He did with the rest of the universe. This state of affairs will be perpetuated till the Day of Judgement. On the Day of Judgement it will be clear as to who used his judgement correctly, and who ignored the Truth for the sake of self-interest. At that time God will mete out to each individual such treatment as will be commensurate with his or her performance during the period of trial in the present world.",
