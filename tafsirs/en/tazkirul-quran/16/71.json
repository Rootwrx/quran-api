  "text": "With the help of a simple analogy here, the belief that God has some partners and that these so-called partners have been given some powers has been shown to be wrong. In this world the division of material assets is not uniform. It is generally seen that one person has a great deal while another has so little that he is compelled to be the servant or slave of one who has plenty. Now an affluent person does not distribute his wealth among his servants in order to remove the difference between him and them. So, by analogy, it is not correct to believe that God has distributed His powers among others. Nobody denies his own greatness. Then how can God want to do something which even a man would not like to do? The fact is that a man has no possessions of his own, while the possessions of God are His own and not gifted by others. The fact is that all such beliefs are inconsistent with the image of God!",
