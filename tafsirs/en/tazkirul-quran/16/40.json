  "text": "The present world is so constituted that Truth and untruth are not always clearly distinguishable from each other due to the trial of man. As such there is always scope for denial of the truth. Ways of contradicting valid arguments can always be found and some device or the other can be resorted to to cast doubt on established facts. This is entirely against the scheme of the universe. In physical sciences it is possible to reach some definite results. Similarly, in respect of human beings, the truth should be brought out into the open. This proves the need for the Judgement Day to take place. Shah Abdul Qadir Dehlavi writes, ‘In this world many things remained doubtful; some accepted God and some denied Him, so there must be another world where disputes are resolved; truth and falsehood are distinguished; and the accepter and the rejecter are rewarded according to their deeds.’",
