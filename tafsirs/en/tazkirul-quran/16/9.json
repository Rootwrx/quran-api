  "text": "Generally, of the various highways the traveller has to choose from, there is a recognized route by which he can go straight to his destination. But, running parallel with, or connecting to each highway, there are always many lanes and by-ways. If the traveller chooses to drive along one of the latter, thinking he is on the right road, he will never reach his destination, but will stray many miles to the right or left of it. The same is true of reaching God. God has already shown man which way will lead to Him. This is the way of the Unity of God (tawhid) and the fear of God (taqwa). One who follows this path will reach God and one who goes another way will be lost by the wayside; he will never be able to reach his Lord. Everything in the world treads the path fixed by God. Had God so wished, man also would have been compelled to follow the path fixed by God. But the scheme of the creation of man is different from that of the creation of other things. Other things are required only to follow a regulatory discipline. But in the case of man, what is required is voluntary obedience to this discipline. The result of there being this opportunity to voluntarily submit to regulation is that while one person will take the right path, another will leave it and become lost on paths of his own devising.",
