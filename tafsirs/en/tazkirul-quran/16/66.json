  "text": "A characteristic peculiar to milch animals is that whatever they eat is converted into dung and blood yet there emerges along with these a liquid, milk, which is the most valuable food for man. This is also true of the trees. Mud, water and other such things enter them and under the influence of their internal system, they take the shape of juicy fruits which hang from the branches. These occurrences are meant to remind people of God. Through them man should start seeing glimpses of His Majesty. This realization should be so intense that he should spontaneously exclaim, ‘Oh God! You cause milk to come out from non-milk. God, let favourable results emerge from the unfavourable situations I am faced with. God, you transform mud and water into fruits, please turn my valueless life into a valuable one.’",
