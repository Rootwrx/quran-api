  "text": "When those who are of a haughty mentality hear any discourse about God, their minds start working in perverse ways and they are, therefore, unable to learn a lesson from it. But one who fears God in his heart, will hear the discourse about God with full receptivity. For such a person, it becomes a source of spiritual realization; in it he sees glimpses of a higher reality. One of the main features of paradise is that everything is available there that a man desires. There are things there which are not available in this world to anybody —not even to the greatest kings. In the present world, due to man’s limitation and due to the unfavourable nature of external conditions, it never happens that man obtains whatever he wants. The concept that in paradise, man will find whatever he desires is of such allure that whatever sacrifice has to be made to enter paradise is negligible by comparison.",
