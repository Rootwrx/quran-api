  "text": "The coming of prophets and prophets’ followers as preachers of the Truth to communities and nations would seem to be an ordinary event. The world has treated these events as being so insignificant that, excepting the last of the prophets (the Prophet Muhammad), there is no prophet whose work has been treated as worthy of mention in contemporary histories. But their task assumes great importance and seriousness when it is seen linked with the Hereafter. In the majestic court of the Hereafter, these very prophets and bearers of the Truth will be testifiers on behalf of God and, on the strength of their testimony, the eternal future of people will be decided. Those who, according to the testifiers, accepted the Truth and surrendered themselves in submission to it will be treated as people of paradise in the eternal world there; and those who, according to these Godly testifiers, rejected the Truth and were not willing to submit to it, will be consigned to eternal hell. If in a community or nation, true envoys of God make their appearance and that community does not accept their word, then it is a definite proof of that community’s being blameworthy. Thereafter that community loses the right to plead that they were not aware of Judgement Day, Paradise and Hell and that, as such, they should be saved from the punishment of Judgement Day.",
