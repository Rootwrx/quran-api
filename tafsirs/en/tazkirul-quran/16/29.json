  "text": "Arrogance is the worst crime. God will pardon every wrongdoing of man, but He will not pardon arrogance. Haughtiness expresses itself in two ways. One is that which commonly prevails among God’s subjects. An individual, for example, finds himself better endowed with power, wealth, property and other goods as compared to others and so he starts behaving haughtily towards them. The other more serious type of haughtiness is that which is directed against God’s envoy, who works towards the general call of truth. The true servant of God responds to the call of God’s religion. But those who have attained a high status on the basis of false religion feel that they are adversely affected by this call and that by the standards of true religion, their worth is severely diminished. So they flare up over this and ignore the preacher of Truth in their arrogance. A man behaves haughtily with someone, because he thinks that the other person cannot harm him. But when the angels of death approach and reduce him to helplessness, he will then realise that he had not been dealing with a man but with God. One man can be stronger than another, but who can be stronger than God? When God’s angels take things under their control, then every man will surrender. But a true subject of God is one who surrenders to God before this.",
