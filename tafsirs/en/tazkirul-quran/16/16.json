  "text": "Here, two things are mentioned: maintenance of balance on the earth by raising mountains and the provision of signs to guide people on their way. Geographical studies show that when the oceans were formed, the earth started shaking. Thereafter, high mountains emerged on the surface of the land, and in this way as a result of the two-phased action, balance was restored on the earth. Had there been no such balance on the surface of the earth, human life here would have been impossible, or at least extremely difficult. Similarly, on his travels, the human being needs signs with the help of which he can make out the correct direction and reach his destination without going astray; here too the perfect arrangement is in existence. The human being of ancient times used to find his way with the help of such things as rivers and the stars. Nowadays, he finds his way with the help of magnetic instruments. Speedy flights on land and water as well as in space are possible with their help. Had signs of such a type not been in existence, human activities would have remained confined to a very limited sphere.",
