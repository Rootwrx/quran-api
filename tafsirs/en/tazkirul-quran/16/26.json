  "text": "When those who have attained a high status on a false basis, see the call for Truth gaining ground, they feel that their position is at risk. For the protection of their position, they adopt the strategy of spreading mischievous statements against the divine call in order to make people doubtful about it and desist from rallying to it. But the devices of such people against the call for Truth are never successful. The basic structures on which the opponents of Truth rely prove to be so weak that their roof literally caves in on them. Sometimes it happens that an earthquake shakes their foundations and causes their buildings to fall down on them. Sometimes their companions leave them and join the ranks of the truth-followers, so that in losing their supporters, they are compelled to surrender to the call of Truth. This end, in its final and perfect form, will appear on Doomsday when those who denied the truth will see their eternal degradation and will be helpless in the face of it.",
