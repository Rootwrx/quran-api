  "text": "In the foregoing verse, No.\n75\n, it was shown that the concept of partners in relation to God was baseless. Now in this verse No.\n76\n, it is clarified that also in relation to the Prophet, those beings on the strength of whom a man ignores the guidance of the Prophet, are also without any basis in reality. God, by giving His special attention to a prophet, guides him towards a path which is the highway of Truth and which directly leads towards Himself. The Prophet and his companions not only tread this highway themselves but also guide others towards it. Unlike them, there are others who beckon people towards ways other than the ways of the Prophet. They are like blind and deaf people. They do not have ears to hear the voice of God. They do not have eyes to catch glimpses of Godâ€™s glories. They do not have the heart and mind to discover the signs of God spread throughout the universe. Man was granted the ability to hear, observe and realize by means of the heart and mind, so that he should see the Glory of God, the Creator, through the medium of created things. But man has utilized these capacities in such a way that he has become obsessed with the creatures themselves.",
