  "text": "One who studies the universe, whether he be a common man or a scientist, always experiences a few moments when, while pondering over God’s creations, his mind is diverted towards the Creator. He starts feeling that these wonderful things have neither come into existence of their own accord, nor have they been made by so-called gods; their Creator is none other than Almighty God. But acceptance of God necessarily demands a change in man’s own life. It takes away a man’s freedom. So, when he undergoes this experience, after being temporarily affected, he directs his mind elsewhere. After finding God, he leaves Him.",
