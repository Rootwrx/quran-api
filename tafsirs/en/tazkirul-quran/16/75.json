  "text": "Here, a simple and common example has been given to clarify the incorrectness of polytheistic analogies. Take the individual who has considerable property and compare him with another who has no possessions whatsoever. These two individuals are perforce very different in their outlook and style of living. So any analogy drawn about the one would not apply to the other. In the case of God and His subject, this difference is of infinite magnitude. This being so, how can it be possible for an analogy to be drawn for God on the basis of the human condition? In this universe, the relation between God and all other things is that of a Creator and His creatures, and not that of God and His partners. The Being of God is that Entity who is endowed with all kinds of miraculous attributes; He is the sole provider of all kinds of bounties. In this universe there is no joint performer with God. To make such an assumption is unrealistic and runs counter to the facts.",
