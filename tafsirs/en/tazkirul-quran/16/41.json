  "text": "Most of the commentators of the Quran have held that this verse relates to the eighty companions of the Prophet who had become victims of persecution by opponents of Islam and finally migrated to Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia) leaving their native place. This event occurred in the Makkan period before the Hijrah (migration) to Madinah. With regard to the Truth, there are always two groups—one group consists of those who undervalue Truth to such an extent that they are unwilling to sacrifice anything for its sake or re-plan their lives. The other group consists of those who adhere to the Truth in such a way that it becomes the most important thing for them, and they are willing to suffer all sorts of trouble for its sake; they make Truth their most important issue; they can sacrifice all else, but they cannot sacrifice the Truth. Naturally, these two kinds of group cannot share the same fate. Those who gave Truth the most important place in their lives, will be treated as entitled to God’s eternal bounties, but those who ignored the Truth will be ignored by God likewise; they will not be able to secure any place of honour in the eyes of God; neither can they have any share in God’s bounties.",
