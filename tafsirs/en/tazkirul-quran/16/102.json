  "text": "The Quran is the Book of dawah. Its various parts were revealed bit by bit over a period of twenty three years. In consideration of the training of the believers, a gradual approach was adopted in respect of certain commandments. Taking advantage of such ‘changes’, the opponents of Islam used to say that the Quran was not the Book of God, but the Prophet Muhammad’s own writings which he attributed to God. They used to say that, if it had come directly from God, there would not have been such changes in it. Had these opponents been sincere and serious in the study of the Quran and had they looked upon the factor of change in the right perspective, they would have seen the wisdom of a gradual approach in giving orders. But when they saw the matter in the wrong perspective, changes appeared to them to be the result of a lack of human knowledge. A reasoned confirmation of these changes not being immediately forthcoming gave rise to the levelling of false allegations. The Quran has been revealed to present the Truth—here Truth means the pure and unadulterated religion of God. Those who are seekers after Truth and who are not satisfied with adulterated religions, will find not only the answer to their search in the Quranic religion but also peace of mind therein.",
