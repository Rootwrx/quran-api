  "text": "Supporting a messenger of God amounts to renouncing the customary religious system and becoming attached to a non-customary religion. This type of action is always most difficult for man. This involves ignoring the benefit to be received from human beings and proceeding towards the benefit which will be given by God. The only virtue which is required if this type of decision is to be taken is ‘patience’; that is, a man should be able to bear today’s loss for the sake of tomorrow’s benefit; he should have the ability to give more importance to a thing which is unseen in comparison to that which is seen; he should have the urge to adopt something at the cost of sacrifice, even if it means forfeiting some immediate benefit. The subjects of God who prove to have such high ideals deserve to be blessed by God with the highest type of bounties. Those who support unadulterated pure Truth suffer a loss in the current system, so people think that such individuals are ruined. But there is a promise from God that He will fully compensate them for their sacrifices. In the eternal world after death, He will bless them with an extremely good life. Whatever they have lost temporarily will be restored by God in a better form and forever. This promise of God applies equally to women. Before God in the matter of rewards, there is no distinction between men and women.",
