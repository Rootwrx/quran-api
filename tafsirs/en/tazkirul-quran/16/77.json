  "text": "Immanent in the outward visible world, there is an unseen system. This unseen system was established by God. Due to our limitations, we do not see this unseen system; but everything about us is open and obvious to this unseen system. Remaining unseen, God is keeping a watchful eye on every big and small thing of His world. He has the most accurate assessment of everything. When God decides that the period of manâ€™s trial is over, at that very moment He will just make a sign, and then, in the twinkling of an eye, the whole existing system will break down, and a new, differently based system will come into existence, so that everyone may be placed in the position in which he belongs in actual fact and not in the position  he had occupied by underhand means.",
