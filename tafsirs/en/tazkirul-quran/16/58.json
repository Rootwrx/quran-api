  "text": "Why does a man want children? It is for the purpose of compensating for his shortcomings. But God is above such things. The Majesty and Power of God, which is evident in the existence of the universe, shows that God is far above any shortcomings to compensate which He would feel the necessity of creating a son or a daughter. The fact is that if God were deficient in any way, He would not have been God at all. God is God because He is entirely flawless.",
