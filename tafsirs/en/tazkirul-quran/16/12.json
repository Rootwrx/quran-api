  "text": "The sun, the moon and the stars all revolve continuously in the vastness of space with total precision. On the earth, there are innumerable examples of God’s creation (animals, vegetation, rocks and minerals, etc.). The former phenomenon highlights the totally submissive aspect of creation, (musakhkharatun bi amrihi), while the latter phenomenon highlights the endless variety of creation (mukhtalifan alwanuhu). The first scene reminds man of the limitlessness of God’s power, while the second scene reminds him of the multiplicity of God’s attributes. These scenes are so wonderful that the keen-eyed observer cannot remain unaffected by them. In these things, he will see God’s majesty and His role as Sustainer; he will discover unseen realities hidden in external occurrences; by looking at God’s creations, he will be immersed in the realization of the Creator.",
