  "text": "The system of rains and vegetation has a great lesson in it. Due to the concerted action of various factors, water vapours rise in the air and form clouds and again fall on the earth in the form of rain. Then this rain causes the growth of lush green cover on the earth. In this happening, there is firstly a lesson that, in this universe everywhere, the activism or workmanship of the one God is manifest. Had many gods been active here, there could not have been such wonderful coordination in the various forces of the universe that could result in such a unified harmonious process. The unity in the system of the universe is a clear proof of the fact that its Creator and its Lord is only one and not more than one. Secondly, there is the lesson that the power and majesty of God are so great that they can revivify a dead body; cause the growth of a lush green garden, and produce colour, fragrance and taste in dry and barren things. There is proof of unity in the first occurrence and the second one shows symbolically that for human souls also, there is similar godly ‘rain’, and that is ‘revelation’. One who wants to give a new life to his dead and dry soul, should have himself drenched in the rain of godly revelation.",
