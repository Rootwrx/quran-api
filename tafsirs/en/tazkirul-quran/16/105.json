  "text": "In Makkah there were some non-Arab slaves. In various books of tafsir (commentary) their names have been given as Jabr, Yasar, ‘A’ish, Ya‘ish, etc. (there is some mention also of Salman al-Farsi who later became a Muslim). These slaves being either Jews or Christians were very knowledgeable about the ancient holy religions of Judaism and Christianity. From time to time they chanced to meet the Prophet Muhammad. On the basis of such meetings, the Chiefs of the Quraysh started saying, ‘The non-Arabs tell Muhammad something and he presents it to the people, declaring it to be “divine discourse.’” Why was this ridiculous statement made by them? It was due to the same common wrong approach which is found in every period all over the world; i.e. the refusal to recognize the value of one who is one’s own contemporary. The Prophet Muhammad was a contemporary personality for the Quraysh, and therefore, they failed to appreciate him. This verse shows that those who feel nothing but contempt for their contemporaries can never be truly inspired to accept the Truth. Instead of accepting the Truth, they fabricate false allegations against the messengers of the Truth; ignoring the greater facts, they seize upon irrelevant things amounting to hair-splitting in order to defame the preacher. They spend their entire lives in this way until the day of their death when they will be punished by God.",
