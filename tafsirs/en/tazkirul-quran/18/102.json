  "text": "Acceptance of the Truth (Reality) is in fact acceptance of God, while denial of the truth is in fact denial of God. Whenever a person refuses to accept the Truth, he does so banking on the apparent strength of some thing or some personality. Such reliance is false, because in this world nobody has any power except God. On the Day of Judgement there will be nobody to save him, because God is the only saviour and such a person would already have lost His support due to his disobedience.",
