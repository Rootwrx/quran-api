  "text": "The truth which comes from God is the absolute truth. It cannot, therefore, be altered to suit personal vagaries. The amendment of God’s truth amounts to changing those standards on the basis of which tests will be undertaken and every person’s position will be determined. Those who want God’s truth to be altered with a view to legitimizing their behaviour, are actually adding insolence to misbehaviour. Such people should expect nothing but the severest punishment.",
