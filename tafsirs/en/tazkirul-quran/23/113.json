  "text": "That joy which is everlasting is the real joy. Fleeting moments of joy have no meaning. In the life of this world, man is forgetful of this fact. But in the Hereafter, it will become abundantly clear to him.  Truth manifests itself to a man in this world, but he does not want to disturb his status quo, so he does not accept it. He is not prepared to forego the already available present gain for the sake of any promised future gain. The comforts and the considerations of this world appear valuable to him and he is unable to understand why he should ignore them all and attach himself to a ‘non-thing,’ or abstract promise.",
