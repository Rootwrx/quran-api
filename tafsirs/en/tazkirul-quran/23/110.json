  "text": "During the life of this world, when the realities of the Hereafter were still hidden, there were still some servants of God who had recognised God in  all His Majesty and perfection. In spite of hearing the call for Truth in a purely abstract form, supported only by rational arguments, they believed in it. But they had to pay the price for believing in an alien Truth in that they became the subject of ridicule in their immediate surroundings. Despite this, they did not break off this attachment. Such steadfastness in thinking is the greatest form of patience and the reward for this is paradise in the life hereafter.",
