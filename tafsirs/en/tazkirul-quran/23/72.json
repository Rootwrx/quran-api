  "text": "A prophet does not anticipate any monetary gains from his addressee- community. The relationship between a prophet and his addressee-community is an extremely delicate one. If, on the one hand, the preacher gives the message of Truth and Hereafter, but at the same time seeks worldly benefits, his call for Truth will become ridiculous. This is why a prophet never makes any material demands upon his addressee-community, even though, due to this policy, he may himself have to suffer material loss. The real remuneration of such a preacher of Truth is Truth itself. His discovery of God is his greatest asset. The divine experiences which he gains while leading his life as a preacher provide the best nourishment to his soul. His striving to uphold and to inclucate the highest ideals is the biggest source of satisfaction to him. One who is ever anxious about the life Hereafter, will be the one who will give a positive response to the call for Truth. Realisation of the Hereafter makes a man serious, and seriousness is the sole factor which, with the support of convincing arguments, compels a man to accept the Truth.",
