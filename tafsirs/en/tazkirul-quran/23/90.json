  "text": "The nature of power is such that it does not tolerate division. If there are multiple power centres, each strives unceasingly to overpower the others. Now take a look at the universe. The stellar bodies follow their regime strictly and harmoniously. Had there been a separate god for every entity, each one would have distanced himself from the others along with his own part and no harmony would have existed among the different parts. Due to conflict among the various gods, the entire system of the universe would have been disturbed. Given the above, it is clear that the theory of the unity of Godhead is the Truth while the theory of polytheism stands discarded.",
