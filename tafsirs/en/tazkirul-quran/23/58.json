  "text": "One whose discovery of God is such that he is awe-struck by Him becomes different from other men, in that his God-fearing mentality makes him extremely serious. His seriousness guarantees that he fully realises the weight of divine proofs and he submits to God completely. In the present world, there are two ways in which a man may exert himself — one is the way of the world and the other is the way of the Hereafter. Those who possess the above-mentioned qualities, are exactly those who strive towards the Hereafter. However,  in the present world, to strive towards the Hereafter is an extremely difficult task. It is one in which a man is prone to different types of shortcomings. But, Almighty God’s requirement of every man is exactly commensurate with his capacity to fulfill it. Everybody’s capacity and performance are both completely within the knowledge of God and this very fact ensures that, on the Day of Judgement, everyone will receive whatever concession he is justifiably entitled to and everyone will receive the reward which he actually deserves.",
