  "text": "The Prophet Noah admonished his community for a long time. But his community was not ready to accept his call. At last he prayed, ‘Oh God! I have not been able to make my people accept the truth. Now, You reveal the truth to them!’ But when the outermost limit of human effort has been reached, Divine action begins. It is then the time for reckoning and not for advice or admonition. So, God’s retribution appeared in the shape of a devastating storm, which drowned Noah’s entire community, with the exception of a few believers in Noah. The refusal to acknowledge the Truth is the worst type of transgression. Those who indulge in this transgression are liable to be seized upon by God and then nothing can save them from their fate.",
