  "text": "Those completely devoted to the life of this world are not interested in any discourses about God or the Hereafter. Their interests are quite different from those of true men of faith. Talk of God and the Hereafter, however effectively presented, does not, therefore,  appeal to them. They ignore all such talk, and are lost in their worldly pursuits. But, with the onset of God’s retribution, such people forget their recklessness and arrogance and start pleading humbly. At that time they bow down before God. But, doing so at that juncture is useless, because only that submission before God carries weight which is done on seeing God’s sign. Bowing down when God Himself appears in all His Might, has no value.",
