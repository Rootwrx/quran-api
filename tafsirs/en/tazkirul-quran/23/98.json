  "text": "When God’s preacher calls for the Truth, it often happens that those whom he addresses, instead of acknowledging it, become his enemies. They make him the target of mischief and spread false propaganda against him. At that time, he has the urge to react. He feels that if he has been maltreated by others, he should also retaliate. He feels that if he keeps quiet, will be encouraged and they will be emboldened to engage in further opposition. But all such thoughts are instigations of Satan. At this critical juncture, Satan confuses the issue with a view to leading man astray. On such occasions, one who is a believer should seek God’s protection, will cast him into manifest error.",
