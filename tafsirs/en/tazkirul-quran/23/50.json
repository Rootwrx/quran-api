  "text": "The Messiah’s birth without a father was an extremely strange occurrence. Why did it take place? It came as a symbol or sign from God. In ancient times, the Jews enjoyed the position of being a prophet-raising community. But, having continuously indulged in arrogant behaviour, they forfeited this entitlement. The time had come for this trust to be taken away from them and handed over to another community, in this case, the Children of Ishmael. Therefore, as a way of bringing to a conclusion the religious predominance of the Jews, God caused their last prophet to be born in a miraculous manner and gave him some additional miracles to perform. The Jews, however, persisted in rejecting him, and this finally proved that they did not deserve to be a community into which prophets should be born. This was a very critical moment for the Messiah’s mother, Mary. In these circumstances, she was in dire need of a corner where she could live away from the eyes of the people, and where the necessities of life should be available in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. When Almighty God placed her in this critical position, He also provided for her a peaceful place near her home.",
