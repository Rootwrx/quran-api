  "text": "Moses and Aaron belonged to the Children of Israel. At that time, in Egypt, the Children of Israel served as labourers to the ruling community. The inferior position of the Children of Israel and the superior position of Pharaoh and his companions became a stumbling block in the latter’s acceptance of an Israeli prophet as God’s representative. Though Moses gave them strong proofs, they did not carry enough weight to persuade them to rein in their sense of superiority and simply accept the truth coming from an ‘inferior’ person. The result of this was that God Almighty finally gave His Prophet assistance and Pharaoh, despite all his power and its trappings, was engulfed in the Red Sea. Moreover, God favoured those who supported the Prophet by sending them a Book of Guidance, by following which a man might assure for himself success in this world and the Hereafter.",
