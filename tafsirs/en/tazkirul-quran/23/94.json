  "text": "This prayer illustrates that a believer is always a God-fearing man. Even when God’s punishment is directed towards others, he starts trembling with fear. He starts addressing God in all humility, because he knows that, if he is to be saved, it will not be by any deed of his or by his own strength but by God’s mercy.",
