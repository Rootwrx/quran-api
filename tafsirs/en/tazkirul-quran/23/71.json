  "text": "Truth is that which is in consonance with reality. But, those given to self-indulgence want the Truth to be made subservient to their desires. Therefore, when a preacher speaks of the Truth, they are unhappy with him. They do not want to be subservient to the Truth. They want the Truth to be subservient to them. On account of this mentality they do not pay any attention to the call of Truth. The Truth appears strange to them, and they are, therefore, unable to recognise the real position of the preacher. Indeed, in order to show that they are on the right path, they try to prove him wrong. In the universe, there appears to be perfect harmony. On the contrary, in the world of human beings one sees disturbance and turbulence everywhere. The reason for this situation is that the system of the universe is running on the basis of Truth (law of nature), i.e. whatever should happen actually happens, and whatever should not happen does not happen. If the system of the universe also started running on the basis of the desires of human beings, it would also become fraught with the same disturbance and turbulence as is found in the world of mankind. Advice and criticism are to most people unpalatable. There are very few individuals who listen to advice and criticism with an open mind. Many people just go through life ignoring it, hence shutting the door of development upon themselves.",
