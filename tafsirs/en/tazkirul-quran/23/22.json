  "text": "Man is a small creature. Compared to him, the universe is so large that it strikes terror into man. In the vastness of space, innumerable stars and planets revolve at high speed. Yet, the most wonderful aspect of the universe is that it is highly favourable to the existence of human beings. Moreover, exceptional the planet appear to have been made keeping all man’s needs in mind. For example, man is able to domesticate a variety of animals and put them to various uses. The cow’s stomach, for instance, is a wonderful factory which converts into a valuable commodity—milk. All these factors warrant man’s recognition of his Kind and Merciful God and his remaining ever grateful to Him.",
