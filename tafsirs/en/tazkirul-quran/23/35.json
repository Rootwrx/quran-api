  "text": "This verse refers to people’s utterances regarding the Hereafter—some implicit and others explicit. Sometimes a man is so completely engrossed in worldly pursuits, that he seems to become forgetful of the Hereafter, as if he considered it to be only a remote possibility. And, sometimes it happens that his neglect of the Hereafter takes him to the extreme limit of arrogance, to the extent that he is outspoken, openly expressing the view that one should seize upon whatever one can today, and not lose today’s certain benefits for the sake of tomorrow’s imaginary gains. Such people deride the Prophet by saying that he is an imposter who misrepresents God. Utterances such as these give people a reason for neglecting and ignoring the preacher of Truth.",
