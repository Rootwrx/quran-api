  "text": "When the religion of God is revived in its true spirit, it instills the fear of God in people’s minds but when religion loses its true spirit, it becomes a mere source of boasting and pride for its adherents. This is the time when men of religion split into a number of groups. Each group chooses for itself that aspect which feeds its pride. Groups which feed on pride are always many in number, while the religion of the God-fearing is always one. An absence of fear breeds a diversity of opinions, while a God-fearing mentality leads to uniformity of opinion. In the present world, man is being put to test. During the period of respite allowed to an individual or a group at God’s behest, all the amenities of life are provided. On account of this, negligent people think that whatever they are doing is right and that, if they had been wrong, their possessions and all comfort and convenience would have been snatched away from them. But, by God’s method, a man’s possession are taken away from him, not on his flouting God’s will during the trial period, but in the world hereafter.",
