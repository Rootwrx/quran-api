  "text": "After the advent of each prophet, the succeeding generations of his community were always led astray. In order to reform them, prophets were sent to them again and again. In Adam’s generation Noah appeared. In Noah’s generation (the ‘Ad), Hud appeared as a prophet. In Hud’s generation (the Thamud), Salih appeared. But on each occasion those who had accepted the prophet of the past without question, were the very same people who were not at all prepared to accept the prophet of their own times. The reason for this is that the prophet of the past, as a result of a wealth of traditions surrounding him, ultimately becomes a symbol of national pride, or national identity. He assumes the status of a national hero. By accepting him, one’s superiority complex is satisfied. Obviously, who will refuse to accept such a prophet? But, the case of the prophet during his lifetime is just the opposite. He has neither any halo of history around him nor any traditions of greatness to enhance his persona. Accepting him amounts to accepting an invisible reality. This is why those who accepted the prophet of the past have always refused to accept the prophet of their own times. ‘So away with the people who will not believe!’ Those referred to in this injunction are people who could recognize God’s emissary only when, as a result of historical process, he had become their national hero.",
