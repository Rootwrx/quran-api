  "text": "‘Believers,’ here refer to those who embraced the faith of Jesus. Those who had faith in the previous prophet and now, having discovered the Truth in the call of the Last of the Prophets, adopt his faith, are entitled to a double reward. Similarly, if those who are Muslims by birth study Islam afresh, and with renewed Islamic consciousness, become believers or Muslims, they too will be entitled to a double reward in the eyes of God.",
