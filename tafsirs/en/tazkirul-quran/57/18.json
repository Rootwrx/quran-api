  "text": "To give one’s possessions to others and to spend on the requirements of religion are very great deeds. Those who spend like this, whether men or women, have proved their steadfastness in faith. In an atmosphere of doubt about the Truth, they were able to see the Truth. Such action on their part will become a beacon for them in the Hereafter. They will be treated as accepters of God’s signs. They will be given the status of God’s witnesses, i.e. presenters of the report of the deeds of the people in the Court of the Hereafter.",
