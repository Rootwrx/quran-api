  "text": "When these verses were revealed, though Islam had not yet become a substantial power, it nevertheless had the full force of arguments and warnings behind it. Under these circumstances, one who did not feel the force of arguments and was not moved by Divine warnings is shown, by this, that he was suffering from a lack of awareness. Just as the earth becomes fresh and green when it receives water, so also should the individual awaken from his moral torpor when he hears clear arguments. How strange it is if he does not.",
