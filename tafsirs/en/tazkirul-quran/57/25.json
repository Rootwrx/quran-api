  "text": "Two things are required in religion. One is the following of religion and the other is the support of religion. The balance—or the Scales of Justice—is a symbol of the following of religion by its adherents. Just as man measures excess or shortage by means of a balance, similarly, God’s book is also a balance for Truth. People should test their actions against the standard of God’s book and find out how far they are right and how far they are wrong. Similarly, iron is the symbolic representation of the support for religion. Whenever, any problem about religion arises, a man should prove as strong as iron. He should defend religion with the strength of iron.",
