  "text": "This Universe is an introduction to its Creator. Its terrifying vastness reveals the majesty of its Creator. The utter perfection of its harmony indicates that its Creator is a perfect and complete being. The perfect co-ordination between its various parts proves that the Being who controls it is extremely wise and all-knowing. The fact of the Universe being extremely congenial and conducive to the nourishment of human life clearly shows that its Creator is extremely kind and merciful towards His creation. One who ponders over the mysteries of the Universe will be totally absorbed in the realization of Godâ€™s majesty and perfection. He will be convinced that from the beginning of time till the end of eternity, all majesty pertains to the one and only God and to no other than Him.",
