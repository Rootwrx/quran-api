  "text": "Godâ€™s power is not outwardly visible. But the power of human beings is plainly visible. For this reason, those who are concerned only with appearances are fearless of God, but if they come across a human being who is stronger than the others, they feel afraid of him. Their lack of awareness with regard to God creates in them a lack of consciousness of the world also. Those who become united for some negative purpose cannot remain united for long, because, for the purpose of long-lasting unity, a positive basis is required and that is precisely what they do not have.",
