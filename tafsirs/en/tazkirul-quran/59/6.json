  "text": "When the enemy have fled after defeat, their possessions are considered spoils of war (ghanimah). Sometimes the enemy retreats without fighting. On such occasions the booty acquired is described as abandoned property (fayâ€™). As for the spoils of war, after a fifth part has been taken out, all of the remaining portion is  the share of the army. While all the abandoned property in the case of Fay belongs to the Islamic government and is to be spent in the public interest. It is the intention of Islam that wealth should not remain restricted to a particular class but should reach every class. In Islam, there is no concept of economy controlled by the State. However, its economic rules are so framed that wealth should not be concentrated,  but should keep circulating in all groups.",
