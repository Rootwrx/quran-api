  "text": "After the hijrah, the Muslims who left their native place and migrated to Madinah were in reality a burden on the inhabitants of Madinah, who were known as ‘helpers’ (ansar). But the helpers open-heartedly welcomed the migrants (muhajirun). Wherever the Prophet of God received any bounty, he shared it out among the migrants. In spite of that the Muslims of Madinah did not bear the migrants any ill-will. Ultimately, they fully acknowledged the migrants’ services to Islam and used to pray for them from the bottom of their hearts. It is such broad-mindedness which will assure a group an honoured place in the annals of history.",
