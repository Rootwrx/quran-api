  "text": "Human life is divided into two parts: ‘today’ and ‘tomorrow’. The present world is a man’s ‘today’ and the world of the Hereafter is man’s ‘tomorrow’. Whatever a man does in the present world, he has to face the basic consequences in the ensuing longer life. This is the truth and the other name for it is Islam. Man’s success depends upon his always keeping this reality in mind. The whole life of one who is forgetful of this, will go wrong. In this matter, there is no difference between a believer or a non-believer. Believers will have the advantage only if they acknowledge realities. If they become forgetful of them, they will also meet the same fate as their  precursors.",
