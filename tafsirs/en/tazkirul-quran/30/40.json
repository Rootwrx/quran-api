  "text": "If human beings adopt the one God as their object of worship, then everyone’s centre of attention is one. This creates an atmosphere of unity among human beings. On the contrary, if numerous entities are made objects of worship, and people individually worship different things, their attention becomes divided. Because of this, differences amounting to enmity develop between individuals and nations.  The land, the sea and the atmosphere become fraught with discord. The end result of man’s wrongdoing will appear after death. But the temporary  result of man’s wrongdoing is shown in this world for the time being, purely to serve as an admonishment and a warning.",
