  "text": "When a man is born, he is but a weak child. Then after experiencing the strength of youth, followed by middle age, he again faces the weakness of old age. This means that a man’s strength is not his own. He receives it when it is given to him. It is in the power of the Giver to give when He likes and take away when He likes. In the life of this world, man cares nothing for the Hereafter, because the Day of Judgement appears to be very far away. But, this is only due to his ignorance. When the Day of Judgement arrives, —the stage for the next world—he will feel as if he had lived in the previous world for only a moment.",
