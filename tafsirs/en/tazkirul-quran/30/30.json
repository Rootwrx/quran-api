  "text": "The true religion is one, and it has been revealed in its perfect form to every prophet. That religion is turning towards God, fear of God, worship of God and giving one’s attention to God with all one’s heart and soul. This is the religion of nature and it eternally pervades the inner soul of man. All prophets preached this one religion, but their followers in latter generations split it into many religions. This results from the additions made by later generations  to the original teachings of Prophets. Hair-splitting innovations in beliefs, new interpretations of religion with the changing times—all these things have created many religions out of one. When these additions are made people start laying more stress on them than on the original religion, due to which different groups set themselves up in opposition to each other. One group emphasizes one set of additions, while another group empasizes another set. At last a stage is reached when the followers of a single religion become divided up into many religious factions.",
