  "text": "Man wants to earn more and more so that he may accumulate more and more material assets. He remains immersed in that thought till the day he dies. After his death, man realises that what was worth accumulating was something else. But the realization after death will be of no avail. Any increase in worldly goods increases a manâ€™s accountability. But man, in his foolishness, thinks that he is adding to his success.",
