  "text": "In the present world, people have been given a certain amount of liberty as a means of putting them to the test. Man takes this trial-oriented freedom as the real freedom. This is the greatest illusion. All human evils are born out of this illusion. Apparently, it seems that a man is free to do whatever he likes in this world and there is nobody to check him. But the fact remains that a very difficult period is awaiting him, when even father and son will not be able to support one another. Isn’t asking the question, ‘If Judgement Day is coming, then when is it going to come?’ transgressing human limits? Man is unaware of the immediate future of the known and familiar things surrounding him. For instance, he is unable to make an accurate prediction about the rains, the growth of a baby in the mother’s womb, his future earnings, the time of his death, etc. Despite his limited knowledge, man accepts these facts as realities. Similarly, man should believe in the coming of the Day of Judgement on the basis of the brief indications he has of it.",
