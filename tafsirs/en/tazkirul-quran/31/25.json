  "text": "The universe is so extensive and so great that no one can claim that anybody other than God has created it. But despite accepting this fact, manâ€™s tragedy is that he gives to things other than God, a place of prominence and greatness. This irrational behaviour is otherwise known as polytheism, or ascribing partners to God (shirk). The Majesty of God is too great to be expressed in words. The history of physical sciences is spread over thousands of years. But, in spite of innumerable researches, there are still many things about which it has not been possible to obtain complete information. For example man does not know the exact number of stars that exist in space, nor the number of species of animals and vegetation found on the earth. He remains unaware about the true nature and composition of the leaf of a tree or a grain of sand or even the many wonders hidden in the sea. In short, there are few things, big or small, in this world, about which man has obtained full information. This in itself is enough to prove that if all the trees of the world are chiselled into pens and all the seas become the ink, it will still not suffice to record the innumerable feats of God.",
