  "text": "Man’s existence in itself is the proof of creation. And when one’s existence is possible, the coming into existence of other lives is equally possible. It is on a parallel with man’s experience of hearing one voice and seeing one scene, which leads him to feel that it should be possible to hear many voices and see many scenes. The merging of night into day and day into night is the visible manifestation of what is known in the present age as the axial rotation of the earth. The continuous rotation of the earth on its axis with perfect precision and several other events of similar type show that the Creator and Lord of this Universe is unimaginably great. In these circumstances, who else can be worshipped except He? And who can be given the place of supreme importance in one’s life? The fact is that giving a position of greatness to anybody other than God is nothing but falsehood, because nobody except God possesses greatness.",
