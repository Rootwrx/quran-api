  "text": "The universe exists in infinite space. In it the continuous revolving of innumerable large stellar bodies is a great and awe-inspiring feature. In this universe, the earth is an extremely exceptional sphere, upon which numerous factors and arrangements have made human life possible. Among these arrangements are the maintenance of balance by the rising mountains on the earth, and also the plentiful existence of valuable things like water, greenery, etc. There is nobody except Almighty God who can manage this huge system. As such, is it legitimate for man to worship things other than God?",
