  "text": "If sea-bound vessels safely transport passengers and goods without any fear of sinking, it is thanks to Almighty God who endowed man with the skills to build seaworthy ships and gave him the knowledge about winds and currents. Undoubtedly, this is a great sign. But only patient and grateful people can learn a lesson from it. A patient person is one who abstains from being influenced by improper feelings and a grateful person is one who is capable of admitting the truth that exists beyond his realm. However, if the ship gets caught in stormy weather and the sea becomes rough, then the shipsâ€™ crews and passengers realize their utter helplessness. At that time, they forget the awe of the so-called great and start calling out to God alone. People should derive a lesson from the above experience and remain steadfast on the path of Truth and justice, but there are very few people who actually do so. Many people habitually remember God when in trouble and as the matter improves, they revert to their ways of arrogance and ingratitude.",
