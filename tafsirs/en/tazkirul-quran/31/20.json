  "text": "The present world has been made in such a way that it is entirely favourable to human existence. That is, the present world contains in abundance everything which a human being needs. In spite of this, man is not thankful to the Creator of the universe. Indulging in useless discussions, he wants to turn people’s attention away from God. Generally, the reason for a man’s going astray is that he does not use his mind. He does not think of getting out of the rut of common customs. If a man rises above those rigid customs, the mind given to him by God, will be enough to lead him in the right direction.",
