  "text": "If a son is ill or if there is a daughter’s marriage, at such a time nobody spares himself or his money. If such an occasion arises, he will sacrifice his life and his wealth for the sole purpose if being of use to his kinsfolk. This is the time to do one’s utmost rather than sheltering behind excuses. The truly religious individual, however, will never put forward excuses, when some occasion arises which demands sacrifice for religion. The restless emotions of faith in his heart await such a crucial moment when he will have the occasion to sacrifice himself and prove his loyalty before God. Then, such an occasion having arisen, how would such a person try to hide behind an excuse? The benefits of the Hereafter not being present before a human being, he entertains doubts about undertaking any sacrifices for it. But to tear off this veil of doubt is the real test of man in this world.",
