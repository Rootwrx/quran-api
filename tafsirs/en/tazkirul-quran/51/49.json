  "text": "The system of our world is a highly meaningful one. This proves that the creation of the present world has been brought about with some high purpose. But we see that man has wrecked disorder on the earth. In the meaningful universe, this meaningless development is incongrous and calls for a world which is free of all evils to come into existence. In the present world provision has already been made for this, i.e. all things in this world come in pairsâ€”in matter, positive and negative particles, in plants male and female and among human beings, men and women. This is the quintessence of the universe: the prevalence of the law of compensating for the shortcomings of any given thing through its pair or complement. This duality is an indication of the possibility of the Hereafter. In other words, the world of Hereafter is the other part which makes up a pair with the present world and this combination makes our world complete.",
