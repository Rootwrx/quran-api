  "text": "Whenever a preacher of truth, who represents a religion free of human interpolation, calls upon the people to the true religion, he has to face the obstructive attitude of those already in possession of hallowed religious seats. Such a preacher is all alone, without any powerful supports, unlike those occupying high religious positions. This difference results in misunderstanding, so that those in power come to regard the preacher as a totally worthless person. They even go to the extent of wanting to expel him from their town or city. Such people tend to forget that this earth has been created by God. Therefore, trying to harm the preacher of truth amounts to proving themselves sinners in God’s eyes. Moreover, expelling God’s preacher from any human settlement is the equivalent of expelling a representative of the government of the time. Such an expulsion serves only to condemn the expeller. Whenever a man wants to belittle another, it is he himself who is belittled in the eyes of the Lord of the world. For it is the Lord who has the actual power to elevate His creatures in status or lay them low.",
