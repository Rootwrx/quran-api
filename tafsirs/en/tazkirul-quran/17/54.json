  "text": "When a preacher calls for the truth and his hearers pay no attention to him, then certainly the preacher becomes exasperated, especially when the truth is as clear as daylight. Sometimes, he is so irritated that he cannot but vent his anger on the addressees by saying that they are not going to receive God’s mercy. Such words as these do not befit a preacher. He does not have permission from God to utter such words. Conveying the message of truth is one thing and meting out the divine reward according to the response given to the call of truth, another. The first is the task of a preacher and the second, that of God. A preacher should never make the mistake of crossing the limits set for him by entering the sphere reserved for God. Similarly, it happens sometimes that the preacher and the addressees engage in arguments regarding which of their respective prophets is the superior one. The energies of each side are then spent on proving that their own prophet enjoys a higher status with God, with the result that the discussion, which should have been focused on the principles of the prophet’s message, is instead focused on personalities. This awakens in them feelings of prejudice and, as a result, places further obstacles in the path of the acceptance of the truth. Hence the explanation given in these verses that it is a matter pertaining to God as to what status He grants to His servants. What preachers have to do is avoid such heated discussions on irrelevant topics and convey the real message of truth to the people.",
