  "text": "Whenever an orphan’s property is entrusted to the next of kin—the orphan being under age or not having reached maturity—it is incumbent upon the relatives to keep the orphan’s wealth intact and, as soon as he is able to understand matters of profit and loss, to hand over to him his entire wealth. Keeping promises is a sign of nobility of character. One, who makes a pledge, but does not fulfill it, is a worthless person before God and men. Literally ‘a pledge must be accounted for to God’. These words make it quite clear that if one man makes a promise to another, it does not concern just the two of them: God actively participates in the capacity of the third party. One who breaks his pledge to someone weaker than himself should fear God—who is also present—for it is quite impossible to escape His wrath.",
