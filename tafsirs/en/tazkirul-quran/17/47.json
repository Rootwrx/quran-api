  "text": "The call of the Prophet Muhammad was supported by such strong arguments that the common people of Arabia were awed by it. Seeing this, the Arab leaders felt afraid that, if the majority of the people converted to the new religion, their leadership would come to an end. They, therefore, employed a strategy to keep people away from it. They said that the great impact the Prophetâ€™s words had was due to his being possessed. They said, moreover, that the power of his words did not stem from his having discovered some truth, but from his possessing magical powers. That is, it was a mere matter of oratorical prowess rather than the communication of truth. In this way the majestic words of the Quran reflecting Truth came to mean to them a magic spell wrought by an individual. Those who fail to judge such a call on the basis of its merit but look at it rather from the point of view of whether the words of the call support or reject their own stand, shall never succeed in finding the truth.",
