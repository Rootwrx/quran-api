  "text": "The Quran is a declaration of pure truth. The communication of the pure truth amounts to adversely affecting the interests of all those who follow such ‘truth’ as has been vitiated by human interpolation. But when the pure truth is laid before those whose thinking is realistic, it is accepted by them as their absolute standard or criterion, as opposed to following their own instincts. They mould themselves to the truth instead of moulding the truth to themselves. Owing to their sincerity and realistic thinking, the Quran becomes a blessing for them. Unlike them are the arrogant ones who think that they are great, because of their particular mindset. When the truth comes to them in its pure form, their minds function in the wrong direction. They fail to understand that, if they adopted the truth, they would become right-minded persons. On the contrary, they believe that if they accepted the truth presented by someone else, they would become diminished in stature. So, in order to satisfy their egos, they are ready to belittle the truth by refusing to accept it, and attempting to show that it is not worth accepting.",
