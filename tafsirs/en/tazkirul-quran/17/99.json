  "text": "The earth and the sky exist before us as an undeniable reality. Their existence proves that there is a living being who has the power to create something out of nothing. When this initial creation is possible, why should there not be a second creation? The truth is that after accepting the first creation, no scientific, rational argument comes in the way of believing in the second creation. In the face of such clear evidence, anyone who does not accept the second creation is a transgressor. He treads on the ground of stubbornness instead of on the ground of reason and rationality.",
