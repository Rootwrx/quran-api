  "text": "The Quran used to be revealed to the Prophet Muhammad at particular times. Apart from this, the Prophet had no power to compose words such as those of the Quran; his own personal way of expressing himself was always quite different in style. The Prophet was quite disturbed when for a long time no revelations were made to him. But it was not possible for him to compose verses like those of the Quran on his own or with the help of his Companions. It is a fact that there is a great difference between the language and style of the Hadith and the Quran. This difference can be seen even today by any Arabic scholar. This is a clear proof of the fact that the Quran is not a composition of the Prophet Muhammad: it has come from a mind far superior to the human mind. Those who believed that the Quran was composed of human words, were asked to compose such words as those of the Quran. If what they believed was true, and it was a human composition, they too should have had the power to compose such scriptures. They might even seek the help of others, and strive to produce verses like those of the Quran. But no one was able to answer this challenge at that time. Even in later times, no stylist or scholar has been able to produce any composition paralleling the verses of the Quran. Events show that a number of people did in fact strive very hard, but they could not produce a single verse like that of the Quran.",
