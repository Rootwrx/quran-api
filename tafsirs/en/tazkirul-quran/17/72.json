  "text": "In this world all human groups have their leaders. Similarly, in the Hereafter all groups will be rated along with their respective leaders—good people with their good leaders and evil people with their evil leaders. Subsequently, everyone will be given a full record of his deeds in the world he left behind. The record of good people will be placed in their right hands while the record of bad people will be placed in their left hands. This will serve as a tangible sign that the first group is God’s favoured group and the second is the disfavoured group. The division between bad and good in the Hereafter will be on the basis of who lead his life in this world like a deaf and blind man and who lead his life in this world like one possessed of sight. Since God does not converse with man directly in this world, His messages have to be learned through the silent signs of this universe and through the words of God’s messengers. Those who apprehend this indirect communication of the divine message will be regarded as possessing sight in this world. And those who do not understand this ‘indirect language’ and wait for the day when God Himself will appear and speak, are the ones who are blind in the eyes of God. Ultimately, the direct words of God will be of no avail to them. They will remain as far from the reality of truth at that time as they are today.",
