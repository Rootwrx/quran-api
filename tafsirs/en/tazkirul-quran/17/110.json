  "text": "Those who have not found the truth at a deeper level always find themselves embroiled in petty, superficial things. Some hold that God should be called by one name, others by another name. Some hold that the words of devotions should be uttered loudly, others that they be uttered quietly. The Arabs were engaged in such debates and discussions in different ways. God said that all His names were good. He might be called by any of His names. Similarly, acts of devotion are not to be judged by quiet or loud utterances, but rather by the spirit they evince. The spirit of prayer is one of a deep consciousness of God’s greatness. Belief in God should become akin to discovering a perfect and great Being, who is independent of any help from anyone; who has no equal and no partner. When this discovery finds words and comes to the lips of the believer, it is called celebration of God’s greatness (takbir).",
