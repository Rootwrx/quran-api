  "text": "Every kind of business in the world is based on weights and measures. Therefore, it has been ordained that weights and measures should be accurate. There are two aspects to this. First, it is in accordance with human dignity, for the giving of short weight is a debasement of character. The second great merit is that it gives a stimulus to business, as total trust is the foundation of commercial progress. Proper weight and measurement are a sine qua non for the establishment of good business relations in any given society.",
