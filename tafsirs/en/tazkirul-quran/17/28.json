  "text": "A man has a right to spend on himself whatever he earns by his own hard work. However, the Islamic law lays down that he should avoid the habits of a spendthrift; he should spend his wealth on actual necessities and not on vanity or display. Secondly, everyone must realize that others have a right to his earnings—be they relatives, neighbours, travellers or needy persons. If one is to spend one’s wealth according to the will and pleasure of God, one must first of all economize by refraining from pointless spending. Indeed, extravagance is a weapon used by Satan to induce one to neglect one’s duties towards the poor and needy.",
