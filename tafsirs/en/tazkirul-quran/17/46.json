  "text": "When the Quran is recited to people, they fail to understand the message due to their deep conditioning. In fact, they are so frivolous about the world hereafter, that they ignore the message altogether. People are so involved in their worldly matters that truth is no longer their concern. Their reluctance is due to the fact that they do not want to revise themselves. The call of pristine truth always negates their worldly concerns. That is why they are greatly provoked on hearing this call. In their hearts they do not believe in the accountability of the Day of Judgement and this makes them non-serious in their approach to it. The mind which lacks seriousness is incapable of understanding anything of value.",
