  "text": "The injunctions given in the above verses come under the heading of ‘wisdom’ (hikmah). The meaning of ‘wisdom’ here stands for the firm reality, the sound truths of life. It is on the foundations of these realities that the healthy life is built. A human society devoid of them can expect little else but annihilation both in the present and in the next life. The narration of the above-mentioned advice begins with the Oneness of God, or tawhid (verse 22) and finishes with the oneness of God (verse 39). This indicates that, for the foundation of all good deeds, man should believe in the one God. He should fear and love Him alone. The secret of a good life is concealed in the right relationship with God. If the relationship with God is not proper, no other thing can set right the affairs of human life. God is the beginning and the end of human life.",
