  "text": "The actual point of the divine task undertaken by the Prophet Muhammad in Makkah was that God is only one and anything else worshipped by people in the form of idols is false; although the Makkans acknowledged a greater God, they believed in other gods as well. Who were these other gods? They were their leaders and past and present saints whom they regarded as sacred. They made stone images of them and started bowing before them. The call of monotheism given by the Prophet Muhammad struck at this belief in these revered personalities and so they asked the Prophet to make some compromises. They said that they would accept his deity only if the Prophet stopped criticizing their deities. In this world one who speaks out against the sacred men of others becomes an object of their anger. On the contrary, the easiest way to endear oneself to them is to endorse their saintly men. But the way of the Prophet was to announce the truth without caring whether or not it was going to have an adverse effect upon the sacredness of their supposed deities. The actual aim of spreading the word of God is to communicate the truth in its entirety. That is why no concession can be made in this matter. Whether it is a prophet or an ordinary person who comes forward to proclaim the truth, he has to represent it exactly as it is, without resorting to any compromises, even if it is at the cost of losing all friends and supporters.",
