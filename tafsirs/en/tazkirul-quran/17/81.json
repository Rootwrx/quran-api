  "text": "The Quraysh leaders wanted to denigrate the Prophet Muhammad by heaping all kinds of blame and abuses upon him, but God’s plan was to grant him an exalted status. This divine plan materialised, by God’s will, in the form of favourable circumstances being produced in Madinah to coincide with the Prophet’s emigration to this city. According to the divine plan, the majority of the Madinans took no time in converting to Islam as a result of the efforts made by the Prophet and his Companions to spread the word of God. Finally, Makkah was conquered and then the whole of Arabia surrendered to Islam. This was the divine plan that has been expressed in the Quran in the form of a prayer enjoined upon the Prophet.",
