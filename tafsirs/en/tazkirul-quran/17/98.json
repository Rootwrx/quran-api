  "text": "In this world man leads his life according to his material status. In the Hereafter he will rise or fall according to his spiritual status. That is why those who went astray in this world will be raised on Doomsday as blind, deaf and dumb. Their straying resulted from their not using their eyes, ears and tongues towards the end for which they were intended. They did not see the signs of God. They did not pay heed to the evidence of God. They did not speak out in support of the truth, in spite of being able to see, hear and speak. So far as the truth was concerned, they were as if without eyes, ears, and tongue. After death when they reach the next world, they will find themselves in their real face. In this world they are given everything without deserving it; it is like having an unreal face which they have received in this world purely on a temporary basis, because the present life is a period of trial. There are two types of misguided people, one uttering words of insolence, like ‘How can we be resurrected when we have crumbled to dust?’, the other acting in such a way as to convey the same sentiments. The latter are those who do not properly use their eyes, ears, or tongues: they use these things against the very purpose of creation, then they blissfully imagine that their actions will have no consequences in the Hereafter.",
