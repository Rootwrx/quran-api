  "text": "Man’s first existence clearly proves the possibility of his second existence, or re-creation, on the Day of Judgement. One who believes in the first creation of man has no real argument to back up his denial of man’s second creation in the Hereafter. Furthermore, the concept of man’s second creation is not at all difficult to understand for those who regard human beings as an amalgam of material elements, for the cells in the human body keep on breaking down and being replaced by new ones. In this world known to us, man’s material existence is repeatedly terminated only to be rebuilt again and again through this continuous replacement of cells. In this way, man’s body continually renews itself. It is said that every ten years the cells in our body replace themselves and a new body comes into being. The truth is what we already believe in and comprehend before death through our knowledge of the functioning of cells, i.e. what we have time and again experienced before death. Doomsday is, in actual fact, the name of that day when the veil of the unseen is torn asunder and God in all His Power and Majesty appears before us. When this happens, the deniers will also be compelled to do what a true believer does today, namely, believe in God and life in the Hereafter. At that time all humanity will rush towards God in acknowledgement of His power and greatness.",
