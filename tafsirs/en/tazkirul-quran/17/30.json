  "text": "Islam favours moderation in all matters. According to Islam, the middle way, i.e. avoidance of extremes, is the best way. ‘The best of matters is their moderation.’ The same advice has been given in respect of expenditure. Man should not be so niggardly as to degrade himself in the eyes of others, but neither should he spend so much as to leave himself with nothing. It has been recorded in the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, that one who adopts the way of moderation will not be a pauper. Lack of moderation with regard to wealth generally develops in a man because he loses sight of the fact that the Giver is God. It is He Who in His wisdom gives less to one and more to another. God’s dictum on this subject has been recorded in a divinely inspired tradition (hadith qudsi) of the Prophet Muhammad, ‘There are some among My servants for whom poverty is better, that is, too much of wealth will lead them astray. If I were to make them wealthy, their faith would suffer. And there are some among My servants for whom being wealthy is better. If I were to make them paupers, their faith would suffer.’",
