  "text": "It is stated in the Quran that Satan had become man’s enemy from the very first day. He dissuaded Adam’s progeny from adopting the right path by his glib and deceitful talk. Man should therefore be wary of Satan and try to save himself from his evil designs. Satan pursues man at all times and, surreptitiously entering his thoughts, manages to misguide him. Man must save himself from Satan and his promptings.",
