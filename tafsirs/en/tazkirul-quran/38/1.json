  "text": "The Quran calls upon people to accept the realities that already exist in human nature. No statement of the Quran has so far been found to be against facts, which is sufficient to prove the veracity of the Quran. If people still do not accept the Quran, their rejection is certainly not based on arguments, but stems from the fear that they may lose their sense of self-importance if they accept a greater Truth.",
