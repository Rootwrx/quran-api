  "text": "A man has to make the journey of faith in a world where he might be hurt in many ways, both by his own people as well as strangers. But under no circumstances should he fall prey to negative thoughts. He should rather confront every difficult situation as it comes and keep going on. He might be even provoked, but nonetheless he should restrain himself. He should bear every setback without resorting to vengeance. There might be many an occasion when his heart, unable to take any more suffering might tell him to break the bonds of God and act as his heart bids him. Still, the fear of God should stop him from taking such a step even then. The demands of religion inevitably require the ultimate sacrifice—which would mean sacrificing one’s life and wealth. In such a situation, one has to uphold religion by making sacrifices for its cause, though that might mean adopting the most difficult of the courses open to one. On the journey of faith, this is a tremendous test of courage and high-mindedness. Indeed, becoming a true believer is a trial which requires patience and piety. One who successfully qualifies in this test is the believer for whom the gates of Paradise will be thrown open in the Hereafter.",
