  "text": "Those who do not adopt the religion of sacrifice justify their stand in various ways. For instance, they say, ‘This wealth has been granted to us by God. Then why should we not spend it for our personal needs and worldly comforts?’ Sometimes their insensitivity leads them to such extremes that they attempt to discredit the preacher himself on one pretext or the other, or by trying to find loopholes in his message. The need for them to sacrifice their lives and wealth does not arise, if they can prove that the preacher is not a genuine one. These justifications appear to be in the form of valid arguments but, in fact, they are only excuses to avoid fulfilling the requirements of faith. Therefore, whatever truth is presented, they will always find words to counter the preacher’s arguments, and to justify their own actions. These people are oblivious of the fact that their final end is death. And death will completely overturn the whole state of affairs. It will nullify all the false props. Then man will find himself standing at exactly that point where he actually is and not where he has shown himself to be. In other words, he will be cut down to size. Success and failure in this world are one and the same thing in terms of reality. Neither are the blessings of this world a proof of one’s being in the right, nor are the difficulties, problems and setbacks of this world a proof of one’s being in the wrong. Both are forms of divine trial and not signs of one’s spiritual advancement or decline.",
