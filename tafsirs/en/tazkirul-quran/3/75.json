  "text": "Being particularly chosen to represent His religion is one of the special blessings of God. Such a choice is not based on one’s belonging to a certain community. The recipient of this blessing is one whom God selects for his spiritual virtues. And God likes one who is so attached to Him and who so fears Him that He becomes his Keeper, and his Lord in the true sense of these words. Indeed, when the believer enters into a covenant with his Creator, he is not able to go back. God’s chosen servants are those who fulfill their trusts and do not break their promises. It is people such as these who are showered with God’s blessings. On the contrary, those who are careless in the fulfillment of trusts and are negligent about keeping their promises are of no value in the eyes of God. They will be denied God’s mercies and blessings.",
