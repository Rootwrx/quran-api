  "text": "The responsible life of the believers deprives them of any liberties that might be taken with the self. In their mission of communicating the Truth, many of their hearers turn hostile when they find that the success of such a mission entails a negation of their own existence. This state of affairs sometimes becomes so calamitous that believers are rendered homeless in their own homeland, having to suffer the oppression of their opponents. If they adopt the divine religion, it must be at the cost of their lives and property. In order to succeed in these tests, the believers should never place the considerations of this world above those of the Hereafter. Difficulties and unpleasantness should be suffered patiently. Negative feelings should be suppressed and any reaction should be refrained from. Believers must remain steadfast in their encounters with their opponents. It is this steadfastness, which draws Godâ€™s succour towards them. Besides this, it is necessary that all believers be united, joining together to face enemy onslaughts with all the strength of perfect union. Faith is in fact a test of patience, and only those who fear God can pass this test.",
