  "text": "The love of wealth and children becomes an obstacle to accepting a religion, which entails all kinds of sacrifices. And adherence to God’s religion is not a matter of engaging in hollow pretences of piety carried out in the public eye. Just as a gust of chill air ravages the whole harvest, so will the tempest of the Last Day (qiyamah) render valueless all such ostentatious acts. There were some among the Jews who believed in the Prophet Muhammad. And a few God-fearing people are more precious in the eyes of God than a host of ungodly people. But merely being a member of a community formed of one race in the name of a prophet, is not enough to earn one salvation. What is actually required of an individual is that he binds himself by a covenant with God. By ‘covenant’ is meant faith—the sacred bond between God and man. That is to say, personal actions and not community relationship make one deserving of God’s mercy and blessings. All the responsibilities that faith implies are included in this pledge. Remembering God in one’s solitude, worshipping Him, leading one’s life keeping in view the Hereafter, enjoining goodness upon the people around one, discouraging people from committing evil, working unstintingly for the cause of God—all such actions fulfill the divine covenant. Those who follow such a course are upright people in the eyes of God. God has full knowledge of their actions, for which He will reward them, and He will greatly honour them on the Day of Judgement.",
