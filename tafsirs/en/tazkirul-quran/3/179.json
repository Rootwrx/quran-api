  "text": "Having faith implies not being obsessed with one’s own self. Such an obsession amounts to assigning the position of greatness to one’s own self rather than to God. A believer should not be engrossed in the world, as this would mean that he did not attach real importance to the Hereafter. A believer should eschew arrogance, miserliness, injustice, and even love for and deep attachment to anything other than God. He should instead adopt the ways of God-worship, humility, generosity and justice. This would show that he is sincere in his faith and that he has actually dedicated himself to God and the Hereafter. Failure to do so means that he is not sincere in his faith. In spite of a formal acceptance of faith, he would in fact be living in this world very much like the non-believers. The division into good and bad souls in the Hereafter will be based on reality rather than on ostentatious behaviour. We find that wicked people too have been given full freedom. But it is only so that they can reveal their entirely perverse nature (what lies within them). Yet, however hard they may try, they can never succeed in vanquishing the believers. They have the power to use their freedom only where they themselves are concerned, not against others.",
