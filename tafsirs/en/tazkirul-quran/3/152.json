  "text": "When believers show steadfastness at crucial moments, God sends His special succour, that is, He strikes terror into the hearts of those who deny the truth. Any person or group who adheres to anything other than the true divine religion is standing in fact on quicksand. For, there is no other real base to build on in this world except the truth revealed by God. As such, whenever one has proved to be standing firmly on the ground of Godâ€™s religion, the ranks of those who deny the truth begin to show signs of disarray. Lacking sound arguments, those who deny the truth, unlike the believers, suffer from feelings of uncertainty and inferiority. This lack of conviction finally leads to their downfall. They are ultimately defeated at the hands of true believers. But in the case of the Muslims, their weakness and defeat are traceable solely to their disunity arising from dissension. Yet unity cannot come about in a society solely on the basis of uniformity of opinion. It takes united action also, even in the face of divisive opinions, to ensure total cohesiveness within a community. Only when a community thinks on this level can it remain united and powerful. When people start breaking up into factions, just because of disagreements, the resulting weakness will most certainly lead to defeat.",
