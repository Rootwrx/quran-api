  "text": "One comes to be called a believer by just repeating some words (kalimah), but so far as God is concerned, the would-be Muslim becomes a believer only when he sacrifices his life and his wealth for His cause. Without such a sacrifice, nobody’s faith is credible in the eyes of God. One thinks that by safeguarding one’s money one is safeguarding one’s worldly future. But man’s real future is that which pertains to the Hereafter. And money amassed for worldly purposes will only prove to be a curse for the hoarder.",
