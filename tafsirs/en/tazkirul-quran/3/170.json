  "text": "The martyrdom of the believers was derided by the hypocrites. They said that Muslims were being slain meaninglessly at the instance of their leader—the Prophet. God says that, on the contrary, what they call death is in fact the true, real life, which they have entered through the gateway of death. The non-believers know only the profit and loss of this world. That is why sacrificing their lives for the cause of the Hereafter appears to them as self-destruction. But they ought to know that the believers’ ‘dead’ have a far better ‘life’ than those among the non-believers who are alive: in the Hereafter, they rejoice in the bliss they have attained through sacrifice for the cause of God. Satan’s way is to take in hand those people whom he finds closer to him, and prevent them from advancing towards religion, by showing them the ‘dreadful’ consequences of such a step. People who give in to Satan’s influences thus become his agents. They exaggerate the power and the resources of the opponents of Islam in order to awe the believers. But such kinds of propaganda only serve to benefit the believers. Their conviction is strengthened all the more that their God will not abandon them in a difficult situation.",
