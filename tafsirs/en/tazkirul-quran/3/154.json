  "text": "The most important thing for the believer, in life’s trials and tribulations, is to remain calm and composed, so that he may draw up his plans with full concentration. Such composure and concentration derive from complete trust placed in God. Even on the most earth-shaking of occasions, when people find it impossible to sleep, the believers are able to revitalize themselves with the soothing effect of sleep. This was demonstrated on the occasion of Uhud when, despite the severest of conditions, they were able to have a good night’s sleep. Rested and refreshed, they then pursued the enemy forces as far as Hamraul-Asad, some eight miles from Madinah. Severely wounded and defeated, they would not have been able to take any further action, had calm not descended upon them. This hot pursuit awed the enemy, who turned about and retreated to Makkah. This is the state in which the believers live, whereas those who have not made God their guardian and protector in the full sense of these words, inevitably fear for their own lives. Bereft of any concern for religion, they are engrossed in their own selves. Such people are never blessed with composure through divine succour.",
