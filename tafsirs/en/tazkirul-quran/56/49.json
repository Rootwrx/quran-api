  "text": "The birth of a human being from the womb of his mother, the growing of crops from the earth, the falling of rain, the availability of fire from fuelâ€”all these things come directly from God. They should be treated as gifts of God and not as the results of human effort. Man should be grateful to God for all the blessings He has showered upon him.",
