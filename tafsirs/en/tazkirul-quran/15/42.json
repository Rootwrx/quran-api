  "text": "According to Mujahid, Hassan and Qatada, the meaning of ‘straight path’ is reported to be the ‘way of Truth’, which leads towards God and ends there. (Tafsir ibn Kathir). If a man adopts the path of polytheism, that path will not let him reach God but will lead towards the supposed partners of God. If he adopts the way of arrogance, his goal will be his own self. If he leads an unrestricted life, he will wander aimlessly hither and thither; his journey never leading to God. But if a man makes God his entire centre of attention and, considering Him everything, lives his life focused on God, it is quite natural that his journey should carry him towards God and that finally he should reach God. God is All-Powerful and man is totally powerless. So there can be only one true relationship between God and His subject and that is one of man’s subordination. Adopting the way of subordination to God is the means of establishing a perfect relationship with God, and Satan has no power over one who has done so. One who does not do so develops a relationship with Satan. Then he follows the suggestions of Satan, to such an extent that he reaches that very place where Satan is finally destined to arrive. Hell, which is the final destination of Satan and his companions, consists of seven stages. Ikrama says seven gates means seven stages. (Tafsir ibn Kathir). People consigned to Hell will be divided into seven big groups according to their different deeds and, on that basis, they will find a place in one of the seven sections of hell.",
