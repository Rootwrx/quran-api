  "text": "Abraham (Ibrahim) was of the same religion as Noah. All the Prophets were sent so that man can be made aware about the creation plan of God and be given the aim of purifying himself during his pre-death period. God created man and sent him into the world with a righteous nature. He must pass the test of resisting the inducements of this world and go before God having kept himself free of all the base desires of self and satanic defilement. Such souls will be welcomed into Paradise. To ascribe partners to God (shirk) amounts to belittling God. In this case, man does not discover God as the greatest Being and that is why he is lost in other so-called forms of greatness and stoops to worshipping them.",
