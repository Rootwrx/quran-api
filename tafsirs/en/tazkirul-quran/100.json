      "text": "The horse is a very loyal animal. He sacrifices himself to the utmost for the sake of his master. Even in the battlefield, he does not leave his side. This is an example which shows how a man should conduct himself. Man should also be loyal to his Lord just as the horse is loyal to man. But, in practice, it is not like that. In this world, the animal is grateful to his master, but man is not grateful to his Lord. Here an animal knows his obligations towards his master, but man does not know his obligations towards his Lord. Here an animal is totally obedient to his master, but man is not totally obedient to his Lord. Man appreciates any animal which is loyal to him. Then, how is it possible that he does not comprehend that in the eyes of God only that individual is worthy of appreciation who is loyal to Him? It is the love of wealth which blinds him. He is unable to learn the truth even from his own experiences."
