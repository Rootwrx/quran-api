  "text": "The Hudaybiyyah journey was undertaken as a result of a dream the Prophet Muhammad had. In his dream in Madinah, he had reached Makkah and was performing ‘umrah. People took this dream as a good tiding and left Madinah for Makkah. But the Quraysh obstructed their path at Hudaybiyyah and ultimately he had to return without performing ‘umrah. For this reason certain people thought that the Prophet’s dream had not been true. But this surmise proved incorrect, because the dream did not specify that ‘umrah would take place the same year, and according to the terms of the treaty itself, ‘umrah was performed peacefully and properly the very next year in Dhu’l-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of hijrah. That year the postponement of ‘umrah was agreed upon in the interests of something of greater importance, i.e. it facilitated the drawing up of a ten-year no-war pact with the Quraysh. When this was executed, it resulted in a proper atmosphere being created for dawah work. This in itself was a victory, because as a consequence, the door was opened for a final and total victory over the flag-bearers of polytheism.",
