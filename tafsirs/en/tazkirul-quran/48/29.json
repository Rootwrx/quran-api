  "text": "The Prophet Muhammad had to perform a historic role which is referred to in the Quran as making religion predominant. For this he needed a group of men of high calibre. Such men were available to him thanks to Ishmael, their progenitor, having been settled  in the Arabian desert two thousand five hundred  years before. With such ancestry it was the most vibrant group of history. When their full potential was tapped, thanks to Quranic instruction, the Arabs turned into a nation of heroes. The importance of this group was so great in the eyes of God that He informed the prophets about them in advance. In the Torah their individual qualities were mentioned while, in the Bible, their collective qualities were emphasized. The quality of the individuals in this group was made manifest in their unyielding behaviour towards the aggressors. Their behaviour was governed by principles and not by their desires or emotions. Their temperament was such that they bowed down before God and were engrossed in prayers to and praise of God.",
