  "text": "During the Hudaybiyyah journey, on one occasion, a rumour started circulating that the Quraysh had killed ‘Uthman, who had gone to them as an envoy of the Prophet. This was an aggressive step. So, the Prophet sat under an acacia tree and took a pledge from the fourteen hundred companions that they would lay down their lives, but would not show their backs to the enemy. In the history of Islam, this pledge is known as the Pledge of Ridhwan. The place at which this pledge was taken was two hundred and fifty miles from Madinah and only twelve miles from Makkah, i.e. the Muslims were far away from the centre of their activities, while the Quraysh were very near home. The Muslims had set forth with the intention of performing the minor pilgrimage (‘umrah) as such they had only the basic equipments with them, while the Quraysh were well equipped for warfare. In such critical circumstances, it was the people’s emotions of sincerity which prompted them to support the Prophet, in the absence of any external pressure.",
