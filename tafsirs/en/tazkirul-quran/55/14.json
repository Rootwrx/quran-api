  "text": "A large part of this universe is filled with stars which consist entirely of fire. Jinn are also made of this fire. But human beings have been given special treatment by God in that they have been made of earth, or clay, which is an extremely rare thing in this extensive universe. In the whole universe the earth is a unique exception. Here, all the factors that are conducive to the existence, survival and cultural development of man have been provided in the most appropriate proportions and in the most balanced manner. One of these arrangements is the system of ‘two easts’ and ‘two wests’ on the earth. In winter, the places on the horizon where the sun rises and sets are different from those in summer. In this way, there is a range of ‘easts’ and ‘wests.’ This seasonal difference occurs due to the axial tilt of the earth in space. This tilt is a most unique feature, and man receives many natural advantages on account of this. The exceptional treatment of man and the earth in this universe is such a great manifestation of God’s grace and bounty that man is in no way capable of thanking his Creator sufficiently.",
