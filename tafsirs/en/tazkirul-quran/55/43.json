  "text": "Denial and arrogance are always caused by an absence of the fear of God. When the terrible moment of Doomsday arrives, the guilty will shed their arrogance. The Truth which they were not ready to accept, in spite of the strong arguments in its favour in the present world, will be accepted by them on Doomsday without dispute. But, acceptance at that time will be of no avail. Acceptance of Godâ€™s powers is valid only at the unseen stage and not after their open manifestation.",
