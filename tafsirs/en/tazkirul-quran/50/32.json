  "text": "Who are entitled to the eternal Paradise of God? They are the people who, in this world, went in constant fear of Godâ€™s punishment. Those who were afraid before they actually came face to face with their Maker will be the ones who will be safe from fear and grief on that Day, whereas others who knew no fear will be terror-struck. Fear of God creates heavenly attributes in man, while a lack of fear creates the attributes of Hell.",
