  "text": "No day is fixed for Doomsday. Quite without warning, at the command of Almighty God, the angel Israâ€™fil will herald its commencement by blowing a trumpet (sur). Those who are unmindful of God mistakenly imagine Doomsday to be something remote. But a true believer lives in the expectation that at any time the trumpet may be blown and Doomsday will arrive. After the blowing of the trumpet, the shape of heaven and earth will undergo a drastic change and all human beings will be assembled in a new world in order to receive eternal awards, such as befit their respective deeds.",
