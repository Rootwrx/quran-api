In this world wood is always wood and anything which has the appearance of being iron or stone will be iron or stone in actual experience. Man should also be like this. There should be consistency in a manâ€™s sayings and doings, even if he is required to pay the price of facing all sorts of difficulties and has to become exceptionally patient.",
