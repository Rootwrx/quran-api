  "text": "Moses came among the Children of Israelâ€”at that time a people on the decline. They had no desire left to match their actions to their words. Their abasement was such that, on the one hand, they used to profess Faith before Moses while, on the other hand, they used to commit every sort of breach of trust and stooped to disobedience. They even used to make false allegations against Moses in order to justify the bad treatment they meted out to him. The relevant details have been set forth in the second chapter of the Bible, Exodus. After making a pledge, man, by breaking it is taken even further away from the Truth  than before.",
