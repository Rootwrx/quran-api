  "text": "It seems that on that night there is an abundance of angels on the earth. Those who are spiritually aroused are influenced by this atmosphere and, as a result, they become imbued with a spirituality which enhances the value of their religious deeds at that time as compared to such deeds as are performed in ordinary circumstances. For this reason, as the month draws towards the last ten days, the worshippers give more time to prayers, give more in charity and read as much as possible from the Quran, beseeching their Lord for His mercy and forgiveness. When the Prophet was asked by his wife, ‘A’ishah, what one’s prayer should be if one finds the Night of Destiny, Lailatul Qadr, he taught her this simple prayer: Allahumma innaka afuwwun, tuhibbul afuwa, fa afuanni. O Allah, You are forgiving, You love forgiveness, so forgive me.",
