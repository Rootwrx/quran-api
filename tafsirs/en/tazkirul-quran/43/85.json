  "text": "Heaven and earth are continuously at work in perfect harmony. Perfect unity of wisdom and unity of knowledge are found in them. This proves that there is only one God Who is alone running the systems of both heaven and earth. The universe introduces us to God’s unlimited power and at the same time His unlimited mercy. These facts call for man to fear God most of all, and at the same time, entertain the greatest hopes of Him. Those who prove to have this consciousness and this character in this world are the only individuals upon whom—when they reach God—He will shower His infinite Mercy.",
