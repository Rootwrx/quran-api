  "text": "With the advent of the explosion of Doomsday, all hidden realities will reveal themselves to the people. At that time, man will be compelled to accept God and  act only at His behest, but acceptance at that time will have no value. Only that acceptance is real acceptance which takes place at the stage of the Almighty still being unseen. True faith lies in accepting, without seeing, that which one is compelled to accept after seeing. One who accepts after seeing has, as it were, not accepted at all.",
