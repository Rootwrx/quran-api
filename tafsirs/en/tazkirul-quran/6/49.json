  "text": "The preacher of Godâ€™s word appears in the world not only as one who gives good news, but also as a warner. In other words, the basis on which a man is tested before God is that he should recognise the Truth conveyed in the language of admonition and reform himself accordingly. If he fails to recognise the Truth and demands magic feats and charms as a condition for acceptance, he merely proves his moral blindness; and for such blind people, there is no fate but havoc and destruction in this world of God.",
