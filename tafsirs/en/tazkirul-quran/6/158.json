  "text": "With the advent of the explosion of Doomsday, all hidden realities will reveal themselves to the people. At that time, man will be compelled to accept God and  act only at His behest, but acceptance at that time will have no value. Only that acceptance is real acceptance which takes place at the stage of the Almighty still being unseen. True faith lies in accepting, without seeing, that which one is compelled to accept after seeing. One who accepts after seeing has, as it were, not accepted at all. If those enjoying the power to choose today make themselves subject to Godâ€™s will, they will be rewarded by God with Paradise. But, if they bow down before God only after the arrival of Doomsday, their bowing down will amount to proving their guilt with more force. This will mean that, by their own admission, they did not accept something which was really worth accepting; they did not perform such tasks as were really worth performing.",
