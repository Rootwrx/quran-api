  "text": "The unadulterated missionary call for Truth always stands out as something rather strange. On the one hand, there is the customary religion which enjoys prominence in all social institutions. Centuries of traditions are behind it to lend it weight. On the other hand, there is the call for Truth, which has no time-honoured conventions in its favour. It is difficult, therefore, for people to understand that customary religion, which has such an elevated status and great popularity, will not be to God’s liking. The common presumption is that it has been possible for the customary religion to flourish to this extent because it suited God’s will and pleasure: had it not been so, it would not have spread and endured to this extent. They raise the question of whether God’s favoured religion will be one already enjoying a high status everywhere in this world of God or one which has no standing whatsoever.",
