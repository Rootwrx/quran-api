  "text": "The universe is of infinite immensity. So, its Creator and Lord must also be one who is of unlimited greatness: this mighty being cannot be anyone except the one and only God. Nobody can seriously venture to assume anybody except God to be the Creator and Lord of the universe. So, if the Creator and Lord of the universe is one and only one being, then it follows essentially that all praises should also be due to Him; man should devote his full attention to Him; he should make Him his all.",
