  "text": "Having one’s deeds ‘written down’ does not mean having them written with pen and ink in the usual sense; it means rather having one’s deeds recorded. Man’s motives, his utterances and his deeds are all being recorded with precision in accordance with God’s arrangements. This record will be so supremely real that it will not be possible for anybody to deny its correctness.",
