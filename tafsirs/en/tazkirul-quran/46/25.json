  "text": "The people of Ad mistook the clouds of destruction for rain clouds. They understood the reality only when the raging winds entered their townships and reduced them to ruins. Man is so reckless that he does not accept the Truth even when on the brink of disaster. He accepts it only after the opportunity to repent has been taken away from him.",
