  "text": "Children who are obedient to their parents are also obedient to God. Contrary to this, the behaviour of disobedient children is such that, when they grow up, they forget that their parents had to endure innumerable troubles to bring them to adulthood. The best well-wishers of the individual are his parents. Whatever advice parents offer their children is based on absolutely selfless well-wishing. Therefore, one should give more weight to the advice of righteous parents. One who rebukes his righteous parents for their advice proves by his behaviour that he is a very hard-hearted person. It is such as he who will suffer heavy losses.",
