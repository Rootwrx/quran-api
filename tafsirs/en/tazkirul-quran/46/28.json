  "text": "The worldly status enjoyed by the Quraysh chiefs had made them arrogant. Here they have been reminded of their neighbours, the people of ‘Ad. From the point of view of civilization, they had been on a much higher plane than the Quraysh. Nonetheless, when God’s ordinance was imposed, their entire grandeur and glory were destroyed. Whatever they had considered their supports, failed to come to their rescue. A human being is, after all, going to be greatly reduced in stature before the majesty of God. But that apart, the system of the world has been devised in such a way that in this life man has to make himself small before others. This is shown by events which are the signs of God. If, before being cut down to size in the Hereafter, a man learns a lesson from these signs, he will voluntarily make himself small in this very life. Before facing the Hereafter, he will become realistic in this world itself. Different kinds of events demonstrate God’s signs, but man turns a blind eye and a deaf ear to them, for he is not prepared to learn any lesson from them.",
