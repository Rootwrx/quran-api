  "text": "In these verses a scene from Hell is depicted. Those who had assumed great positions in this world will forget their so-called greatness in the hereafter. Now, the common people, who were so proud of their heroes, will express their displeasure with them. Those who were not prepared to accept the Truth in this world will now humbly bow down before it. But this submissiveness in the Hereafter will be of no avail to any one.",
