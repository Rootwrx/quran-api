  "text": "The phenomena of rains soaking dry land and thereafter greenery sprouting from it are a regular occurence. This is an allegorical reference to an inner reality. In this way man is informed that God has made extensive and elaborate arrangements in this world to refresh and invigorate his dry existence. The soil absorbs the water and allows it to percolate downwards, making the rain water a source of revitalization for it. Similarly, if man allows God’s guidance to permeate his existence, he too will become reanimated upon receiving it. The main reason for a man’s not benefitting from God’s guidance is that he distorts God’s message. When God’s guidance comes to him, he does not take it as it is, instead he tries to ferret out some points in it which he may misrepresent. In this way, God’s guidance does not become a part of his mind.  It does not nourish his soul. For those who accept God’s guidance as it is, there is the reward of paradise, and for those who distort its real meaning, there is the punishment of hell.",
