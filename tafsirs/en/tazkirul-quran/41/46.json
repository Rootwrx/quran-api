  "text": "When the Truth was revealed through previous prophets, some people accepted it while others did not. The same thing happened when the last of the prophets was raised. Why does man give the Truth such indifferent treatment? The reason for this is the existence of the present conditions for man’s trial. In the present world of trial, whenever Truth appears, a veil is attached to it which screens it from human vision. This veil, which was required to be torn asunder, is then turned into a source of doubt. But this doubt cannot be an excuse for anybody on the Day of Judgement, because it proves that man was not serious about the issue of Truth. Man is perfectly serious in the matter of his worldly interests and therefore he tears down all the veils and discovers the reality. Similarly, if he were to become serious about his ‘other-worldly’ interests, he would pull down all the veils of doubt and see reality as it actually is.",
