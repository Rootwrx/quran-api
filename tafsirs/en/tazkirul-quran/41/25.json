  "text": "In the present world, on the one hand, there are preachers of God who advise or instruct a man about the Truth. On the other hand, there are leaders who exploit people by making such speeches as please them. Those who pay no heed to God’s advice fall a prey to leaders’ smooth talks and without stopping to think, rush headlong to perdition. Those who are deceived by the false utterances of such leaders and rush after them cannot but end by being destroyed forever.",
