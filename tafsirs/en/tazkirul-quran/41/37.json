  "text": "The greatest human blunder is having regard for outward appearances. In ancient times, the sun, the moon and stars appeared quite dazzling to man, so he took them as deities and started worshipping them. In the present age, it is the glamour of the material side of civilization which appears dazzling. So, materialism has now been given the same status as was enjoyed in former times by the sun and the moon, though the sun, the moon and other phenomena are all creations of God. A man should worship the Creator and not His creations. The arrogance of the proud is not related to the call of Truth but to the preacher giving that call.  It appears to the leaders of an age that the preacher of Truth is smaller in stature than themselves and that therefore  the message conveyed by him is also of lesser import.",
