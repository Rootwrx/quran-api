  "text": "The moment of crisis for a man is the moment of self-discovery. So, when he is confronted with adversity, he forgets  self-conceit and starts remembering God. At that time, he realises that he is the subject or servant of God and God is his Deity. But, when God gives him relief from his trouble and blesses him with amenities, he immediately forgets his earlier position. He links the grace of God bestowed upon him with the cause-and-effect chain and considers it to be result of his own devices and abilities. He develops a perverse mentality according to which he thinks that the only life is that of this world, and that there will be no reckoning in the Court of God. Furthermore, his prosperity leads him into the misunderstanding that since he is well-off here, he will definitely be well-off in the hereafter also.",
