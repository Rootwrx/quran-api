  "text": "A study of the universe reveals that its creation has been effected gradually in a phased manner. Creation in this wayâ€”in other words by stages, means planned creation; and when the creation of the universe has been so carried out, it essentially follows that it has a Planner who has purposefully created it according to a set plan. Similarly, there are mountains on this earth at various places that maintain the balance of the earth. There are millions of species of living organisms on this earth and every species requires different types of sustenance, which are  found in its habitat. Similarly, a study of the universe also shows that initially all things were in the shape  of divided atoms. Then they combined to form different entities. It is further evident from such a study that all the things in this immense universe are uniformly governed by the laws of nature. These observations clearly establish that the Creator of the universe is all-knowing and all-aware.  He is all-powerful and dominant.  So, who else can be there whom a man can treat as being worthy of worship?",
