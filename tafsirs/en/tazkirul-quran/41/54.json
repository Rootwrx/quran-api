  "text": "The story of all the people inhabiting this world is the story of the present.  No story is the story of the future, because nobody’s future could ratify its present. In such a world it was forecast by the Quran about itself one thousand five hundred years ago that the events and facts occurring after its advent would go on testifying to the correctness of the Quran.  In the ensuing ages, the Quran will not only maintain its veracity, but will become clearer and more rationally established. The Quran will always be ‘the book of the hour’. All these forecasts in respect of the Quran have proved, quite wonderfully, to be one hundred per cent correct. Academic research, historical events and revolutions throughout the ages, have all built up evidence in favour of the Quran, so much so that even non-Muslim research has borne testimony to the fact that, in view of its rare qualities, the Quran itself provides the proof of its being a Book of God. No human writing can possess such eternal qualities. Those who do not bow down before the veracity of the Quran, in spite of this clear reality, simply prove that their audacity has made them lacking in seriousness; it is only frivolous people who can indulge in the unreasonable behaviour of not accepting reality, in spite of clear evidence in support of it.",
