  "text": "If God’s bounties are bestowed on anyone, he should  take it as God’s Grace and be grateful to Him. But it is man’s wont to become arrogant on receiving favours. When he gets into trouble, however, he starts pleading with God to help him.  But invocations made under compulsion have no value in the eyes of God. Man would be truly virtuous only if he bowed down before God in times of comfort as well as in times of trouble. The Truth does not compel anybody: submission to it should be voluntary.   So, those who do not have any compulsion to make this obeisance ignore the Truth, for in material terms, they see no harm likely to befall them for doing so.",
