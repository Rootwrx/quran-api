  "text": "It has been recorded in the Hadith that the Angel Israfil is looking towards the throne (â€˜arsh) of God with the trumpet (sur) in his mouth awaiting His orders and ready to blow the trumpet instantly. The blowing of the trumpet will be just like the ringing of a bell which signals the end of the examination. Immediately thereafter, the system of the world will change: the stage of the appearance of results will commence, while at present we are still at the stage of actions.",
