  "text": "Modern research has established that whatever a man utters remains preserved in the atmosphere in the form of vibrations or waves. Similarly, the image of the actions which a man performs remains preserved in the form of light waves. In other words, every individual in this world is being constantly video-recorded. It should be borne in mind that in this world, without a manâ€™s knowledge and quite independent of his will, his utterances and actions, being completely recorded and preserved, could be replayed any time later.",
