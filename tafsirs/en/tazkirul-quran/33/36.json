  "text": "Man has been created independent, but he has to surrender his independence to God. This is the real test of man in this world. One who passes this crucial test is the one who is on the right path. An example of this is the marriage in the early period of Zayd and Zaynab. Zayd was a freed slave, unlike Zaynab, who belonged to a highly placed family of the Quraysh, being the daughter of Aminah, daughter of Abdul Muttalib. The Prophet Muhammad wanted Zayd to marry Zaynab but Zaynab’s people were not ready for this. Zaynab herself said, ‘I am of higher birth than he.’ But, when the Quran’s aforesaid verse was recited to them, they showed their willingness immediately. In the year 4 AH the marriage took place. This is the Islamic temperament and this should be the temperament of every Muslim male and every Muslim female.",
