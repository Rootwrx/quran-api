  "text": "The Prophet Muhammad was sent into this world to convey the divine religion to man. The subject of God who undertakes such a divine mission receives the full support of God and his angels. To favour him is as good as favouring God and His angels, and to evade him amounts to evading God and His angels. Those who harassed the Prophet Muhammad were, to their way of thinking, making life difficult for a mere man, but they forgot that they were actually dealing with a representative of God. And those who harass Godâ€™s representatives have always rendered themselves accursed in the eyes of the Lord of the Universe.",
