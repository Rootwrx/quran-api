  "text": "When an adulterated religion is dominant, the adoption of true religion is always the most difficult task. Under such circumstances, the hearts of the faithful sometimes harbour feelings of dejection and disappointment. There is one certain method of saving oneself from this and that is to keep looking for the silver lining in the dark clouds. Common people live on the strength of materialism, while the Faithful live on the strength of ideas. To live on the level of ideas means that a man lives for the remembrance of God. The angelsâ€™ inaudible discourse should be audible to him. He should give the utmost importance to his intellectual and spiritual development.",
