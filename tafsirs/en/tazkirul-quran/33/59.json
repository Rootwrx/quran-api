  "text": "When a Muslim woman leaves her house on an errand, she should be so clad as to give the impression that she is a well-bred, respectable, modest woman, and that she has left her home for some serious need and not to make merry or to go in search of entertainment. Simple apparel, a modest gait, the body properly covered, etc.â€”these are the symbols of that approach.",
