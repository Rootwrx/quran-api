  "text": "Here, addressing the Prophetâ€™s consorts about correct behaviour, instruction is indirectly given to Muslim women as to how they should conduct themselves. Unlike worldly women, it should not be their aim to show off their charms and finery. Their attention should be entirely directed towards the worship of God. They should spend their wealth for the cause of God and their time in understanding the teachings of Islam. This style of life makes one pure and righteous and it is only the pure and righteous who are approved of by Almighty God.",
