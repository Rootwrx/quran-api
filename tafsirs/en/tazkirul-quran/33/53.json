  "text": "Here, the Prophet Muhammad’s instructions have been given to Muslims as to what their domestic and social behaviour should be; that whenever they enter anybody else’s house, they should do so with permission; when they are invited by somebody to partake of food, etc., they should remain in the house only as long as necessary, and leave soon afterwords. If they visit somebody, they should desist from unnecessary talks; in case they have any work in connection with women, they should do it with a curtain in between, etc. In social life, a man should not simply concern himself with his own interests, needs and desires, but should very seriously ensure that his actions do not give trouble to others. Pointless chatter should not result in wastage of others’ time.",
