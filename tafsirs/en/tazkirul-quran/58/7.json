  "text": "The universe with its complex system bears testimony to the fact that it is under the careful watch of a Higher Power. The evidence of this vigilance over the universe proves that man is also constantly under the eyes of his Creator. In view of this, indulging in secret activities against Truth is the act of blind people who are unable to read the attributes of God either in the expressly worded Quran directly, or in the unworded message of the universe indirectly. When certain hypocrites used to approach the Prophet Muhammad, instead of saying assalamu alaykum (peace be on you)  they used to say assamu alaykum (death be upon you). This has always been the way of superficial persons. Such people derive pleasure from showing disrespect to true believers. They forget that at that very moment the whole of Godâ€™s creation will acclaim the truthful person, while they, with their narrow mentality, will have exhausted every  last word of contempt and rejection.",
