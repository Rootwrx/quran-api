  "text": "In reality, man is always under the eye of God. But, in the present world, man does not realize that God is watching him. In the Hereafter this veil will fall. At that time man will realize that he was completely visible to God, and to such an extent that nothing about him was hidden from Him. Those who ignore the truth do so relying on their “great men.” Whatever the common man does is done at the instance of leaders. In the Hereafter, when these people find themselves completely helpless, they will turn for assistance to their ‘great men’ on whom they had relied for guidance in this life. But the ‘great men’ will confess that their misguided leadership ended with the previous world. This being the case, how can they be expected to extend any help to them? They will tell their erstwhile followers that they are all destined to face the consequences of going astray, just as they themselves shall have to do. They will add that, whether they like it or not, they shall have to face this fate.",
