  "text": "The people of Arabia who rejected the Prophet Muhammad were those very people who had already accepted God and religion. Then why did they reject him? The reason for this was that in his case Truth was revealed in its abstract form, while they used to consider as true only that which had reached them through their ‘ancestors’. They recognized the religion of their ‘National Heroes’, but failed to recognize the religion of ‘Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah’. Those who find religion under the influence of national traditions make a display of religiosity, but are, in fact, engaged in superficial activities in the name of religion. This has nothing to do with the spirit of the religion. What God requires is real religiousness and not just performance of certain rituals. God approves of a man who has discovered the truth by means of his own mental striving; who has made observations of God in the realm of the unseen; who has recognized truth in its absolute form and supported it; whose soul has bathed in God’s sea; who is restless in God’s love and whose eyes have shed tears with the fear of God. The religiousness of the first type of people is entirely superficial and outward, and of no value in the eyes of God. On the contrary, the religion of the second type of people is the real one. This is imbedded in the innermost recesses of human existence. A study of the universe reveals that its creation is based on realities; in such a universe only good deeds have value and not suppositions and wishful thinking.",
