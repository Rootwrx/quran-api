  "text": "The Shariah has subjected man to some regulations in respect of divorce and other matters. These regulations are apparently restrictive of manâ€™s free nature. But, in reality, these are blessings. The advantage of these regulations is that man is saved from many unnecessary and avoidable harms. Furthermore, the system of this world is so framed that every harm is compensated for in some way or the other. However, such compensation is available only to individuals who do not go beyond the sphere of nature.",
