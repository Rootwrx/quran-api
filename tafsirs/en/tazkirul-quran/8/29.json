  "text": "This ability to tell right from wrong (furqan) is almost the same as inner realisation (maâ€˜rifah) or insight (basirah). The last mentioned creating an inner light in a man which enables him to see everything in its reality without his being deceived by its outward aspects. Whenever a man involves himself in anything to the point of always being careful about it, a particular sort of sensitivity develops in him which makes him recognise the favourable and unfavourable aspects of that matter. This applies to everyone, whether he be a religious man, a trader, a doctor or an engineer. If a man becomes totally devoted to his work, his inner realisation attains a degree when, without being entangled in this or that confusion, he straightway reaches the reality of the matter.Development of this divine insight (furqan) in a man is the greatest guarantee that he will be safe from evils; he will regularise his relations with God, and he finally will become entitled to the grace of God.",
