  "text": "Every man has to live with the consequences of his deeds, for better or for worse. This means that the man worthy of Paradise lives in a paradisical atmosphere, while the man fit only for Hell lives in a hellish atmosphere. Only those possessing the insight to appreciate intangible things, will be able to perceive this difference. Paradise would be the final and perfect manifestation of manâ€™s ambitions, which he wants to fulfill in this world, but cannot. The price of this Paradise is a God-fearing attitude. Those who fear God in this world will be made inhabitants of the perfect world of Paradise which would be free of any shortcomings.",
