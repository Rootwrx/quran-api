  "text": "Moses was born in Egypt. There, by some mischance, a Copt got killed by him. Thereafter, he left Egypt and went to Madyan. After he had spent many years there and was married, he decided to return to Egypt, taking along with him his wife and his flock of sheep. In the course of this journey, Moses passed through the Tur valley situated in the south of the Sinai peninsula. When night fell, he was unable to make out the way in the darkness. Moreover, it was winter time and the weather was bitterly cold. But soon he saw some far-off fire burning. Moses immediately set off in that direction to obtain some burning brands to keep them warm and also in the hopes of finding someone of whom he could ask the way.",
