  "text": "The Israelites had a sacred chest, or box, known as the Ark of the Covenant (at-tabut), which they had had in their possession from the time they left Egypt. It contained the Ten Commandments engraved on stone, as well as relics of Moses and Aaron. This was a possession sacred to Israel. It served as a visible symbol of God’s gracious presence. It guided them on their journey, and led them on from victory to victory. It was lost to the enemy in the early part of Samuel’s ministry. But in the town where this Ark was placed, plague and pestilence broke out and the Philistines were terrified. Subsequently, they placed it on a driverless cart drawn by two cows. The beasts took it of their own accord to Bayt ash-Shamsh, a city of Judah. The Israelites were immensely overjoyed at its miraculous restoration.",
