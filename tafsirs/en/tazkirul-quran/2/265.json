  "text": "If an individual has some goal in mind, his own striving towards the attainment of that goal further strengthens his will-power and increases the mental resolve which enables him to reach his objective. Should it be the objects of his own desires towards which his efforts are directed, then the more he exerts himself, the more he will set his heart on them. However, should it be the will of God that holds pride of place in determining his actions, then it will be God on whom his heart is set. One acts at all events under conditions which are sometimes difficult and sometimes comparatively easy. But the more difficult the conditions one encounters, the greater will be the increase in one’s will-power and the stronger one’s connection to that on which one’s heart is set. One who spends for the cause of God under normal conditions will certainly have his reward from God. However, when spending for God’s cause is done in adverse circumstances, which call for a special exercise of will-power, the reward which God grants on such occasions will be commensurately greater. For instance, if the outlay of one’s wealth is done on something from which no worldly benefit will be forthcoming, then in that case it is done solely for the sake of God. Then one may have to give to a person to whom one would rather not give anything. Again it is done just to please God. One may have a grudge against someone, yet one still extends to him the hand of friendship. All these acts strengthen one’s bond with the Lord, opening the way to His special grace and succour.",
