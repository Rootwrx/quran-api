  "text": "It was at the time of the construction of the Ka‘bah that Abraham and Ishmael prayed for a prophet to be born among the people of Makkah. The prayer was answered, and the coming of the final prophet, whose focus would be Makkah, was decreed. God’s messengers who came to the world used to prophesy his coming. Now that he had come, the Ka‘bah in Makkah was made the prayer direction for all nations. This was God’s sign, indicating that the prophet, whose coming had been anticipated, had finally arrived. As for the sincere—they needed no further proof, but even the conclusiveness of this sign was not enough to silence those who gave no thought to God. It is those who fear God who are guided on the path to Him. God remembers those who remember Him. Only those who are filled with fear of Him are free of fear of all else besides Him.",
