  "text": "Once an object, which is not God, is accepted as God as a result of man’s superstitious attitude, many other accompanying evils ensue. An animal may come to be regarded as possessing supernatural powers—something possessed only by God. That animal is then held to be a means of achieving proximity to God and is expected to be a source of blessings. In the next generation all these superstitious beliefs become firmly rooted in the human psyche and are upheld with great zeal and fervour as the sacred way of the forefathers. At this stage, people become resistant to any rational analysis of these superstitious beliefs. The situation deteriorates further with succeeding generations. People reach a level where they are totally unable to hear or understand any argument put forward to them. They act as if they have neither eyes nor ears to see and hear, nor brains to give thought to any argument presented to them.",
