  "text": "Religion, as revealed by God, is one religion. Yet men differ on this point, putting a variety of interpretations upon divine religion, so that it may fit in with their mental make-up. In this way different viewpoints, all claiming allegiance to one divine scripture, come into existence. When this happens, God chooses one of His servants to proclaim the truth on earth. He talks in human language, and appears no different from everyone else, but those who are bent on finding truth appreciate the divine quality in his words. Forgetting their differences, they flock to his standard. Others, however, stick stubbornly to their self-contrived interpretations of religion. Why, they contend should we accept what is taught to us by another? Their claim to have a monopoly over truth makes them proud and prejudiced. It causes them to deny truth itselfâ€”the very thing that they in their complacency claimed to monopolize.",
