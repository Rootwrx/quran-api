  "text": "However, the imposition of law alone is not a guarantee of social reforms. For a real reform it is essential that the spirit of God-fearing (taqwa) prevails in society. That is why, while giving legal commands, the Quran places faith, taqwa and the Hereafter in the foreground. Even a secular system will run successfully only when its citizens possess the necessary national character. Similarly, the Islamic system is truly brought into being when a considerable number of its members possess the spirit of taqwa. National character, or taqwa is, in fact, another name for the willingness of the individuals to uphold the desired system. If we do not find public acceptance of a system to a certain degree, it cannot be imposed by the power of law alone. Furthermore, according to Islam, what is actually most desirable is the reform of the individual. Society is not the target of reform according to Islam. The reform of society is only a by-product. The Quran calls to faith, to taqwa, to genuine concern for the Hereafter. This call is realized in the individual and not in a social system. That is why the actual addressee of the Quranic call is the individual. The reform of society is in actual fact a social manifestation of the reform of a number of individuals.",
