  "text": "Fighting during the sacred months (Muharram, Rajab, Dhu’l-Qada, Dhu’l-Hijjah) or fighting within the precincts of Makkah is forbidden. But if opponents commit aggression in these months, believers may fight back in self-defence. But while fighting, believers must abstain from all atrocities, they should not transgress any bounds set by God—if they truly fear God—even at times of great provocation as in a state of war.",
