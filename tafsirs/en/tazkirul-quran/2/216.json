  "text": "The same is true of all aspects of life. People like to lead free and unrestricted lives, but it is better for them to adhere to God’s laws. They make friends with those who praise them. But they would be better advised to become endeared to their critics—those who are kind enough to point out their faults. In order to save face in the eyes of men, they defy truth, though they would do better to seek honour with God; and God honours only those who uphold the truth. Sacrifice and struggle are things that they shy away from; they prefer a religion which promises paradise without such total involvement. But it would be better for them  to engage themselves in the sacrifice and struggle which it entails, for that will benefit them in the long run. The trouble is, they are deeply enmeshed in the present life and its issues, whereas they would be wiser paying attention to matters lying beyond death.",
