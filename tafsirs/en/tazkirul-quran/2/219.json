  "text": "The answers to the above questions reveal certain fundamental principles: firstly, if something does more harm than good, it should be eschewed: secondly, any wealth in excess of one’s actual needs should be spent for the cause of God: thirdly, in one’s dealings with others, one should avoid any action which could lead to evil, and engage only in such activity as will bring some positive benefit to society. Let us concede that after drinking wine a person becomes elated. And gambling could be looked upon as an easy way of making money without having to work hard for it. But, viewed from a purely moral angle, drinking and gambling lead to such spiritual danger as far outweighs any benefits they may confer. The same rule applies to other human activities. If they are calculated to be more harmful than beneficial, they are to be avoided. Social celebrations, political initiatives, personal enterprises, all the activities of one’s life, in fact, should be evaluated in terms of this standard, before one ever considers engaging in them.",
