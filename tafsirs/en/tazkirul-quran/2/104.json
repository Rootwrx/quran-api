  "text": "Some people would sit in the Prophet’s company and, by playing on words, make a mockery of his teachings. For instance, instead of using the unambiguous Arabic word for ‘May we have your attention’—‘unzurna’—they would say ‘ra‘ina’. ‘Ra‘ina’, when pronounced properly, has much the same meaning as ‘unzurna’, but with the protraction of the second vowel, it becomes ‘raeena’, meaning ‘our shepherd,’ and with the protraction of the first it becomes ‘raaina’, which means idiot.",
