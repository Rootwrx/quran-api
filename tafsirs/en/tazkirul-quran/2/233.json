  "text": "After divorce, many matters remain to be cleared up. Sometimes the husband and wife wish to remarry; or maybe the woman wishes to have a new husband. On no account should obstacles be placed in their path. A woman may well have children from her former husband. Maybe they are infants, who have to be suckled. This being the case, the man and the woman should not cause trouble for one another. Rather than make the matter an emotional issue between them, they should settle it by mutual counsel and consent. This is how a believer should settle matters involving conflict and separation. The interests of both parties should be respected, with neither party seeking to inconvenience the other. Attempts should be made to settle the dispute in a manner acceptable to both sides. This is the cleaner, purer way of settling disputes, a method befitting those whose souls have been purified by true belief. Unless a person believes in God and fears His judgement, he will not be inclined to heed admonishment, no matter how correct and relevant it may be. He will set out to find a loophole in the advice he has been given and make up some excuse or the other for not applying it to himself. One who believes in God and the Last Day, knows, however, that the matter does not end there. Finally it will come before God, at which point the erring individual will not be able to make any excuses for having shirked his responsibilities.",
