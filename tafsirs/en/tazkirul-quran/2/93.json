  "text": "The Jews were not ready to accept the Quran, because they thought they were already rightly guided. They were sure that the very fact that they belonged to the largest group of the followers of truth, that is, the Israelites, that would be enough to earn them salvation. But, in fact, this was a feeling of ethnic superiority which they mistook for love of truth. The communal values of their group came to occupy the position of pure truth. That was why, when the truth appeared in its original form, they failed to accept it. Had their aim been to find pure truth, they would not have found it difficult, since predictions about it had appeared in their own sacred book, (the Torah) to the effect that now it was the Quran that was the Book of Truth to be followed and not the religion of their own group.",
