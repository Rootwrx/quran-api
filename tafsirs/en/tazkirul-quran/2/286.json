  "text": "Who is that man who measures up to the standards of the Almighty? He is one who is a man of faith, who submits and obeys. Faith means a conscious surrender to God, while obedience means practical surrender. For this to become a reality, man must enshrine God within himself as his Creator and Sustainer. He must be one to discover the reality that the system of the universe is not soulless or mechanical. Rather it is a live system, which is run by Godâ€™s devoted workers. He must be one to recognize those servants of God chosen by Him to communicate this message to mankind. The Book revealed by God for the guidance of mankind must be accepted by him and become a part of his thoughts in the real sense. When faith in God, His angels, His Books and His messengers is firmly rooted in his heart and mind, he wholeheartedly surrenders himself to treading the path shown by God. This faith and obedience should not be a matter of rituals or just an outward show. Rather, faith and obedience should be so inseparable from his soul that he starts to remember God at all times, and his whole life becomes entirely dependent on God.",
