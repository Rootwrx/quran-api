  "text": "Truth, supported by clear proofs, is revealed to men, yet still they refuse to accept it. Why is this? It is because they see truth as destructive to the dream world they have built up; they view it as damaging to their own interests and honour, as threatening to the comfortable, secure lives to which they have become accustomed. But in order to be faithful to God, we are required to make sacrifices of this nature. It is the road that men are reluctant to tread, because of its dangers and difficulties. But that is the only road which leads to Paradise. The price of Paradise is one’s own self. There is only one way to earn Paradise, and that is by total self-abnegation. This involves changing the very foundation of one’s life, thinking and acting in accordance with the pattern God has laid down, and giving up former habits. This task cannot be performed without exhorting others to do good deeds, and criticising their misdeeds. People in every age have been especially averse to criticism and admonition of this nature. Teachers of truth, then, have to be prepared for adverse reactions from their congregations.",
