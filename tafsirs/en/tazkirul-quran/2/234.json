  "text": "While explaining the laws of marriage and divorce the Quran repeatedly enjoins going in fear of God and being kind to others. This shows that to carry out any command in its true spirit, individuals are required to go beyond the wording of that command, in its purely legal sense. Rather they must have feelings of goodwill, well-wishing, kindness and justice for one another. At the same time they must always go in fear of God: if they do not behave properly with their fellow men, they will incur Godâ€™s displeasure. On Judgement Day neither will excuses come to their rescue, nor will they be able to hide anything from God.",
