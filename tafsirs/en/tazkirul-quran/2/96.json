  "text": "The fact that the Israelites were not really concerned with truth is proved by their own history. It was they who had slain their own prophets, such as Zachariah and John the Baptist, the only reason for these actions being that these prophets had criticized the Israelites’ mode of living, and sought to bring them back to the divine way (Nehemiah,\n9:26\n). They had seen Moses perform undeniable miracles, but when he was not with them in person, having left them to spend forty days on Mount Sinai, they started worshipping the golden calf; it had only been his personal authority which had kept them under control. When the Mount was raised threateningly above their heads, they temporarily agreed to do ‘all that the Lord hath spoken’ (Exodus,\n19:5\n, 8,\n16\n, 18), but, after that, most of them returned to their disobedient ways. If they had really been seeking God, their attention would have been entirely focused on the life after death; but, in fact, they, more than all the others, were obsessed with the love of the present world.",
