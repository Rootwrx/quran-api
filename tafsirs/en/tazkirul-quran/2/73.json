  "text": "A murder was committed among the Israelites in Moses’ time. The method that God revealed to His prophet to identify the killer was that an animal should be sacrificed, and the dead man’s corpse be struck with a piece of it. The dead man would then name the murderer. The third lesson in this instance was that life after death is no less a reality than life before death. Just as the dead corpse was revived, so every soul will be raised up in the Hereafter and given new life.",
