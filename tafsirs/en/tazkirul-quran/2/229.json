  "text": "Divorce is an abnormal event which takes place in an abnormal situation. But, in this most emotional matter too, the Quran commands us to adhere to going in fear of God (taqwa), and to being both just and kind. From this we may gauge what kind of behaviour God desires from a believer in this life. We are commanded to break the marriage bond, if this has become unavoidable, in three stages and not all at once.",
