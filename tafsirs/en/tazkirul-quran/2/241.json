  "text": "Setting forth injunctions regarding social matters, the Quran states, ‘This is an obligation binding on the righteous.’ This shows us an important aspect of Islamic law. In mutual matters there are certain rights on which the law has been laid down. But there are further mutual rights which go beyond fixed boundaries. These rights can be seen as such only by those who are God-fearing. The more one is God-fearing, the more sensitive one is in discharging one’s duties with regard to giving others their dues.",
