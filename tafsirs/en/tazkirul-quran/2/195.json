  "text": "More than anything else, the struggle for the cause of God demands the expenditure of money. It is the sacrifice of wealth, which man finds most difficult. That is why the Quran enjoins us to regard the cause of God as our own cause and to spend generously for the cause of religion. If we fail to do so, we are inviting our own destruction in this world as well as in the next. If man does not surrender all that he has to God, why should God give what He has to him? Man thinks that the best use of his wealth is to spend it on himself or his family. But the Quran calls this the way to destruction. The proper use of wealth is to spend generously for the cause of religion. This will make man deserving of Godâ€™s blessings. He will receive divine succour in this world and will be rewarded with paradise in the hereafter.",
