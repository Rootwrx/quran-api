  "text": "A mosque in an inhabited locality has the same importance as the heart in the human body. The heart of a human being is illuminated by faith, while mosques are illuminated by prayers. Mosques are constructed so that within their sacred precincts, devotees may concentrate their thoughts on God and spend some time in offering prayers to Him. In the spiritual atmosphere prevailing therein, they turn quite naturally towards their Maker. A human being, on whom God bestows the gift of divine guidance, learns to recognize the call of truth. His heart is filled with feelings of awe towards God and he decides to lead a God-oriented life. It is people such as these who become self-effacing and self-sacrificing God-worshippers. They are the ones who will receive the unlimited blessings of God.",
