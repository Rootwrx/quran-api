  "text": "Events of the physical world give direct introduction of the Creator, but only to those who possess insight. Rain for example, results after a series of events that comprise the rain cycle. The lightning and thunder, and the succession of day and night are likewise miraculous phenomena. On seeing such occurences an insightful man mentally journeys to reach beyond external appearances to grasp the higher, innate reality of things. This is called ‘ibrah, meaning ‘to traverse’.",
