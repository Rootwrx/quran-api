  "text": "In stark contrast to the person who revives his inner natural urge and consequently is blessed with the wealth of faith, there exists the other type whose ‘oil’ does not become ignited by the fire of Truth. Of the second type, are those who follow a concocted religion. They build a palace of false hopes and are happy in it. Thus they live with their misconceptions till they are overtaken by death, which suddenly dispels the magical spell of their misconceptions. They then realise that what they thought of as their goal until now, was nothing but a pit of destruction. Another category consists of open rebels and rejecters of Truth. Disregarding God’s guidance, they become utter failures and grope in the dark forever.",
