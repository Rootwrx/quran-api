  "text": "Before the advent of Islam, Arab society enjoyed total freedom. Thereafter, however, Islam imposed some restrictions on entry into houses, as mentioned above. People thereupon felt that because of these restrictions, their social lives would become very constrained. These verses were then revealed to clarify matters. It was made clear that the restrictions were meant to regulate and systematize social life and not to curtail legitimate freedom. For instance, if the blind, the lame and the sick were isolated from attendants, relatives, etc., it would amount to making them physically helpless. But this was never the intention of Islam. So, leeway has been made in the earlier provisions and their true spirit has been indicated. It is stated that Islam’s real purpose is that people should be each other’s true well-wishers. When a man enters another’s house, he should make a salutation, saying: ‘Peace be on you and His (God’s) blessings be showered on you.’ If people are imbued with this spirit, most social evils will automatically cease.",
