  "text": "A man is not bad simply because evil is spoken of him. Conversely, no one becomes good simply by popular acclaim. Critical comments genuinely apply to an individual only if they are in accordance with his nature. If evil people pass evil comments about good people, then such comments turn back upon the speakers themselves and good people are completely absolved of any blame. Nevertheless, those who are personally good may become objects of calumny. It is certain, however, that in the Hereafter they will be considered innocent and no blame will attach to them. Rather, they will be showered with rewards, because they had to face false allegations on account of their breaking off with untruth and their complete attachment to the Truth.",
