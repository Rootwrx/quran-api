  "text": "The Quran is a book of guidance. But in order to have the benefit of it, it is necessary for the reader to be serious about it. If some improper feeling makes him flippant about it, he can never avail of the counsel offered, even although it has been presented in the best possible manner. If any commandment of religion is issued by which an individual is required to sacrifice his desires and interests, Satan immediately gives him some excuse not to do so, and since the present world is a trial ground for mankind, he has the opportunity to make use of this lame excuse. But this holds only for a very short time. When death strikes, the whole position will be entirely different.",
