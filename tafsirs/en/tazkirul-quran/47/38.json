  "text": "The benefits of the world and its attractiveness act as impediments to the adoption of a life of Faith and righteousness. Man knows what kind of behaviour will lead him to success in the Hereafter. But immediate considerations overcome him and he goes astray. The fact is that God is most Merciful and Kind towards his subjects. He never demands of His subjects anything which is unbearable to them. Islam is Godâ€™s religion. But the tasks of its propagation and protection have to be carried out in this world of cause and effect by a group of human beings. Muslims constitute this group. If Muslims discharge their duty, they will demonstrate their worthiness in the eyes of God. But if they fail to discharge this duty, God will guide other nations towards the Faith and maintain the continuity of His religion through them.",
