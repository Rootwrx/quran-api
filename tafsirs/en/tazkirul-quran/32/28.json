  "text": "In ancient Makkah the polytheists were dominant, while Islam was in a very  weak position, so much so that the polytheists used to ridicule Islam and Muslims. In response to this, Almighty God has given an example: He asks people to consider a land which is dry and barren. To all appearances, it seems impossible that it will ever become covered with greenery. But, God causes the clouds to pour rain-water on it. In a few days time, the dry land is replaced with lush green fields. Similarly, Godâ€™s powers can cause Islam to flourish and become the predominant ideology of the world.",
