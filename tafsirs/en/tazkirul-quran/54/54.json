  "text": "Just as everything in the world is governed by definite rules, so also are human beings bound to follow fixed principles. They have been given the opportunity to perform deeds in the present world, but by the same fixed principles they are removed from the site of action and taken to the place where rewards and punishments are meted out. The power of the Creator, which is everywhere manifested, is enough to ensure that this happening will occur exactly at the appointed time without delay. Similarly, the system of recording existing in the present world is advance intimation of the fact that (in the Hereafter) everybody will be given such treatment as will be strictly in accordance with his deeds. However, all such matters will be comprehended only by one who by nature is inclined to give deep consideration to events and who, going beyond appearances, is able to see the inner latent realities. The present world is a world of trial. Here everybody has full freedom. So, in this world it is possible for a man to gain prominence, even if he lives a life of falsehood in order to obtain respect and status. But nothing of this sort will be possible in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter, the manifestation of the perfect authority of God will guarantee that standing on any ground except that of Truth will be of no avail to anybody.",
