  "text": "The creation of the universe, with its unlimited space and the innumerable astronomical bodies suspended in it, is an awe-inspiring phenomenon. Such colossal creation—an unimaginally gigantic feat—cannot be wholly or even partially attributed to any of the beings whom people worship as deities. The fact is that worship of entities other than God is entirely based on fraudulence. Such practices will continue only till Doomsday, for on that Day, they will vanish as if they had never existed.",
