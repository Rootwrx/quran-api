  "text": "A rebel is given scope for his rebellious activities on account of his being on trial here, and not because it is his birthright. But it often happens that the person concerned is unable to understand this difference. He takes this temporary leeway to be a permanent feature. His eyes do not open until the respite given to him is declared to be at an end and until the opportunity for him to indulge in wrongdoing is taken away. God in His wisdom sometimes has one man undergo this experience in this very world, whereas in the case of another, He allows him to remain in his ignorant condition until death overtakes him, and then He shows him what he was not prepared to see in this life.",
