  "text": "It often happens that those who espouse the cause of unadulterated truth invite the wrath of the upholders of falsehood.  Indeed, they become objects of hatred even in their own communities. But, in the life hereafter, the position will be reversed: the entire atmosphere will favour those devoted upholders of the pure and unadulterated truth; here in this world, having eschewed worldly honour and popularity in their staunch support of the truth, they will find in the afterlife, that they are rewarded with the highest possible esteem.",
