  "text": "God’s book is in a language intelligible to human beings. Moreover, dealing with different topics, it takes into consideration all those aspects which make a book into a book of guidance. The Quran is nevertheless a source of guidance only to those who are serious minded, who are eager to know what is right and what is wrong, and who are ready to abstain from wrong deeds and build their lives in accordance with what is right. Those devoid of seriousness and the desire to learn will merely indulge in meaningless discussions on hearing the teachings of the Quran and will not be able to benefit from them. Those who oppose the call for Truth err in thinking that, in doing so, they will not come to any harm. All around them there is ample evidence of the opponents of the Truth having been wiped out, but they do not learn a lesson from this. Till the last moment they harbour the impression that God’s wrath may have descended on others, but that nothing is going to afflict them similarly. But the law of God admits of no exceptions. Here, what happens to one person will happen to everybody else too; the fate of good people will be good, and vice versa.",
