  "text": "Belief in the existence of Godâ€™s children can be explained in either of two ways: that He is in need of assistants, or like ordinary people, He is desirous of having children. Both of these propositions are baseless. The construction of the earth and the heavens is so perfect that it is unimaginable that their Maker and Mover could be prone to such weaknesses as man evinces. The grand, majestic image of the Creator, projected by His creations themselves, is not at all compatible with the concept of God being in need of children.",
