  "text": "When a man acquires a certain amount of wealth and power, he develops a misplaced self-confidence, says things he should not and behaves in a manner that ill  befits his true position. An incident, which occurred in Makkah, illustrates behaviour of this kind. ‘As ibn Wa’il, a pagan chief of Makkah, owed some money to one Khabbab ibn al-Arat. When the latter demanded his money back, ‘As ibn Wa’il promised to repay the amount if Khabbab disowned allegiance to Muhammad. The latter answered: ‘I will never disown Muhammad, even if you were to die and be born again.’ Hearing this, ‘As ibn Wa’il, answered that when he was born again, and possessed wealth and progeny, then he would repay the amount. All this is false self-confidence and an empty boast, which are of no avail to anybody.",
